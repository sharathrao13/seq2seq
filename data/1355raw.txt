ha , ha , ha .
home sweet home .
thanks , cochise .
no , you fucking idiot !
i've worked at a restaurant my whole life .
shit !
it gonna be that kind of a party ,
i'm gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes !
guess who .
hi , dean .
it's mom .
ah , shit .
i know you're not gonna forget lunch with me , but i thought i'd call just to make sure .
oh , hey .
i forgot you were here .
yeah , i know .
i know .
what?
nothing .
i'll see you at work , okay?
hey , there , natasha .
how's my favorite minor doing today?
hung over .
i got so shitty last night .
on a school night?
kids today .
i must say , there's nothing more attractive than tainted youth .
yes .
i am indeed a pervert .
does that offend you?
nope .
i think that most tainted youths end up being perverts .
good answer .
oh , and monty , just so you know ,
i'm only a minor for another week .
i turn 18 on wednesday .
well , then i guess i better hurry up then .
i don't have much time .
hey , dan .
hey , monty .
how you doing?
good .
this is mitch .
it's his first day .
i want you to show him around .
train him on everything while it's slow , and when the dinner rush hits , we'll have him watch the training videos .
mitch , just listen to what monty says today , and we'll have you out on the floor by early next week .
sound good?
yeah .
all right then .
give him a quick tour before your shift starts .
good stuff .
well , mitch , first thing .
you ever worked in a restaurant before?
actually , yeah ...
well , it doesn't really matter anyway .
working in a restaurant's all about learning a routine .
everything that dan wants me to show you , teach you , all that can be learned in a few hours .
but ... if you wanna work here , in this restaurant ,
i really think that you need to ask yourself one simple question .
how do you feel about frontal male nudity?
what the heck ...
pretty fucked up , huh?
you see , the reason that i ask is most of the guys that work here
like to play this little game that involves flashing their genitalia to each other .
are you serious?
yes , i'm serious .
now , the exact object of the game is to get the other participants to unknowingly look at your testicles and l or penis .
and if they do , you ridicule them mercilessly for being a fag and get to kick them in the ass .
but that's ...
i know .
i know .
it's demented , depraved , senseless .
all true .
now there are rules to the game ... different variations on how to show your dick and l or balls which allow for more kicks .
but we're gonna get into that later .
right now , the first thing that you have to do is look deep inside yourself and figure out if you can take an eyeful of that .
so are you taking any interesting classes this semester?
well , yeah .
i'm only taking the two classes , but i like 'em both .
i really like my teachers .
cool guys .
both have mustaches , which is a little weird .
well , that's just terrific .
yeah .
guess who i ran into yesterday?
who's that?
nancy miller and her son chet .
you remember chet miller , don't you?
oh , yeah .
i remember chet .
yeah .
i haven't seen that guy since high school .
well , he was away at college .
right .
didn't you two have all the same honors classes together?
yeah , we sure did .
yeah , it sounds like he's doing really well .
i'll bet .
seems he just graduated with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering .
wow .
his parents must really be proud , huh?
well , i'm gonna go .
always love these get togethers .
i think we really broke through there .
let me tell you something .
my trainer , that bastard , he didn't prewarn me at all .
he set me up big time .
right around that corner .
okay .
look at the log , bitch .
there are few things in this world more unsettling than going into the back to grab condiments , and ending up staring at a huge , steaming pile of cock .
hey , serena .
hey , babe .
what's up , hangover?
i'm not hung over .
oh , you and monty were crazy last night .
yeah , it was cool .
how about you?
you have a good time?
i would've had a better time if somebody hadn't been ignoring me all night .
was that me?
think monty and i got a little carried away .
oh , i swear , when you two are together .
you're perverts !
all of you .
if you guys can go five minutes without referencing your genitals , i'll be amazed .
i know what you're thinking now .
you think we're all gay , don't you?
think we're all just a bunch of deviant lifestyle living , same sex having motherfuckers , am i right?
yeah .
well , listen .
you can put that faggoty baby to bed right now .
none of the guys that work here are gay .
i mean , i'll stick my finger in my ass every now and again when i'm feeling squirrelly , but that's about the extent of it .
it's absolutely true .
i've seen him do it .
see what i mean?
perverts .
hey , i've seen you use more than a finger .
oh !
bye , babe .
what's up , buddy?
nothin ', man .
what's going on?
what?
what?
what's wrong?
i'll tell you later .
listen , man .
you got nothing to worry about .
it's just a game .
exactly .
and besides , you know , if heterosexual men can't show their cocks to each other ,
then what the hell are we doing here?
amen , brother .
you're adorable .
hey , bishop .
this is mitch .
he's the new guy .
i want you to do a couple things for me .
first , i want you to observe very closely your surroundings today .
take everything in .
leave no mental stone unturned .
can you do that for me , mitch?
good .
then i want you think about what your life would be like if you had been born blind .
thanks , bishop .
go .
go , go , go , go , go .
as you can see , this is a wait station .
this is where you're gonna get the ice , the soft drinks , the condiments , the doggie bags , et cetera and so forth .
that's the computer where you're gonna put the food and drink orders in .
i hate this fucking place sometimes , you know .
why the fuck do we need four more people on at this time of day , man?
look at this place !
it's fucking dead .
i swear , dan needs to clean the shit out of his fucking brain sometimes , man .
fucking asshole .
what are you looking at , fuckwad?
that's naomi .
and she's been working here way too long .
but she's actually a pretty sweet girl when she's drunk .
let's go .
come on , baby .
it's nothin 'like that .
it's true .
you just treat me like a piece of meat .
not just any piece of meat , baby .
a prime rib .
really?
uh huh .
baby , you're oozin 'with sexuality .
yeah , but why does it always have to be about my looks?
just 'cause i dress slutty doesn't mean i am slutty .
okay .
this is for deliveries .
there's the dumpster for the trash .
also , if you wanna get out of the restaurant and chill out , here you go .
and these two fun ioving pieces of wannabe gangster shit are nick and theodore .
how many fucking times i told you , man?
it's the fucking t dog , yo .
sorry , g.
hey , yo , bitch .
what makes you think i won't cut you?
aw .
come on , now , dog .
you know i'm just fucking with you .
you know i give you the mad , phat , superfly , stupid dope , dumb ass , retarded , bomb shit props .
yo , it's almost 4 : 20 , dog .
let's go .
those guys should be sterilized .
and i'm not kidding at all .
you don't talk much , do you , mitch?
actually , you haven't really given ...
that's okay .
'cause i didn't talk much when i first started working here either .
you just gotta get used to your surroundings .
what's up , poncho?
hey , raddimus .
how you doin '?
actually , more importantly , how are you and danielle doing?
i saw that you guys were arguing , and ...
shit , you know , it would be a shame if you guys broke up .
you two are really good together .
fuck off , okay .
even if we did break up , you stand no chance in hell , man .
she got this thing about dating grown men who've had sex with 16 year old girls .
see , that's the problem with women , okay?
they're always trying to project their own values on you .
whatever .
anyway , this is mitch .
he just started today , so i thought i'd give you the pleasure of explaining the finer points of the game to him .
oh , virgin blood .
follow me .
come here .
i wanna talk to you .
thanks , raddimus .
be gentle .
there you go , dean .
aw , thanks , tyla .
you rock .
yeah , tyla , you're the coolest girl in the whole school .
hey , man .
tyla , every time i look at you , i wish i was a lesbian .
oh , what a coincidence .
every time i look at you ,
i'm glad i'm a lesbian .
ouch .
oh , hey , christy .
it's just calvin callin '.
just starting to work the double .
you owe me .
no , i was kiddin '.
you don't really owe me anything .
so , i was just callin 'ya , 'cause it's kind of dead here right now .
so , i don't know .
give me a call back .
i'm at work .
duh .
duh .
come on .
talk to me , goose .
what's wrong?
remember chet miller from high school?
tall guy , kind of smelled like my dad's ass?
that's the one .
my mother told me he graduated with his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering .
yeah , so?
well , you know , we were in all the same classes in high school .
we're the same fucking age .
well , yeah .
but electrical engineering?
come on .
screw that noise .
yeah , but come on , man .
we haven't even graduated from community college .
haven't even got our a. a. degree .
then when we do , what?
what the hell can you do with an a. a. degree anyway?
you can get a job substitute teaching for retarded kids or something .
exactly .
that's the dish area back there .
this is where you pick up the food .
that's floyd .
floyd !
welcome to thunderdome , bitch .
okay , that's the dry area , man .
that's where we keep all the condiments .
right over here .
this is the cooler .
the milk and vegetables , whatever .
back here is the freezer .
you'll find the meat ...
okay , so let me tell you about this little game we play .
i assume monty went over the basic idea with you , right?
yeah , he ...
you know the object , right?
to have the other guy look at you naked .
are you okay with that?
what are you , some kind of a fucking sick , demented pervert , huh?
no .
i was ...
he told me .
come on , bro .
i'm just fucking with you .
look , man , we're all sick .
all right?
now , look .
the main thing to remember is to get the other guy to unknowingly look at your cock and balls .
okay , don't just fucking pull down your pants and say , " look at my dick !
you gotta be sneaky .
i'm gonna go through the positions with you .
the first one's the easiest .
call that one " the look .
all right?
all you gotta do , pull down your pants real quick , show 'em the goods .
if they look , you get to kick 'em in the ass once .
second one is called " the brain . " right?
what you gotta do is isolate your nuts with your fist .
okay , now , take the time to look at it , okay?
because it bears a striking resemblance to ...
aha .
brain .
yeah .
okay .
for that you get two kicks .
so ...
the third one , i call it the " bat wing .
okay .
what you do is you take the excess skin from your nuts , and you take it and you make it flat like paper , all right?
now , once again , you take the time to appreciate this .
you see that it looks all veiny and alive like a bat wing , all right?
if they look , they get three kicks , all right?
but you can't forget this , all right?
you gotta call 'em a fag , okay?
very important .
the game loses it's meaning if you don't humiliate them for being a fucking meatcake .
you got that?
i just don't understand why your mom gives you so much shit anyway .
i don't know , man .
you know .
she's my mom .
she wants me to succeed in life .
yeah .
whatever the hell that means .
jesus , i'm just glad my mom's not like that .
so i called your house today at 2 : 00 .
you were still asleep , weren't you?
that's an understatement .
so what did you do last night?
i trust my little angel didn't do anything immoral .
well , let's see .
i started by getting completely hammered drunk .
it was bad .
then drove while intoxicated to pick up this disease infested prostitute .
uh huh .
from there , let's see .
me and the hooker went back to my place ...
the hooker and i.
excuse me .
the hooker and i went back to my place .
and from there ...
god , it was just a blur of intravenous drug abuse and unprotected sex while taking the lord's name in vain .
dean , did you know that when monty was a child , everyone thought he was retarded?
dean , doesn't my mom look old?
i mean , like , much older than she rightfully should?
so why aren't you and serena still together?
i liked her .
i don't know .
i guess it got old .
we had a relationship based on orgasms .
oh , how charming .
you are being safe , aren't you?
i don't think i could handle the idea of you reproducing .
come on , mom .
of course i'm being safe .
i pull out .
yes , well , your father pulled out too , but we've all seen the tragic end of that story .
you think i wanna have kids?
absolutely not .
that's why i stick to anal sex .
if only i had been so lucky .
okay , so that's the abraham lincoln .
but remember , you have to shave it so it looks like his beard .
otherwise , it don't count .
now the last one .
the last one is called " the goat .
okay , it's a bit trickier .
but if you can pull it off , you are a god among men , all right?
what you do is you take your nuts and your dick , right?
and you tuck it underneath .
pull your pants down , show it , all right?
with it sticking out the backside .
you got that?
okay , well , that just about covers all the different variations that we have .
but you know , we're always looking for new positions .
so next time you got a little down time , you find yourself a little bored , play with your nuts , you know what i'm saying?
see what you come up with , okay?
it's all good .
all right .
i really only have one thing i wanna talk about today , and that's teamwork .
when the dinner rush hits and things start to get hectic , you all have a tendency to start yelling and screaming at one another .
that's just dumb and senseless , 'cause you're only gonna be hurting yourselves .
let's think about it .
if you upset the hostess , she's not gonna seat you .
if you upset the busboys , they're not gonna care if your table's ready .
if you upset the cooks , they're not gonna care if your food's taking too long .
the brain !
ah , shit !
oh , the brain !
i think you're all great waiters and waitresses .
and you should be able to rely on one another when you're in the weeds .
remember , gang .
the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra .
all right .
that's all i have for you today .
let's have a great shift .
oh , uh , push the fish .
it's about to turn .
that's it .
dean , can i have a word with you?
sure .
have a seat , dean .
thanks , dan .
how long you been a waiter?
since i was 18 , so about four years .
wow .
you don't wanna be a waiter forever , do you?
what do you mean?
carson got promoted to gm over at riverside , so we need a new assistant manager .
i'd like to offer the job to you .
are you serious?
heck , yeah , i'm serious .
now i'm not gonna lie to you .
the job comes with more responsibility , but it offers a lot more rewards .
you get full medical , dental , two weeks 'paid vacation , and i might add , a hefty pay increase .
i do pretty well .
cool .
it is cool .
and , let's not forget the power .
right .
control .
you tell people to do things , and they have to do it , or they get in trouble .
i mean , you're in the driver's seat here .
your finger's on the button .
think about it .
okay .
well .
are you okay?
if you're not interested ...
no , no , no .
it's not that i'm not interested , i just ...
sorry , dan , just a lot of things ...
can i take a little while to think about it?
yeah .
oh , sure .
yeah , yeah .
take your time .
yeah , don't rush , you know .
talk about it next week or something like that .
cool .
thanks , dan .
let me ask you something .
what's that?
why don't we hang out?
oh .
like ...
why don't we hang out more often?
we do at work .
you and me .
i was thinking to myself last night , laying in bed , going ,
why don't dean and i hang out?
we're practically the same guy .
l l i sort of have a core group of friends .
you have your own friends and ...
you know what?
you'd think i do .
i don't .
has anyone seen dean?
oh , he's in the back talking to dan .
yeah , you wanna know what they're talking about?
dan wants to make dean assistant fuckin 'manager .
well , did he take the job?
i don't know .
i couldn't ...
he better fuckin 'not have .
okay , whoa , whoa .
hold on .
i gotta warn you .
take my car , what do you think's gonna happen?
yeah , i don't really think ...
score .
okay .
god .
hey , so what was that about?
nothing important .
just bullshit .
what?
hey , there , folks .
my name's dean .
i'll be your waiter today .
can get you something to drink while you're looking at the menus?
hi , there , guys .
my name is serena , and i'll be taking care of you today .
hey , there , ladies .
hi , my name is amy , and i'll be your waitress today .
is there anything i can get you to drink while you're looking at the menus?
yeah , i want a single shot of whiskey and a double shot of whiskey , and she'll have a water .
you know , what the hell?
it's our anniversary .
why don't you bring her a pepsi?
you'll be taking care of us?
i like the sound of that .
i like that .
okay , i don't mean to be a bitch , but the last four times we've come here , the food was awful .
well , i apologize for the food the last few times , and we will certainly do our best to make sure that doesn't happen again .
yeah , that's what the last waitress said .
can i get an extra side of blue cheese?
sir , yes , sir .
right .
blue cheese for you , stat .
have a good day , big guy .
thanks .
assistant manager jackoff .
come on , you worthless dick .
just pee .
fuck .
i'll try the other hand maybe .
goddamn it .
i can't believe you would do that to me .
no , that's it .
do not ...
do not call me back .
hey .
are you okay?
i'm about this close to swearing off men altogether .
let me get you another drink .
all right , see what serena's doing right there?
she's baiting those poor saps .
i love patrick swayze .
yeah?
yeah , you kind of remind me of him .
i guarantee you they're gonna leave her a fat tip .
women , they're so fuckin 'wily .
oh , but poor , amy .
she's a different story .
she was d. o. a. from the very beginning .
and by extra lemon we mean enough for our waters and then some more .
look at the scowl on that woman's face .
it's all my fault .
that would be lovely .
thank you .
thank you so much .
don't worry .
you are too kind .
she'll be lucky to get ten percent .
i'm surprised you didn't give those guys a lap dance .
oh , what's that , jealousy?
women troubles , amy?
i just don't understand what would compel a person to be such a bitch to a total stranger .
maybe she was abused as a child .
oh , god .
i fucking hope so .
oh , man .
you look really pissed .
you really are an asshole .
shenaniganz .
fuck you .
he has a shy bladder .
so is there ...
mitch , go in the back , check out the cooks .
i'll be there in a few minutes , okay?
so , what do you think of natasha?
i think she's illegal .
yeah .
i've made peace with that .
seriously , look at her .
you know she has that scooby doo tongue .
statutory rape .
on the other hand , maybe she is too young .
like that's ever stopped you before .
that is a very , very good point .
and i'm convinced natasha will be mine .
thanks for the advice , buddy .
hey , anytime .
yeah .
what's going on with you and amy?
what's up , obsession?
shut up .
so how long have you two been ...
three months .
shit or get off the pot time .
yep .
has even hinted that he's aware of it?
no , he's acting oblivious .
are you gonna talk to her or hope you're never forced to make an actual decision?
i'm going with option " b " .
that's my boy .
have you talked to him about it?
no .
i'm playing hard to get .
oh , but haven't you slept with him the past five nights?
well , not real hard to get .
she really is a little badass though .
and fun to hang out with .
laid back .
maintenance fees are really low .
i like that .
yeah , she's a cool chick .
i'd do her .
hell , i'd probably even pay .
i would .
i don't know , man .
i'm not even thinking about amy right now .
who are you thinking about?
chet miller .
come on , man !
you're wracked with regret just because some old fuck boy classmate graduated college?
are you gonna take the assistant manager job?
wait .
how the hell do you know about that?
are you fucking kidding me?
you know this place .
people with the day off already know .
half of me is like take the job .
i could really use the money .
it's a smart move .
but the other half's like , " am i fucking nuts?
do i really wanna end up like dan?
busted .
hey , rocco?
it's dan down at shenaniganz .
got another one for ya .
all right .
not on my watch .
and there you go , folks .
damn , boy .
what the hell took so long?
well , you had the two well done steaks , so it usually takes a little while to cook .
yeah , well , could you get me some more ketchup?
sure .
no problem .
nothin 'sets off the flavor of a steak like some ketchup .
and his mouth tasted just like buttermilk .
hey , monty?
could you drop off my food , please?
i can't deal with that bitch anymore .
no problem .
it's go time , mitch .
hey , there , ladies .
amy's busy so i thought i'd bring your food out .
but i still have some salad left .
oh , well , would you like me to take the food back and bring it out in a few minutes?
yeah , and let it dry out under the heat lamps?
just give me the food .
okay .
there you go .
wait .
did that waitress listen to a word i said?
this steak is medium rare .
i asked for it medium .
and i wanted extra gravy on my mashed potatoes .
let me ask you something .
how hard is your job?
how intelligent do you have to be to take a food order?
jesus !
ma'am .
ma'am , you're absolutely right , and i apologize .
i'm gonna get this fixed for you right away .
good .
now i can finish my salad .
okay .
gentlemen , we have our first official bee atch of the day .
oh , come on , guys .
she wasn't that bad , was she?
well , amy , it's your table .
you decide .
she was a fucking bitch !
do it .
yo , we need to get some fucking hydroponics so we can grow our own shit , yo .
hells , yes .
soon as we get the hydro , we can run this city like the fuckin 'mob .
i swear , we gotta grow it , smoke it , sell it .
we'd be a fucking pimp .
yo , and you know the bitches be lovin 'that shit .
we'll get more fuckin 'puss than busta , more than dre , more than fuckin 'snoop dogg .
so it's on then?
we're getting the fucking hydro .
we're gonna run this city like the motherfucking mob .
the first thing we do is add a little extra gravy to the mashed potato .
ah , that's it .
good job , buddy .
nice one .
followed by a thin spread of cheese for your garlic bread .
some " fromunda " cheese .
yeah , make us proud .
fresh from the taint .
we like this .
good .
up next , what we're gonna do ...
how about a little guacamole for the steak?
whoa , whoa , whoa .
what are you doing?
come on , man .
you can't be mixing mexican and continental .
come on , man .
i thought you was better than that .
all right .
how about a little garlic salt?
that's what i'm talking about .
finesse , baby !
these guys have a deep commitment to their job .
finally , a garnish of alfalfa sprouts .
adds a touch of cla ...
touch of class to any meal .
there we go .
oh , god .
good stuff .
i'll pull out my motherfuckin 'shotty .
pull up like john gotti .
i'll have the motherfucker on the carpet .
i fucked that bitch !
hell , yeah , motherfucker .
we be down ...
okay , nicholas , theodore .
boys .
it doesn't take ten minutes to take out the trash .
now , if you don't get your asses out front and start doing some work ,
i'm gonna fire you faster than you can say , " yo , mtv raps .
yes , sir .
i'm sorry?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
hey , rocco .
yeah , right there .
here you go , ma'am .
i had the chefs take extra special care of it for you .
i'm truly sorry for the inconvenience .
don't fuck with people that handle your food .
all right .
how you guys doin '?
everything prepared okay?
could be better .
it'll do .
i'm sorry .
is there anything i can do to make it better?
yeah , get me an extra roll .
and bring me the check .
sure .
no problem .
and i'm gonna sing that bitch a fucking 187 .
all right then , calvin .
just relax and start at the beginning .
okay .
about three months ago i just finished my shift , and i really had to take a piss .
so , i go into the bathroom .
and i'm at the urinal , just waiting for the flow , minding my own business .
when i notice out of my peripheral vision the guy standing next to me was looking straight at my dick .
he's just staring at it like they're old pals .
i could practically hear what he was thinking .
whoa .
that's a nice dick .
and that's it .
since that time , i haven't been able to use a public bathroom .
goodness .
and the next time i tried to take a leak , i could've sworn the guy standing next to me was staring at me , and i freaked .
quit staring at my dick !
in retrospect , i think i might've been mistaken .
what about the stall?
no , it didn't work either .
every time i go to take a piss , i get the image of that guy's eyes on my shank .
and then that's when i start hearing the voices .
voices?
i get this paranoid feeling there are people outside the stall , and they know i'm having a difficult time taking a piss .
i can hear them saying , " what's taking him so long?
why can't he just piss like a normal person?
i don't hear any peel
i'm really fucked up .
psychosomatic auditory hallucinations .
most people have to pay for such a thing .
so what the hell should i do?
well , first , you need to think about how this problem affects other parts of your personality .
oh .
see , i recommend ...
oh , bro , that ain't right , man .
take a look at the bat wing , bitch !
oh , it's so veiny .
damn , raddimus .
does danielle know that you like to go both ways?
how does that work?
sweet victory .
good job , asshole .
i'm sorry .
go ahead .
hello , sir .
my name is monty .
this is my trainee , mitch .
how are you doing today?
oh , i'm slipping gradually into senility .
really?
do you consider that a good thing or a bad thing?
well , it's a mixed bag .
it's good in the sense that i can take walks in my underwear .
i can give small children the middle finger .
but as long as i look happy while i'm doing it , people just assume i'm senile .
yeah , so what's the bad?
well , sometimes i give small children the middle finger and don't realize i'm doing it until someone slaps me .
so i really am going senile .
alzheimer's can't be all bad .
you get a chance to meet new people every day .
i like you , monty .
i like you too , sir .
i like you too , monty .
so what could i get you to drink?
i trust you .
you know what?
you can count on me , sir .
i don't even care if he gives me a poor tip , that is the coolest old man i've met in my entire life .
how's your table?
couple of hicks .
yikes .
yeah , but the check total's $63 , so even if they tip 15 percent i should make 10 bucks .
you're a bastard .
so far i've made 15 percent of jack shit .
jesus .
there you go , buddy .
it's all you .
thanks a lot .
we'll see you next time .
how much did they leave you? $1 . 91 .
no fucking way .
excuse me , sir .
you forgot your change .
no .
that's for you .
that's your tip .
oh , no , no , no .
i insist .
you take it .
you obviously need this more than i do .
i wanna speak to your manager now , please .
this is horse shit .
okay , mitch , you see what dean did there?
don't ever do that .
what , did he stiff you?
he might as fucking well have .
two bucks on a $63 check .
oh , damn .
that is pretty shitty .
for insulting me i should get some free gift certificates and a key chain and a hat .
absolutely , sir .
yes .
and how about a couple of sundaes with some nuts on 'em?
yeah , i will have natasha take down all your information , and i will make sure corporate sends those to you .
you're gonna mail me a sundae?
i want it now .
get in here .
you wanna explain to me what the heck you were thinking?
insulting a customer like that?
you're right .
i know .
i know .
he just ...
i'm having a really bad day , dan , and that guy caught me at the worst possible moment .
i'm sorry .
i lost it .
you're sorry?
i don't understand .
i've never gotten a complaint on you .
and you had to pick the day i offer you a promotion?
i promise you it won't happen again , okay?
opportunity is knocking at the door .
if you don't wanna answer it , fine .
there are people who would jump at the chance .
calvin is chomping at the bit for this job .
i am offering you an opportunity to take it to the next level , earn more money .
i want an answer by the end of your shift ... tonight !
and dean , this is an exploding offer .
i don't work within the exact boundaries of the law , because i wasn't consulted when the goddamn laws were made .
no , instead , nameless , faceless politicians , the so called protectors of the moral majority decide what is right and what is wrong .
i mean , come on !
i govern my life around my own personal code of ethics , and i suggest you do the same .
that way if , within the constructs of my own morality
i were to do something that was considered illegal , so be it .
i feel no guilt whatsoever .
and furthermore , if i were to buckle under the social weight of the system by adhering to laws that i do not truly believe in , then i would be extinguishing the very fire of patriotism and individuality .
it's ...
it's so ...
in a sense , by having sex with natasha ,
i'd be preserving the rights our forefathers fought and died for , right?
well , i guess ...
bro , it was a rhetorical question .
okay?
so ...
oh , hey , dean .
i heard dan yelling at you .
it was kind of crazy .
you think you're still in the running for the assistant manager?
did you ever just wake up and realize , " holy shit .
i'm a fucking loser .
yeah , man .
god , i just wanna be able to say , " i wanna be a teacher , " you know , or a podiatrist or a fucking electrical engineer .
anything !
just have a fucking clue !
hey , who has a clue , right?
hey , i don't .
hello?
i don't know what's going on .
hey , could you put down the ice pick?
sorry you had to hear that guy yell .
oh , it's okay .
you shouldn't have to be subjected to that .
you're way too sweet .
way too cute , too .
stop it .
you're gonna make me blush .
bet you drive the boys wild at your school .
maybe .
i don't really like the boys at my school .
no?
why?
i prefer older men .
really?
wow .
i like a man in power .
yeah , well , being a manager , obviously , i know what you mean .
it takes a lot of power to command the respect of everybody at the restaurant .
that's true .
yeah .
we should go to dinner sometime and talk about it .
i'll bring my manager card , and we'll just eat for free .
as they say , membership has its privileges .
what's up with you?
what are you still doing here?
christy asked me to work for her , so i'm working a double .
time out .
isn't this your only night off this week?
yeah .
and you're using it to work a double shift for christy?
wait .
you actually have to get the pussy before you can be whipped by it .
that's right .
you guys suck .
yes , we do .
wait .
didn't you take out christy last night?
yeah , we went out last night .
come on , man !
details !
fuck the details .
i wanna know .
did you do it?
did you make a move?
what do you mean?
don't give me that shit .
you know .
did you kiss her?
rub against her skin?
cuddle with her?
rub her leg?
hold her hand?
nipple tweak?
anything?
no , i'm still ...
oh , my god !
i need more time .
forget it .
it's over .
you're fucked .
not literally .
why?
because you won't pull the trigger .
and you're too fucking nice !
why do you always say that?
i'm not ...
what happens with every girl you like?
nothing !
you take 'em out , you pay for everything , and you never make a move !
then you home , alone , to masturbate while you cry , using your own tears ...
that was once , and i was drunk and it was valentine's day .
so back off .
don't try to candy coat it .
all we ever do is hang out and have sex .
what are you talking about?
didn't i take you to the movies last week , huh?
huh?
yeah , but you kept trying to get me to jerk you off .
what do you want?
it was a dull movie .
yeah , but i just get the feeling that you don't care .
i don't care?
i don't care?
when my uncle died , didn't i ask you to be by my side at the funeral?
yeah , but you kept trying to get me to jerk you off .
how many times can we have the same exact conversation?
it's like we're stuck in a time paradox where neither our wisdom nor your virginity will ever escape .
i attempt to make a move .
i get in close .
i'm there and i just get ...
fuck !
you need therapy .
hush , now .
the way i see it , with chicks , there's really only two possible things that could happen .
either they won't sleep with you , and then there's no need to call them again , or they do sleep with you , and then there's no need to call them again .
this is what i don't get .
how can someone be such a complete asshole all the time and get as many women as you do?
that's a good question .
amy !
serena !
calvin needs our help .
no .
amy !
serena !
calvin needs our help .
no .
no , i don't need help .
shh , shh .
women like assholes , am i right?
well , i agree that you're an asshole .
okay .
a " , fuck you .
b " , just answer the question .
well , okay .
girls like assholes , not women .
what women are attracted to is self confidence .
yes , and we absolutely fucking hate insecurity .
yes !
the more insecure you are the more you ask , " is something wrong?
" is everything okay?
" what are you thinking about?
what's wrong?
and the more you do that , calvin , the more it becomes this self fulfilling prophecy .
you just need to relax and not worry so much .
okay?
yeah .
that makes a lot of sense .
i'm gonna work on it .
yeah .
yeah , you do that .
and by the way , take whatever advice that she gives you with a big grain of salt .
yeah , and take anything that he gives you with a shot of penicillin .
seriously , calvin , do yourself a favor .
unless you're combing the playground for middle schoolers , don't become an asshole like monty .
correct me if i'm wrong , but haven't i been inside you?
oh , monty .
oh , me .
you wanna brag about your sexual conquests , you big stud , you?
okay , you know what?
fine .
let's talk about it .
let me describe monty's amazing sexual prowess .
he'd barrel into me with that pathetic excuse for a child's penis .
and it would end so quickly , so abruptly ,
i wouldn't even have time to feel any sort of morbid , accidental amusement towards his " technique , " which was basically him seizuring on top of me for , oh , about 45 seconds , while i laid there trying not to laugh ... or cry .
ouch .
is it any wonder why you still date girls in high school?
they're the only ones left .
they don't know any better .
okay , okay .
all right .
first of all , for the record ,
i always had an orgasm when we had sex .
secondly , everybody knows that i'm orally fixated .
you can't deny that i played your vagina like a violin .
oh !
as if that somehow negates the fact that once we got past foreplay , you turned into the little engine that couldn't hold his load .
oh , what the fuck ever !
if i was that bad , then why were you at my house every night?
all i had to do was call and say , " hey .
i'm horny .
and then fucking poof !
as if by some form of slut magic you'd appear .
now why is that?
because at first , i really liked spending time with you .
i thought you were a genuinely interesting guy to be around .
very true .
but eventually , it all wore thin .
i realized that your personality was just one short punctuated joke after another , much like our sex life .
and , oh , monty , do you remember why we stopped dating?
yeah , i do .
because you were old news .
i was looking at other girls and getting bored .
basically , that was why .
yeah , yeah .
all that .
and the fact that i dumped you .
wait , i thought you said you dumped ...
shut up , calvin .
i was just trying to let you down easy , but this is bullshit .
we both know that you enjoyed having sex with me .
the only real pleasure i ever got from having sex with you came from making fun of it later with my friends .
tell him , amy .
it's true .
we laughed a lot at your expense .
so you know when you're walking past a group of people , you hear them laughing , you sometimes get that paranoid self conscious feeling?
maybe they're laughing about you when they're really not?
well , in your case , they really are .
god , i love her .
oh , hello there .
thank you for joining our family at shenaniganz bar and grill .
it is our goal to maintain the absolute highest standard in all aspects ...
hey , man .
we all had to watch it .
i'm gonna come back and get you after the dinner rush .
the tape should be done then .
cool?
well , i mean , i guess .
l ... ... of our most sacred company policies to ensure that you have all the skills necessary
to uphold our standard of excellence .
shit .
are you ready?
well , okay .
follow me .
all right , men .
this is it .
the time has come .
remember , product pride .
portion consciousness .
zero hour is upon us .
let us seize the day !
yeah , yeah !
carpe deez nuts .
god , i can't wait to quit this job !
okay , your waiter will be right with you .
hi there , folks .
what can i get you to drink?
would you like to start with an appetizer?
would you like a baked potato , french fries or rice pilaf?
order up !
is everything prepared okay?
how about some dessert?
and here you go , folks .
i hope you enjoyed everything .
i know i did .
fuck !
the five second rule !
the five second rule !
