all you really care about is gettin 'laid .

thanks .
you know , this is really a great room .
yep .
definite possibilities .
do you think they'd let us put in a little refrigerator for snacks?
are you kiddin ', gilbert?
we can put a fridge and a microwave right there .
that'd be a good place for an entertainment centre , too .
great .
that's just the beginning .
we'll have the best dorm room on campus .
i don't know about the best .
it'll be the messiest .
relax , gilbert .
remember , we got it covered .
this robot will be better than a maid .
it'll help with the women , too .
women?
yeah .
let's say one of us is up here with a woman .
this'll be our warning device , so we don't walk in on each other .
wait a minute .
we're allowed to have girls in our dorm room?

women .
we're college men now .

# our house , our house is burning down
# our house , our house , our house is burning down
# our house , our house , our house is burning down
it must have been the wiring .
that isn't what the fire department thinks .
dean , if my boys say it was the wiring , you gotta believe them .
dean , school ought to be more careful .
we got a big game comin 'up .
i don't want my boys worried about where they're gonna live .
they should have thought of that before they burnt their house down .
what's done is done .
where am i gonna put my athletes?
the freshman dorm?
what about the students there now?
all right .
thanks to faulty wiring , we have no place to live .
right?
right !
these freshmen are sittin 'pretty in there !
so as of now , that dorm is ours !
right?
yeah !
any room you want .
ready?
break !
don't come back !
there's your roommate , pal !
if everyone follows directions , we can manage this move with as little inconvenience as possible .
all right , men .
i want everybody to listen up .
we're movin 'out , and i mean now !
move it !
move it !
move , move , move !
get outta here !
all right , listen up .
i'm gonna see to it that each and every one of you is taken care of .
you will be provided with the best possible food , shelter and accommodation .
we will try to provide you ...
now let's move it out !
move it !
move , move , move !
move it !
move it !
get outta here !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
nerds !
i know this move has been sudden for all of you , and you're probably all still very disoriented .
i do want to assure you that this move is in no way permanent .
it's only temporary .
as you see , we've provided accommodations for you that are ... quite acceptable .
it'll be a nice place for you to enjoy your studies .
i don't even wanna go to college .
you have a special gift .
you need college to develop it .
i wanna be with people my own age .
you will be with people your own age when you're older .
but you can't drop me off in a gymnasium .
it looks like we're refugees from a war .
we gotta go now , honey .
your dad has an appointment .
bye , son .
it is really very comfortable here .
is there anyone here with allergies?
me too .
uh , for those of you who do have allergies , you can request a foam rubber pillow .
also , there's a television for your viewing pleasure .
it is a black and white television .
more good news .
because of the housing situation , we are allowing the freshman class to join and live in fraternities .
yeah !
the fraternities will select their members tomorrow .
all right !
enough of this social bullshit .
grab a cot .
move it or lose it !
go , son .
move !
move , move , move , move , move !
and the delta kappa gamma fraternity has selected as its new members
oliver scott and bill daniels .
for those of you who weren't selected by any fraternities , you won't be left out in the cold .
you can stay here in the gym for as long as you like .
or at least until basketball season .
please answer when i call out your names .
poindexter , arnold .
latrelle , lamar .
lamar latrelle .
wormser , harold .
present .
takashi , toshiro .
ah , here , sir .
dawson , dudley .
call me " booger " .
all right ...
booger .
rakhim , raj .
ah , excuse , please , but why do they call you " booger "?
i don't know .
posquito , lawrence .
daniels , paul .
i knew nobody'd pick us , lewis .
gilbert , it's probably not over yet .
there's a fraternity for us .
dooley , edward .
yozonski , yosef .
wait a second .
are you sure about this?
gilbert , yes .
come on .
hi , girls .
are you guys looking to join a sorority?
a sorority?
no !
we need some help .
we figured pretty girls like you might be able to suggest a fraternity .
choosing the right fraternity can be one of the most important decisions in a man's life .
for sure .
guys like you have to choose very carefully .
definitely .
tell us what frat do you think is us .
you guys are alpha betas all the way .
totally .
for sure .
what?
wait .
aren't alpha betas , like , all jocks and face men?
yes .
but you guys have got that certain something i know they'd be interested in .
i'll tell 'em you're coming .
should we ask for a particular alpha beta?
stan gable .
and you're ...?
betty childs .
thank you , betty .
ms childs .
maybe if you're not busy sometime we could have a cup of coffee or somethin '.
come on , pal .
i can't believe you asked her out .
you know , gilbert , if we get in , maybe we can have our old room back .
these guys will never accept us .
why wouldn't they?
these are the alpha betas .
they're the football players .
i don't think ms childs would have sent us over here if she didn't think we had a decent chance of getting in .
yes?
hi .
tell stan gable that we're the guys that betty childs sent over .
follow me , boys .
gilbert !
welcome .
hi .
hey !
you guys seem pretty cool .
take these for later .
rubbers?
what do we need rubbers for?
let the initiation begin .
have you ever made love to a woman?
yes .
no .
no .
yes .
liars !
all right , let's go for the burn .
ok , takashi , whaddaya got?
oh , i think i have a frush .
what the fuck is a " frush "?
a frush .
i got two sevens , and two sevens beats a frush .
oh , thank you .
oh !
jesus .
so , getting into a fraternity can be the most important thing in a man's life , huh?
you know , that cheerleader set us up , lewis .
i really don't think betty childs is that kind of person , gilbert .
hey , lewis?
what is it , gilbert?
i'm really sorry that i snapped at you .
this gym's really gettin 'to me .
it's ok . i understand .
tomorrow morning we'll find a better place to live , ok?
good night , gilbert .
good night , lewis .
good night , lamar .
good night , wormser .
good night , takashi .
good night , poindexter .
good night , booger .
hey , take it easy .
the computer's your friend .
i wasn't meant to interface with a machine .
well , you're just beginning .
relax .
it's no use .
it's inhuman .
it's not inhuman .
only humans can be inhuman .
here , let me show you .
working with a computer's great .
i mean , it's godlike , in a way , cos you can have complete control .
that's good .
thanks .
you know , some people , they can create with their hands .
but when you're working with a computer , you gotta build something with your mind .
if you're good , you can do somethin 'no one's ever seen before .
it's a definite high .
uh ... what's your name?
judy .
hi , judy .
gilbert .
very nice to meet you .
nice meeting you .
hello , lewis .
hi , gilbert .
did you find a house?
no .
i met a girl .
gilbert !
her name's judy .
judy's a nice name , gilbert .
yeah .
she's a nice girl .
big deal .
did you get in her pants?
she's not that kind of a girl .
why?
does she have a penis?
you gonna eat this?
smell this one , nerd .
oh , coach , coach .
i got to find a place to live .
is ok i leave early?
no .
oh , ok .
you know karate?
no .
good .
i've programmed him with all the rental units in the area .
for optimum efficiency , i've assigned each of you a part of the list .
this'll prevent doubling up .
we'll be able to blanket the area in no time .
booger .
wormser .
toshiro .
nerd !
hi .
all right?
mr wilson?
yeah .
just checking .
hi there , big boy .
hi .
i came about the room for rent .
it's right next to mine .
it'll be perfect for us .
who's there?
what do you want?
is this the stewart residence?
why are you here?
what do you want?
i've come about the room .
go away .
do you have a room to rent?
not for rent .
i thought it was for rent .
fuck off .
hi , judy .
hi , gilbert .
how are you?
fine .
where are you going?
i gotta go find a place to live .
it's horrible you having to live in the gym .
oh , yeah , well ...
what is that?
is that yours?
it's my accordion .
you play the accordion?
yeah .
i love the accordion .
really?
are you very good , or ...?
no , not really .
i'm on my way to class .
do you wanna walk with me?
yeah , sure .
oh , no .
here , let me get it .
i think i found a house .
about fuckin 'time !
isn't it fantastic?
welcome .
are you feeling anything yet , takashi?
oh , booger , i feel nothing .
you better have another hit .
oh , this counter .
could be good .
agh !
feeling anything now?
oh , no .
i feeling ... nothing ... at all .
how about now?
i can't believe what they've done to that house .
that's amazing .
looks terrific , doesn't it , stan?
yeah , well , it won't look terrific for long .
what are you lookin 'at , nerd?
huh?
i thought i was looking at my mother's old douche bag , but that's in ohio .
seven and eight .
and stretch those arms .
come on .
looks great .
come on , wormser .
morning , poindexter .
uh .
agh !
excuse me .
ah , thank you very much .
ok , takashi , show me your cards .
ok .
two and four kings .
that's good , yes?
no , you got too many kings .
so you gotta get rid of these here .
take three of these kings out , and replace them with ... three fresh cards .
oh , ok .
thank you .
when do i deal?
you gotta win a hand first .
i told you we'd find a better place .
yeah .
this is way better than the dorm .
it says " nerds get out .
what is a nerd?
we are .
i don't know what this world is comin 'to .
you see that man over there?
we arrested him for mopery .
what's mopery?
exposing yourself to a blind person .
i'm sorry about your windows , fellas .
it's out of my jurisdiction .
sounds like a fraternity prank .
there's only one organisation that can handle this .
what organisation is that?
the greek council .
our next order of business : new membership .
earl , show the petitioners in , please .
shh !
kneel , gentlemen .
you are the gentlemen who wish to form a fraternity?
yes , sir .
gentlemen , as president of the greek council ,
i'm sorry to inform you that your membership has been denied .
excuse me , but ... why?
according to our charter , you must have a national fraternity as your sponsor .
do you have one?
no .
i'm afraid he's right .
but with a national sponsor , we're in , right?
right , right .
so i guess we'll see you in about , say ... 20 years .
dear sirs , thank you for applying to delta kappa gamma .
we have gone over your application , and it wasn't even close .
ln the future , we recommend that you not include a group photo .
that's 29 rejections so far .
did we send pictures to everybody?
yeah .
everybody except for ...
lambda lambda lambda .
here's one that will see us .
lambda lambda lambda?
yeah .
they're gonna love us .
as you know , we have no chapter at adams college , which is why we agreed to see you .
but i must tell you , gentlemen , you have very little chance of becoming tri lambdas .
i'm in a difficult situation here .
i mean , after all ... you're nerds .
according to your bylaws , you have to take us on a 60 day trial basis .
i beg your pardon?
according to your bylaws ...
he's right , un .
any group that petitions can become a probationary tri lamb chapter .
may i see that , please?
thank you .
well , gentlemen ... you are now probationary tri lambs .
hey .
great , un .
why don't we have a party?
you can celebrate with us and observe us to make sure we're tri lamb material , ok?
great .
we won't let you down .
we'll have the highest grade point average of any chapter you've got .
we certainly won't discriminate .
our chapter will be open to people of all races and creeds .
and sexual orientation .
wonderful .
hi .
remember me?
no .
well , we're having a party saturday night .
would you like to come?
no .
oh , well ...
come on , get it up !
get it up !
c'mon !
you're shit !
you're nothin '!
you're scum !
you suck !
you're nice !
no , i'm not !
stan?
attaway , ogre .
what's up , betty?
is somethin 'wrong?
yeah .
what?
one of those nerds just asked me out .
which one?
i don't know .
they all look alike to me .
yeah .
they can't get any dates for their party .
oh , yeah?
i'll eat their ancestors .
i'll kill their parents !
no , ogre .
ogre !
don't worry about it .
wait a second .
just wait a second .
maybe we could help 'em out .
yeah?
yeah .
and i know just what to do .
come here .
we'll put the bar here , the hors d'oeuvres over there , and we'll pass the cheese puffs .
oh , good .
that sounds expensive .
this party's important .
if we don't impress the tri lambs , we'll never get in .
maybe we can have robster craws .
what the fuck are " robster craws "?
have any of you got dates , besides gilbert?
i do .
yeah , but that's with a guy .
what about you , booger?
i've been out combing the high schools all day .
maybe we should cancel the party .
no , we can't cancel the party .
un jefferson's coming .
we gotta impress him .
we'll never find dates .
# hello , lambda , we're the pis
# and we're here to say
# we think you are special guys
# lambdas all the way
# alpha betas are ok
# if you like sweat socks
# we prefer your high lqs
# to their great big ... jocks
# lambda lambda lambda boys
# really are the best
# won't you take a piece of pi?
# and we'll do the rest
the sisters of pi welcome our newest fraternity , lambda lambda lambda .
we'd like to be escorts to your party saturday night and help out in any way possible .
we got dates !
i've never been out with a girl before .
not just a girl , poindexter , but a pi .
what's " pi " stand for?
hair pie .
what's that?
lewis , where are the pis?
i don't know .
their phone's been busy for two hours .
i don't think un's having a very good time .
it must be the music .
i'll put on something he'll like better .
lewis?
un?
great party .
thanks .
where are all those sorority girls you have dates with?
you know women , they're probably just being fashionably late .
the pis aren't gonna show .
they stood us up .
yeah .
i could call my sorority sisters .
you could?
you think they'll come?
they're really spontaneous people .
i'll call 'em .
crush this ice for me , arnold .
hey , guys , we got dates .
who?
judy's gonna invite the omega mus over .
oh , no , not the mus .
yeah .
they're a bunch of pigs .
hi .
hi .
hi there .
hi there .
hi .
hi .
you can sing along .
the words are easy .
so i say i gotta be free .
so i say i gotta be me .
# so i say i gotta be free
# so i say i gotta be me
# i'm sayin 'you gotta be ...
yeah !
this party isn't going very well , is it?
i don't know why everybody's so uptight .
i don't know either .
maybe we should eat .
maybe we should watch tv .
hey , guys .
wonder joints .
they taste better than they look .
picture time .
oh , goody !
oh , smile pretty , chickies .
oh , thank you very much .
thank you .
hair pie .
oh , hair pie .
nothing .

i have a micon beta link , which hooks this phone to the computer in the robot .
hey , this is some good shit .
hair pie?
thank you .
hair pie?
you built this yourself?
yeah .
i think robots are sexy .
i do , too .
really .
do you want to dance?
ok .
damn !
you mus sure can party !
let's go .
where?
up to your room .
up to my room?
yeah .
are you near sighted or far sighted?
near sighted .
so am l .
really?
yeah .
you wanna switch glasses?
we almost have the same prescription .
yeah .
um , would you like to dance?
yeah .
yeah , well , when i was in high school , i was thinking mostly of the aerospace field .
but then when i got into college , i decided i wanted something more challenging .
so , um , i switched to computers , and now aerodynamics is just sort of a hobby .
wait , wait .
no , no , wait .
would you rather live in the ascendancy of a civilisation or during its decline?
poindexter , do you wanna fuck or not?
agh !
you know , if we get into lambda lambda lambda , we could be partners in the homecoming carnival .
that'd be so great .
yeah .
this party sure worked out well .
# old macdonald had a farm
# e l e l o
# and on that farm he had some pigs
# e l e l o
we thought you could use some more pigs for your party , nerds .
# with an oink oink here and an oink oink there
# here an oink , there an oink , everywhere an oink oink
# old macdonald had a farm
# e l e l o
we'll never get into lambda lambda lambda now .
those jocks ruined everything .
i say we blow their fucking houses up .
no .
we can't resort to violence .
that'll just bring us down to their level .
what do we do?
we gotta beat 'em at their own game .
we've gotta become the best fraternity on campus .
you know , if we win that homecoming carnival , we can take over the presidency of the greek council .
that would drive 'em crazy .
but , gilbert , if we don't get approved by the tri lambs , we won't even be a fraternity .
i say we blow the fuckers up .
no .
we can't do that .
but you're right .
their action tonight demands an immediate retaliation .
and if we don't , we're nothin 'but the nerds they say we are .
i know what we're gonna do .
down , down , down .
come on .
agh !
# e l e l o
# with an oink oink here and an oink oink there
# here an oink ...
where?
right there .
lsn't this gonna make a lot of noise?

yes .
wormser , haven't you had enough?
no .
i think we got even with the pis .
now we got a little score to settle with the alpha betas .
shit !
hank , what is that stuff?
liquid heat .
it burns .
you ought to feel it when i don't dilute it .
get them .
make a pile here .
ok .
here goes .
ok .
don't touch , now .
here , hit this one .
ok .
looks like salad .
the key to each season is homecoming .
you win that one , you got your alumni support .
you got your alumni support , you get that jock dorm , you get the laundry money , you get the new cars .
now , this season started out fine we won some big ball games .
but we were lucky .
we can't get soft .
we can't sit back on our laurels .
we win homecoming , we take league .
we take league , we get a bowl bid .
it's as simple as that .
but , gentlemen , you have got to want it .
do you want it?
yeah !
i can't hear you .
yeah !
we can't let up .
we gotta stay tough .
you can do it .
you can do it .
you gotta believe that you can do it !
you gotta let them know that you want it !
i want it !
good .
shower up !
shit .
we forgot to practise .
you put what?
liquid heat .
on their what?
in their jocks .
that's outrageous .
are you angry , un?
no .
i'm not angry .
i'm glad to see you nerds ... you guys finally fought back .
you'd make a fine addition to tri lambda .
i want to welcome you aboard .
congratulations .
all right !
you'll tell the guys?
oh , i will .
ok , everybody ready?
ok , i focus now .
i set timer .
now say " hi , un .
hi , un .
well , i'd like to propose a toast to un jefferson , who , in his ultimate wisdom , chose to accept us into our new fraternity , lambda lambda lambda .
lambda lambda lambda .
before we take this matter to a vote , i would like it clearly stated in the record ...
miss childs ... that the evidence is overwhelmingly against the alpha betas , and i urge that they be found guilty .
point of order .
dean ulich , i am an alpha beta , and i know that no member of my fraternity could have perpetrated such a callous , heinous act against the nerds ... or the tri lambs .
therefore , i feel a vote at this time would be , shall we say , premature .
premature?
yes .
you see , instead ,
i am going to organise a special , blue ribbon , fact finding commission , made up of myself and ...
miss betty childs .
we will get to the bottom of this dastardly deed .
wait a minute , you can't get away with this .
oh , no , i'm afraid i can .
you see , only the president of the greek council can call a vote .
that's completely unfair .
this is bullshit !
meeting adjourned .
guys , we are never gonna get a fair shake as long as stan gable is president .
the only way to become president is to win the homecoming carnival .
that's right , arnold .
and that's exactly what we're gonna do .
i take great pleasure in officially opening this year's homecoming carnival .
the overall winner will be determined by total points from : number one field events , number two the charity fund raising booth , and number three the musical show and skit competition .
and now , let the games begin !
ok .
the object of the race is to complete 20 laps around the track , while stopping every lap for a mandatory pit stop , at which time the driver will chug a beer .
you don't have a fucking chance , nerd .
oh , thank you .
good luck to you , too , burke .
fuck off .
gentlemen , start your engines .
this is trichloromethalene .
it counters all effects of alcohol in your system .
drink the whole beer .
