hi .
i've got an appointment with mr. uilman .
my name is jack torrance .
his office is the first door on the ieft .
thank you .
mr. uilman?
i'm jack torrance .
come on in , jack .
very nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
this is my secretary , susie .
susie , how do you do?
any trouble finding us?
no problem at ail .
i made the trip in 3 1 / 2 hours .
that's very good time .
sit down a minute , jack .
just make yourself at home .
like some coffee?
if you're having some , i wouldn't mind .
thanks .
susie .
sure .
and ask biii watson to join us .
yes , i wiil .
mom?
yeah?
do you reaily want to go and iive in that hotei for the winter?
sure i do .
it'ii be iots of fun .
yeah .
i guess so .
anyway , there's hardly anybody to play with around here .
i know .
it always takes a iittle time to make new friends .
yeah , i guess so .
what about tony?
he's iooking forward to the hotel , i bet .
no , i ain 't , mrs. torrance .
now , come on , tony .
don't be siily .
i don 't want to go there .
how come you don't want to go?
i just don 't .
did they give you any idea in denver . . . . . . about what the job entails?
only in a very generai way .
the winters can be fantasticaily cruel .
the basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage . . . . . . and depreciation which can occur .
this consists mainly of running the boiler . . . . . . heating different parts of the hotei on a daily rotating basis . . . . . . repairing damage as it occurs . . . . . . and doing repairs so the elements can't get a foothold .
that sounds fine to me .
physicaily , it's not a very demanding job .
the only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter . . . . . . is a tremendous sense of isolation .
that just happens to be exactly what i'm iooking for .
i'm outlining a new writing project .
five months of peace is just what i want .
that's very good , jack .
because , for some people . . . . . . solitude . . . . . . and isolation . . . . . . can , of itself , become a problem .
not for me .
how about your wife and son?
do you think they'ii take to it?
they'ii love it .
great .
before i turn you over to biil . . . . . . there's one other thing i think we should talk about .
not to sound melodramatic . . . . . . but it's been known to give a few people . . . . . . second thoughts about the job .
i'm intrigued .
i don't suppose they said anything in denver . . . . . . about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970 .
i don't believe they did .
my predecessor in this job . . . . . . hired a man named charles grady as the winter caretaker .
he came up with his wife and 2 iittle girls of about 8 and 10 .
he had a good employment record , good references .
and from what i've been told , he seemed . . . . . . iike a completely normai individual .
but at some point during the winter . . . . . . he must have suffered some kind of a complete mentai breakdown .
he ran amuck . . .
. . . and kiiled his family with an ax .
stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing , and then . . . . . . he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth .
the police thought . . . . . . that it was what the old timers used to caii cabin fever .
a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur . . . . . . when people are shut in together over iong periods of time .
that is . . . . . . quite a story .
yeah , it is .
it's stiii hard for me to believe it actuaily happened here .
but it did .
i think you can appreciate why i wanted to teii you about it .
i certainly can .
i also understand why your people in denver . . . . . . ieft it for you to teii me .
obviously , some people can be put off . . . . . . from staying in a place where something iike that happened .
you can rest assured that's not going to happen with me .
and as far as my wife is concerned . . . . . . i'm sure she'ii be absolutely fascinated when i teii her .
she's a confirmed ghost story . . . . . . and horror film addict .
tony , do you think dad'ii get the job?
he already did .
he's going to phone wendy up in a few minutes to tell her .
hi , babe .
hi , hon .
how's it going?
great .
i'm at the hotei and i stiii have a iot to do .
i don't think i can get home before 9 or 10 .
sounds iike you got the job .
right .
it's a beautifui place .
you and danny are going to love it .
tony , why don't you want to go to the hotel?
i don 't know .
you do too know .
now come on , teii me .
i don 't want to .
please .
no .
now , tony , teii me .
we must reaily be high up .
the air feels so different .
dad?
i'm hungry .
you should've eaten your breakfast .
we'ii get you something as soon as we get to the hotel .
okay , mom .
wasn't it around here that the donner party got snowbound?
i think that was farther west , in the sierras .
what was the donner party?
they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times .
they got snowbound one winter in the mountains .
they had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive .
you mean they ate each other up?
they had to , in order to survive .
jack .
don't worry , mom .
i know aii about cannibalism .
i saw it on tv .
see , it's okay .
he saw it on the television .
what time does the plane ieave?
8 : 30 .
that gives us plenty of time to go over everything .
goodbye , mr. uilman .
bye .
good morning .
i hope you haven't been waiting too iong .
no problem .
we had time to grab a bite to eat .
good .
glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen .
is your family having a iook around?
no , my son's discovered the games room .
has your iuggage been brought in?
right there .
in view of aii we have to cover today . . . . . . i suggest we have a quick iook at your apartment and get started .
have the torrances 'things brought to their apartment .
i'd better coilect my family first .
this is our colorado lounge .
it's beautiful .
my god !
this place is fantastic , isn't it , hon?
it sure is .
this is the staff wing of the hotel .
none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter .
goodbye , mr. uilman .
goodbye , girls .
and here are your quarters .
living room , bedroom , bathroom .
and a smaii bedroom for your son .
perfect for a child .
when was the overlook built?
construction started in 1907 .
it was finished in 1909 .
the site's supposedly on an indian buriai ground .
they had to repei a few indian attacks as they were building it .
that's our snowcat .
can you both drive a car?
that's fine .
basicaily the snowcat operates very much iike a car .
it won't take you iong to get the hang of it .
this is the kitchen , huh?
this is it .
how do you iike it , danny?
is it big enough for you?
it's the biggest place i ever seen .
this whole place is such an enormous maze .
i'ii have to ieave a traii of breadcrumbs every time i come in .
don't iet it get you down .
it's big , but it ain't nothing but a kitchen .
a iot of this stuff you'ii never have to touch .
i wouldn't know what to do with it if i did .
one thing for sure , you don't have to worry about food .
you could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice .
right here is our walk in freezer .
this is where we keep aii of our meat .
you got 15 rib roasts . . . . . . 30 ten pound bags of hamburger .
we got 12 turkeys , about 40 chickens . . . . . . 50 sirloin steaks , two dozen pork roast . . . . . . and 20 iegs of iamb .
you iike iamb , doc?
you don't?
what's your favorite food?
french fries and ketchup .
i think we can manage that too , doc .
come along .
watch your step .
how'd you know we caii him doc?
beg your pardon?
you cailed danny " doc " twice .
i did?
we caii him doc sometimes , iike in the bugs bunny cartoons .
but how did you know?
i guess i heard you caii him that .
it's possible .
but i don't remember . . . . . . cailing him that since we've been with you .
anyway , he iooks iike a doc , doesn't he?
what's up , doc?
now , this is the storeroom .
in here is where we keep aii the dried goods and the canned goods .
we got canned fruits and vegetables . . . . . . canned fish and meats , hot and cold cereals .
post toasties , corn flakes , sugar puffs . . . . . . rice krispies , oatmeal , wheatena and cream of wheat .
you got a dozen jugs of black molasses .
we got 60 boxes of dried milk . . .
how'd you like some ice cream , doc?
. . . sociables , finger roils . . . . . . and 7 kinds of what have you .
we've got dried peaches , dried apricots . . . . . . dried raisins and dried prunes .
you know , you got to keep regular if you want to be happy .
how're you getting on?
fine .
can we borrow mrs. torrance?
we're on our way to the basement .
i promise we won't keep her very iong .
no problem .
i was just getting to the ice cream .
you iike ice cream , doc?
i thought so .
you mind if i give danny some ice cream?
not at ail .
we don't mind .
good .
sound good to you , doc?
okay , you behave yourself .
what kind of ice cream do you iike?
chocolate .
chocolate it shaii be .
come on , son .
it's amazing , aii this activity today .
the guests and some staff ieft yesterday , but the . . . . . . iast day's always hectic .
everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible .
by 5 : 00 tonight , you'ii never know anybody was ever here .
just iike a ghost ship , huh?
do you know how i knew your name was doc?
you know what i'm talking about , don't you?
i can remember when i was a iittle boy . . . . . . my grandmother and i could hold conversations . . . . . . entirely without ever opening our mouths .
she cailed it " shining .
and for a iong time i thought it was just the two of us . . . . . . that had " the shine " to us .
like you probably thought you was the only one .
but there are other folks . . . . . . though mostly they don't know it , or don't believe it .
how iong have you been able to do it?
why don't you want to talk about it?
i'm not supposed to .
who says you ain't supposed to?
tony .
who's tony?
tony's the iittle boy that iives in my mouth .
is tony the one that teils you things?
how does he teii you things?
it's iike i go to sleep and he shows me things .
but when i wake up , i can't remember everything .
does your mom and dad know about tony?
do they know he teils you things?
tony told me never to teii them .
has tony ever told you anything about this place?
about the overlook hotel?
i don't know .
now think reai hard , doc .
think .
is there something bad here?
you know , doc , when something happens . . . . . . it can ieave a trace of itself behind .
say , iike . . . . . . if someone burns toast .
maybe things that happen ieave other kind of traces behind .
not things that anyone can notice .
but things that people who shine can see .
just iike they can see things that haven't happened yet . . .
. . . sometimes they can see things that happened a iong time ago .
i think a iot of things happened right here . . . . . . in this particular hotei over the years .
and not aii of them was good .
what about room 237?
room 237?
you're scared of room 237 , ain't you?
no , i ain't .
mr. hailorann , what is in room 237?
nothing .
there ain't nothing in room 237 .
but you ain't got no business going in there anyway .
so stay out .
you understand?
stay out !
good morning , hon .
your breakfast is ready .
what time is it?
it's about 11 : 30 .
jesus !
i guess we've been staying up too iate .
i know it .
i made them just the way you iike them , sunny side up .
nice .
it's reaily pretty outside .
how about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?
i suppose i ought to try to do some writing first .
any ideas yet?
lots of ideas .
no good ones .
something wiii come .
it's just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day .
that's aii it is .
aii right .
and you're going to iose .
and i'm going to get you .
you'd better run fast !
look out !
i'm coming in close .
loser has to keep america clean .
keep america clean .
danny , you win .
let's take the rest of this walking .
give me your hand .
isn't it beautiful?

isn't it beautiful?
it's so pretty .
i didn't think it was this big .
did you?
hi , hon .
how's it going?

the weather forecast said it's going to snow tonight .
what do you want me to do about it?
come on , hon .
don't be so grouchy .
i'm not . . . . . . being grouchy .
i just want to finish my work .
okay .
i understand .
i'ii come back iater with a couple of sandwiches .
maybe you'ii iet me read something then .
wendy . . . . . . iet me explain something to you .
when you come in and interrupt , you're breaking my concentration .
you're distracting me . . . . . . and it wiii then take time to get back to where i was .
understand?
fine .
whenever i'm in here . . . . . . and you hear me typing . . .
. . . or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here . . . . . . when i'm in here , that means i am working .
that means don't come in .
do you think you can handle that?
fine .
why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here?
missed !
don't have !
no fair anymore .
