you know , some folks believe everyone has a public life , a private life and a secret life .
what do you think about that?
see , the thing is , i guess ...
my secret life is a bit less secret than anyone else's right now .
hey , mahowny , you got a promotion , eh?
yup .
so , when are you gonna junk that heap?
why?
it runs .
good morning .
hey , wild man .
you been hanging out where the action is?
i'm always where the action is .
we still hanging out this weekend?
you bet .
we're moving the stuff into the apartment , right?
we should celebrate right after .
how about dinner at vivante's?
vivante's?
are you sure we can get outta there for under 30 bucks?
no?
no .
you just got a raise .
hey , let's not get crazy .
all right?
talk to you at lunch .
good morning .
good morning .
miss selkirk .
congratulations .
mr. mahowny has just become the branch's youngest assistant manager .
i see .
he's been handling
miss selkirk's accounts and trading interests for some time .
well , perhaps we could ... get started , then .
are you telling me that the bank would be happy to lend the money to my father , but has reservations about lending it to me?
we'd just be happier if selkirk international was involved as security .
i thought security was ...
the building itself , with miss selkirk's bond holdings making up the balance .
in addition to which you have my client's personal guarantee .
even so , with such a large line of credit ...
sir .
i'm sorry you had to go through that , miss selkirk .
what was on that sheet?
i thought he should know how much we're making off you .
dan !
you actually make banking fun .
it's all about procedure .
just have to know your way around it .
well , i am very grateful .
one of these days , i'm gonna take you out and get you a decent suit .
bye bye .
bye .
see ya .
bye .
are you sure he can handle a loan of this size at his age?
oh absolutely .
he has an impeccable record and excellent judgement .
what are you doing here?
we got a little concerned when you didn't show .
we thought maybe you were sick or something ...
this is not the race track .
how much you got for us?
i told you , i need a day or two .
that was on monday , dan , this is friday .
look , guys , i'm having a bad run , so what?
just give me 5, 000 more ...
five thousand more? !
yes .
look after yourself or i'm gonna have to do it for you .
what are you saying?
that we're gonna have to come up with a payment plan where you give me a certain amount of money on a certain day and until you're paid up , you do not play !
you can't do that .
i can do it , i'm doing it now .
i thought we had a relationship here .
we have a relationship .
and that is why i'm shutting you down .
for a few grand?
it's 10, 300 .
so what am i supposed to do?
go to the racetrack and watch?
do i make you do business with me?
okay .
okay .
give me an hour .
yeah , give me an hour .
i'll see ya in the garage in an hour .
couple of bozos looking for a loan .
and martin ...
i don't see anyone without an appointment .

yeah .

this is made out to him .
hey , you want it made out to you?
no , but , uh ...
what do i do with this?
you take it to your branch .

it is where i come from .
that is not normal .
i don't like my name on it .
you will when you cash it .

mmm ...
i'll bet you were out at the track .
hm?

we could do things together , the four of us ...
uh huh .
go out , have fun , hm?
did you win anything?
sort of .
how much?
i came home with 500 .
wow .
cool .
ending with a bench clearing brawl , and the puck crossing the goal line .
minnesota leads winnipeg by six points , the leafs by 15 .
yeah , i want 30 on north carolina .
thirty?
hey , dan , you're scaring me .
take it or leave it .
what , are you trying to clean me out?
i really need this one , frank .
you got 30 grand?
you're gonna take my action or not?
i wanna take it , but i'm gonna need a little something from you every monday .
and i don't mean tuesday , i don't mean wednesday .
i mean monday .
fine , 30 on north carolina .
well , she's a nice girl .
belinda's known her as long as i've known you .
is she like belinda?
uh , no .
but , hey , if you don't like her , you know , we'll just watch the game .
why , you got money on it?
north carolina .
one and a half point pick .
right .
so , uh , how's that work again?
thing is , i win if north carolina wins by two points or more .
wow , dan , you really go for it , eh?
you know , we should get some serious play in some time .
like what?
well , we've never been down to atlantic city .
right .
we should do that some time .
it's clubs , dan .
north carolina hanging on ...
this game is over , folks !
no , it's not !
plankton has committed a foul at the buzzer !
oh boy , what a game !
will you look at the north carolina bench? !
have north carolina won by one , two , or three points?
dan , what's your problem?
north carolina have won anyways .
give me one .
just one .
ah , shit .
this is not good .
yes !
give me one .
just one .
north carolina have won this game by just one point .
damn .
and that's all it takes .
unfortunately , a solid team , too many injuries so far this season .
who's for coffee?
bill gooden wants to see you .
sounded kind of urgent .
'morning .
'morning .
alex reismer called about the selkirk loan?
oh , right .
he's coming down to sign out the operating funds .
i'll get the paperwork ready .
what's the number?
they need 200, 000 .
cash .
hey , dan !
your cash is here ; the selkirk account , 300, 000 .
uh , is it gonna be collected today or not?
uh , it'll be here in an hour .
pardon?
an hour?
oh , i have to wait an hour?

something like that .
want me to sign for it?
would you mind?
my pleasure .
oh , great !
thanks .
how are you?
anything to declare?
no , sir . $100, 000 .
thank you very much .
excuse me , sir , there's been a mistake in the accommodations .
my apologies , mr ...?
uh , doug .
mr. mahowny .
victor foss .
i just want you to know that my casino is your casino .
i set aside a table at la gioconde so you can sample our excellent european cuisine .
thank you .
perhaps you'd prefer the hyakida steakhouse?
uh , barbecued ribs would be good , with no sauce and a coke .
mr. mahowny would like barbecued ribs , no sauce and a coke .
thank you .
mr. mahowny , your new room key .
hey , dan .
danny , listen man , forget the tables ; you won't want to keep playing when you see our room !
yeah , it's courtesy of the casino .
really?
take these and hold onto them for me .
don't give 'em back no matter what i say .
understand?
jesus !
that's gotta be at least ...
forty grand .
forty grand !
yes ...
it's a new system i'm working .
you gonna take 'em or not?
yeah .
come back in an hour or two and i'll have some more for you .
okay?
yeah , sure .
all right , i'll see you later .
is that ribs , no sauce?
mm hm .
he's still playing .
i don't want him interrupted , take them back .
and tell them to make some more .
i want 'em on permanent standby , is that understood?
doug , give me my money .
what?
give me my money .
dan , you told me not to , remember?
i've changed my mind .
you brought a curse to that table , you know that?
give me my money and stay away from me .
come on , man , i can't let you do this .
we're talking 40 grand !
forty grand of my money .
you gotta calm down , walk outta here now and think this through .
for the last time , give me my money and stay away from me .
okay .
fine .
fine .
come on , dan .
what?
what are you doing? !
what? !
you lost your way , or something?
yeah .
yup , yup .
yup .
hey , hey , take it easy , man .
uh , you want a rib?
we got plenty , but , uh , no sauce .
i'm putting you on the floor .
you're kiddin '!
i wish i was .
bernie , isn't it?
um , yes sir .
that guy you found in the stairwell ,
mr. ribs , he likes you .
and you're gonna stick to him .
uh , sir , i ...
i didn't do nothing .
well , then , don't do nothing again .
now get out of my office before i change my mind !
yes sir !
and thank you very much , sir .
i won't let you down .
i won't let you down .
thank you .
hey .
hey .
you okay?
where's the washroom?
uh , there , there and there .
okay .
so where's danny boy?
he's busy .
what , he doesn't eat lunch?
work always comes first with dan .
except when he's at the track .
he doesn't go that often .
belinda , you told me yourself !
you've got no idea how hard he works .
anyone who works as hard as he does has a right to do what he wants with his disposable income .
you got that bank draft for me , teri?
bank draft?
from the selkirk loan account .
selkirk ...
um , there is so much activity on that account , i can't keep up .
i know the feeling .
oh , yeah , here we are .
i'm acting for investors looking for short term security .
you've come to the right place .
i was thinking of bearer bonds?
that's not a bad idea .
bonds are secure .
great way of moving money around fast .
okay , so would you like me to open up an account for you right now?
yeah , uh , 200, 000 in the name of roger oskaner .
okay .
hey , you see those bluejays on monday night?
seven to five?
those guys are hot .
oh boy , here comes trouble .
big trouble .
let me guess , selkirk?
nope , oskaner .
oh , oskaner .
he wants to sell bonds at market rate .
mahowny .
banker !
yeah , uh ... where ... where have you been?
i called four times already .
so you wanna hear the lines?
hold on .
hey , banker , you there?
what the fuck? !
uh ...
i can't do this now .
you're not playing today?
give me all the home teams in the national , and all the away teams in the american .
you're kidding?
uh , every game for the $1, 000 max .
you're the man .
the selkirk account seems to be moving at incredible speed .
perhaps we should find out what their schedule is , and advise regional office .
uh , you know , a higher line of credit would be a lot simpler .
okay , good idea .
keep her sweet , dan .
right .
you've opened a loan account for pembro trading?
finally , yes .
i thought they'd run into partnership problems .
i guess things are rolling .
uh , the documentation was all in place ; you approved it yourself .
okay .
and ...
jake arnold .
jake arnold , same thing .
how long ago did we authorize credit?
two years .
and he's never borrowed against it until now?
no , but he could have .
it's strange ; you know , i think he set the whole thing up just so he could tell his friends he had a million dollar credit line .
maybe business got bad .
maybe he won't be handing out jars of peanuts this christmas .
he really does that?
sure .
even his , uh ... desk is peanut shaped .
you're kidding?
no .
what a guy .
yeah , what a nut .
good work , dan .
thank you , bill .
roger oskaner .
what's the problem?
an interest payment overdue .
no problem , he's selling bonds today .
he stopped by to sign the order and pick up his cash .
he did?
i missed him again?
jeez .
i'm gonna have to start bagging lunch , see if i can lay eyes on this guy .
he's a goddamn phantom .
oskaner the phantom .
dan !
you picked one hell of a night .
the pointer sisters are in town .
wanna see the show , just let me know .
thank you .
anything you need right now?
well , uh ... maybe later i might have some ribs .
oh , of course .
and bernie's right here to take care of you .
'evening , mr. m.
ready when you are .
ribs , the man wants ribs .
hello?
hi , dan .
hi .
uh ...
i think there's been a mistake .
dan , i am no mistake .
now why don't you slide right on over here and keep me company .
hello?
he told her that he was only interested in lady luck .
no sex , no booze , no drugs ... our little roller is a purist .
he's a goddamn thoroughbred .
all he cares about is the next hand .
he's a beauty .
he's a beauty !
i love him .
i love him !
the iceman .
you know , i was thinking ...
you know , we could get away .
go away for a weekend , or something .
just you and me .
yeah?
yeah , jump on a plane .
go anywhere .
are you serious?
yes .
'cause i'd really like that .
and there are some really great deals going this time of year .
great , i'll look into it , all right?
i promise .
maybe somewhere hot?
somewhere hot .
okay?
okay .
give me all the home teams , every game , both saturday and sunday .
uh , you want the cfl too?
all the underdogs .
every game?
yeah .
i won't be around this weekend , tell frank i want the one horse in every race , both tracks .
every race?
you don't even know who's running !
for the maximum .
i'll see you monday .
i don't know if frank'll cover you on this one .
i'm sure he will .
have a nice weekend , mrs. quinson .
and when are you gonna get married?
ma , don't bother my friends !
i hate it when he makes stupid bets .
why not?
it's disrespectful to my business and to me .
yeah , but frank , it's easy money .
i'll take his action if he'll play for real .
that way i feel better about taking his money .
yeah !
ha !
ha !
ha !
he's probably mad at me .
they all get mad at you .
they lose , and it's your fault , you know .
very fucked up .
maybe we should get mad at them .
yeah , maybe we should .
maybe we should .
maybe we should .
you know ... you know why he wants to win?
why?
so he has the money to keep losing .
now how fucked up is that?
huh !
so you wanna get heavy?
nah , let's leave it the way it is .
he enjoys it , you know .
he enjoys seeing me every monday .
it's important to him .
anyway , so there's something i want you to get ...
you got enough to shut him down?
yeah , maybe .
but frank perlin's nothing , jim .
i wanna ...
i wanna tap into his whole network .
you got authorization for a tail yet?
yeah .
so how much more do you need from me?
you know how much bell charges for this stuff here?
that's 50 bucks a line .
you got this whole sweet operation going on here .
what do you give me?
uh , nothing relevant .
nothing relevant .
oh , look !
nothing relevant !
i want names , jim .
names !
hey , girl .
hey .
hey , you .
you .
i'll be right back .
hey guys , is there a problem here?
no problem .
you taking a trip?
now look , our deal is i see you on monday .
yeah .
with 40 .
you said 20 .
i know , but now , it's gotta be 40 .
okay , 40 .
i'll see you monday .
is that your girlfriend?
you leave her out of this .
she's pretty .
you kids take care of yourselves .
all right .
we should go to the gate .
who were they?
just some friends of mine from the track .
i don't think you should be seen with people like that , dan .
you work in a bank , they might damage your prospects .
just forget about it .
it's not gonna spoil our weekend .
steve , i got a name here for you .
dan mahowny .
have that checked out for me?
yeah , i will .
mmm !
honey dipped .
honey glazed .
you like it?
oh , i love it !
it's stunning .
but how much is it gonna cost?
a friend of mine comes here a lot .
yeah?
swung me a deal .
oh ... !
i want this to be a special time .
okay .
me too .
just ...
can you believe that?
yeah .
it's very pornographic .
dan !
honey?
yeah .
i'm gonna go for a walk , take a look around .
oh ...
okay .
i got nothing against atlantic city , dan .
victor foss runs a hell of an organization for us .
but hey , vegas is vegas .
vegas is where you come to play .
i guess so .
anything you need right now?
i wanna be low key .
no fuss , no one following me around .
he's at our casino in vegas , in the region of 500, 000 .
cash .
fuck .
fuck nevada .
fucking headhunters !
so what the hell did you do to mahowny?
i ...
i didn't do nothin '.
oh , you didn't do nothin '?
how come he's in vegas and not here?
i ...
i don't ...
i don't know .
you're fired , you piece of shit .
wh ...?
good feel .
all coming to four .
ten on four .
come on , shooter .
come on , baby , you've been good so far .
yeah !
all right !
yeah !
i thought this guy was a chump .
so what do you want to know?
everything vegas doesn't .
his mother's birthday , how he likes his steaks ...
uh , if he wears boxer shorts or butt huggers , you got me?
loud and clear .
come back at dawn and tell me who the hell this mahowny is .
i just heard that mahowny is up over a million .
what?
yes .
he's beating vegas?
mahowny is beating vegas !
okay .
get your man in vegas onto the floor , tell him to shoot him .
sir?
chloroform him !
break his legs !
get him outta there before he loses it all !
now !
bring it home to papa .
all right .
he's hot , he's hot .
he's burning up .
i've been looking for you everywhere .
you know how long i was waiting for you in the room?
honey , just give me a couple more minutes?
i'm on a roll here .
ma'am , could you step away from the table , please?
what?
i must insist ; the players can't be disturbed right now .
dan?
just a few more minutes .
all right?
that's all .
but what about our weekend?
ju just ... a few more minutes .
all right?
roll the dice , please , sir .
come on , dan , stay hot now .
come on , this is your call .
let's do it .
you can do it , man .
looking for a seven or eleven .
seven !
beautiful , beautiful .
beautiful .
everybody loses in vegas .
what do you mean , no record?
i mean , like nothing .
not even ... a jaywalking ticket?
the only unusual thing about him is how many .
how many what?
well , if you move the letters of his name around , it spells how many .
mahowny how many .
uh , you don't say .
i'll file a report .
he works in a bank .
maybe perlin's got plans for him .
laundering money and stuff?
you know anything about the banking business , steve?
i guess not .
i got a brother in law used to work in that bank ... that's ten years ago , but ... you gotta ask permission to get married .
no way .
you think we got a lot of regulations?
yes , i do , as a matter of fact .
he makes 22, 000 a year canadian .
so he's some trust fund punk?
no .
where the hell does he get all the money?
i don't know .
the usual?
drugs? !
no way .
you have to see this guy .
well , i got a little theory going .
it's kind of what you might call a long shot , but i think that ...
yeah?
excuse me , sir , but i thought you might like to know ... that mr. mahowny has left vegas .
what?
already?
he's transferred 250, 000 to our cage ...
he's taken the rest back with him to toronto .
he won?
yes .
you could definitely call this a win .
so ... he's gonna come back .
and he's loaded .
what's this man doing in my office?
who is this man?
pay him , and get him outta here .
and find that kid i fired .
bernie?
yeah .
tell him he's got his job back .
dan?
oh , i'm really sorry .
for what , exactly?
i ...
i never meant to leave you alone .
i ...
i tried to find you but you'd left and i ...
and i guess i just missed you .
i ...
it's okay , i understand .
you do?
you gotta do what you gotta do .
i know you can't help yourself , dan .
you got a gambling problem and we are gonna deal with this together .
no , blin , you don't understand .
no , i've been reading up about this , and the first thing you gotta do is admit it to yourself .
blin , you got things wrong .
just say it , dan .
if you just say it !
i don't have a gambling problem .
do you think i'm an idiot? !
i have a ... a financial problem .
you owe money?
yes .
to the men at the airport?
yes .
and i know what i'm doing .
all right?
you gotta trust me .
please .
i have $2, 000 in my savings account .
if i cash in my retirement plan , it's another 3, 000 .
will that help?
will that make us into a normal couple?
how much do you owe , for chrissakes?
twenty thousand?
where did you get that number?
i made it up !
look , blin , i ...
i know i've not been here for you lately , but things are different now .
i ...
i had a great run last night , and that guy at the airport ,
i can pay him back in full .
and then what?
things will be different .
did we go to vegas so you could clear a gambling debt?
'cause you know why i thought we went there?
i mean , when i saw the room and everything ...
i mean , what was i supposed to think?
why do people go to vegas?
i thought we were gonna get married !
i mean , that's what normal people do in vegas .
it's not how i'd have planned it , but if you'd asked , i'd have said ... yes .
i'm sorry .
i'm ... sorry .
do you want me to leave?
how ya doin ', banker?
so you have a good time in vegas?
not bad .
yeah?
you don't look good .
maybe the little lady didn't let him sleep .
something like that .
thank you .
is it still snowing out there?
yeah .
what kind of snow?
i don't know .
big snow?
big?
i'm gonna take a hint from you .
i'm going to vegas .
you going to vegas?
when?
when's my suede jacket ready?
tuesday .
wednesday .
will you place some bets for me?
yeah .
all right , i'll call you tuesday .
yeah .
all right .
good morning , dan .
good morning .
'morning .
dan mahowny .
these audits can be a pain ; we will try staying out of the way .
uh , i was in audits myself .
so you know the drill?
yeah .
how long do you think it'll take?
ten days .
maybe eight .
so , ten days of this?
maybe eight .
it's late this year , isn't it?
the blizzard?
no , the audit .
everyone's so jumpy .
well , it has to be done , blin .
there's something missing here .
the oskaner file .
i only have a statement and one memo .
dan tends to handle that one himself .
hmm .
no manager's approval , no details of security .
this ... client doesn't even seem to have an address .
ah , the phantom .
excuse me?
i can't help you .
you're gonna have to ask dan about oskaner .
there's one audit i heard about , out west .
the bank's only security system was an alarm that rang in the hotel next door .
did they test it?
uh , of course .
what happened?
the waiter showed up with a tray of beer .
ah , well .
about the uh , oskaner account .
what do you need to know?
there's no way i can pass this .
for what reason?
for a start , he's way over his credit limit .
no authorization ...
it was paid off .
it was?
in full .
he sold bonds today .
well , fine .
that's that one done .
i'm really trying to motor , here , you know?
we're two branches behind .
whatever i can do to help .
no pressure , dan .
we are looking for a strike .
straight down the middle .
oh , dan !
oh , dan !
oh , dan , no !
not so bad !
okay , folks , uh ...
i gotta go .
no !
we were gonna treat you both at swiss chalet !
swiss chalet?
oh , i love swiss chalet .
i'm sorry .
oh , it's okay .
all right .
can i count on you , sir , to make sure the little lady gets home safe?
i think we can manage that .
you go off and do what you have to do .
thank you , sir .
see you at home .
don't you even want to know the scores?
sir , check your pockets?
wow .
sir , step over here , please .
arms up to the side .
okay , go ahead .
we're landing in philadelphia very shortly .
might have left the snow in toronto , but you don't wanna know what the weather's like down there right now .
hey , man .
you looking for a ride?
i can take care of you .
no , thank you .
come on , man .
you wait all night for a cab?
i'm ready to roll , man .
why are we on the highway?
i need to make a stop .
no stops !
it's kind of an emergency .
i ...
i don't care if it's an emergency , no stops !
open the door .
hey , come on !
come on !
what are you doing , man?
what are doing?
hey !
hey !
gimme my car back , man !
let me take care of your travel .
starting tonight .
too many people around here know i carry cash .
i don't like it .
i don't like people knowing my business .
i don't like it .
we can solve this problem very easily .
all you have to do is take the funds to your bank , and they'll wire it through to our bank into an american account .
there'd be personal i. d. requirements , tax stuff .
no .
i'll look into alternatives .
excuse me , mr. foss .
oh boy .
lock up the money .
hey , where's he going?
hey , you're not playing tonight , mr. m?
sure , i'm gonna play , bernie .
i , uh , just needed some air .
yeah .
i've never been out here before , so ...
well , uh , you know , that's on account of the windows .
see , the glass is tinted , so it always looks dull outside .
hmm .
you know , some dude told me they pump in oxygen .
keep you guys high .
huh .
that makes sense .
yeah .
right?
he's on the boardwalk .
it so happens that vegas maintains an account in canada .
name of sunshine clearing corporation .
sunshine clearing corporation?
has a nice ring to it , don't you think?
all right , the deposit has to be in my name .
or an associate's .
just let us know , bring him down , he signs the money over to you at the cage .
all right , what if ... what if my associate's in vegas?
could he sign for it at the cage in vegas?
yeah , of course , dan .
no problem .
i'll be making a transfer to your sunshine clearing corporation account this afternoon .
okay .
it's for my own use , but i need to release 40, 000 to an associate in vegas by the name of frank perlin .
frank perlin .
okay , that'll be fine .
uh , mr. perlin will have to sign for the whole amount and we'll credit the rest to you here in sunny atlantic city .
are there any other ahem details we should cover?
no , we'll take care of everything , mr. mahowny .
thank you for calling .
thank you .
we have a problem with the selkirk account .
what's the ... what's the problem?
i don't know .
briggs has called a meeting with dana and her father at selkirk international , he wants you to be there .
why are they doing this , alex?
i mean , no one except dan has seemed even remotely interested in this project .
we go slightly over our loan , and they're calling my goddamn father in !
it is highly irregular .
we're barely half a million over .
she's , uh ... how far over , exactly?
just under five million .
five million .
mm hm .
already .
incredible .
so you want to give her a tighter line of credit?
absolutely not .
the inspection department wants to classify the loan as risky?
no , we are here , gentlemen , to try and force her father to guarantee the loan .
if he does ,
i want her to borrow every cent we can lay our hands on .
it's a bit of a gamble , but ...
let's not talk numbers .
a few million won't mean much to a man like selkirk .
i'm afraid we now consider the projections to be rather ... optimistic .
in what way?
mr. briggs is referring to the , uh ... failure of the original membership plan ...
failure ...
which was based on tax benefits , which have now been withdrawn .
but our new marketing strategy's becoming very successful .
as you know .
i appreciate the fact that the bank has a big stake in this project .
i'm surprised it hasn't voiced it's concerns earlier .
but i am willing to provide additional security for dana's project , if it'll get the damn thing up and running .
well done , mahowny .
get the paperwork ready before he changes his mind , would you?
yeah?
mahowny's coming down with , uh ... 1 . 4 million .
they just got the transfer .
only , it's , uh ... it's made out to an associate , name of , uh , perlin?
he's meant to sign the money over in vegas .
so?
uh , well , apparently , there's , uh ... there's no perlin in vegas to sign .
what? !
they've been holding a room for him , but he hasn't shown .
mahowny's going apeshit .
who is this perlin?
his business partner?
i don't know .
i don't know anything about mahowny , except if we don't get his money to him tonight , then we may not get it tomorrow .
this is the guy from toronto who plays flat out and you don't know his story?
i don't want to know his story .
are you saying we could be facing a serious judgement call?
only if we know what we don't .
where is this perlin?
toronto .
so fly him down ; he can sign off here .
mahowny's already run that by him .
he says it's out of the question tonight .
if the transfer's in his name ,
perlin's got to sign off at the cage .
that's the bottom line?
that's the bottom line .
i'm sorry , gentlemen .
how about this?
what about we just take the cage
not the actual cage , but the personnel and the paperwork and fly it to toronto?
what are you trying to say?
perlin signs off at the cage , at the airport , in toronto .
i told you , i'm not flying anywhere till my new suede jacket's ready .
you don't have to fly anywhere .
you can collect tonight at the airport .
but it's not monday .
i know .
it ...
meet me at the executive terminal at six .
executive terminal?
by the rental car place , okay?
at six?
i'll think about it .
the call came from 500 temperance street .
mahowny?
yeah .
they're in deep , him and perlin .
how deep you figure?
i don't know , but deep .
what about this airport drop off?
you heard anything like that before?
no , but ten bucks says were onto a drug deal .
no bet .
wimp .
hi .
hi?
hi .
i didn't know if you were on the phone or ...
come in .
where'd you sleep last night?
in the car .
i didn't want to disturb you .
but i thought we had an agreement .
i thought it was ... it was going to be different .
that's what you said , right?
you think we got problems , blin?
take a look at mexico's foreign debt .
we do have a problem , dan !
and you are not giving yourself a chance !
blin , please .
or me !
keep your voice down .
what would you do if you were me , dan?
just tell me that .
you expect me to just ... to sit back and watch you throw your career down the drain , not to mention our relationship?
all right , we'll talk about this tonight .
we both know i'm not gonna see you tonight .
i got you this .
i mean , i figured if you were gonna ... if you're gonna stay out all night , you know , you might as well keep warm .
a winter coat .
i won't see you tonight?
honey , this is great .
will i?
blin , listen ...
no .
no , i'll listen when you have something to say , dan .
hey !

it's got a tv , in the back .
it's got a tv?
yeah , in the back .
what the fuck we doing out here?
i'm heading down to atlantic city .
so what do you want , a kiss goodbye?
give me the money .
it's in the terminal .
you got it in one of those lockers?
hey , you got a new coat .
yeah , it's from my girlfriend .
yeah , it's nice .
why do you walk around
looking like a douche bag all the time for?
some girls go for that , frank .
not where i come from .
where you going?
i forgot a bag .
better to have one to go through customs .
where you going?
it's all right !
how much for the bags?
they're free to customers .
great .
can i have one?
you're not a customer , sir .
okay .
how much for the bags?
five bucks?
five bucks ...
man , that's nuts , you give them away for free .
five bucks .
what are these two clowns up to , you figure?
what are you trying to do to me , dan?
getting you your 40 grand .
" i hereby release all funds under the name frank perlin to be paid to dan mahowny?
hey , just ... trust me .
there's no amount here .
you want me to sign it?
yes , you sign it and then , you get the 40 grand .
all done?
okay , uh ... just a second .
the dame , she looks like tina turner !
good night , ladies .
good night .
have a good trip .
i never gamble myself , personally .
well , i just don't see the attraction in it .
well , winning , i guess .
but there isn't much of that , is there?
if there was ,
i'd be out of a job .
if you ... if you don't mind me saying .
hey , you win and lose .
every time you play , there's plus and minus .
always .
is that a fact?
that's a fact .
well , toronto sure looks like a nice place .
we ... we saw
niagara falls on the way over .
it was just fantastic .
i've never been .

how come you've never been?

seven , nine , five , six ...
i wanna know who chartered that flight and where he's going .
dan !
an honour , as always .
an honour and a pleasure .
okay .
detective murdoch , new jersey state police department .
