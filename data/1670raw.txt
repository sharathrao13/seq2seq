of course .
speaking of drinks , here is yours .
thanks .

and here is mine .
cheers .
come on .
there we go .
let's do it to it .
i just thought of an amazing concept .
what do you say we finish these ... and we go back to my apartment on the beach !
i'll throw a movie in the vcr ... and mix you up a gooey blender drink .
sound good?
sound sexy?
bud , give me another .
i really wish you'd come home with me .
you're so cute .
i'm really good in bed too .
believe me .
and you smell great ... and you look great and your hair's great .
look , i've got to wake up early in the morning .
i have to go .
thank you .
maybe you shouldn't drink so much .
maybe i shouldn't breathe so much .
that's it , pal .
we're closing up now .
i'm gonna finish this .
hey , mr. erection , you want a date?
the room is 20 .
you pay for it .
but only because i think ... that the concept of surrender ... fits with the big picture right now .
hey , get outta the street !
i don't remember if i started drinking ... because my wife left me or ... my wife left me 'cause i started drinking .
fuck it anyway !
next , please .
one moment , sir .
sign the back of the check , please .
can't you just cash it as it is?
is there a problem?
i'm a little shaky right now .
i had brain surgery .
i'll go get some lunch , and then i'll come back ... and take care of it then .
next i'll have a gin and tonic .
do you know what time it is?
you should be drinking coffee .
you're a young guy .
it's none of my business ... but if you could see what i see ... you wouldn't be doing this to yourself .
i understand what you're saying .
i appreciate your concern .
it's not my intention to make you uncomfortable .
please , serve me today , and i'll never come in here again .
if i do , you can 86 me .
stop fucking with me !
i can 86 you anytime i want to .
i don't give a fuck what you do .
that one's on the house , son .
were you in los angeles for the earthquake?
it was pretty scary .
did you have a lot of damage?
just a little bit .
are you desirable?
are you irresistible?
maybe if you drank bourbon with me , it would help .
if you kissed me , and i could taste the sting in your mouth , it would help .
if you drank bourbon with me naked ... if you smelled of bourbon as you fucked me , it would help .
it would increase my esteem for you ... if you poured bourbon on your naked body and said to me , " drink this .
if you spread your legs and you had bourbon dripping from your breasts ... and your pussy and said , " drink here " ... then i could fall in love with you .
because then i would have a purpose : to clean you up .
and that would prove ... that i'm worth something .
i'd lick you clean so that you could go away and fuck someone else .
our business is to make our customers happy .
next , please .
i am back .
i've got my check , and , baby , i'm ready to sign .
there .
steady as a fucking rock .
excuse my french .
want to have dinner with me?
but what's the back end like?
by the time we're through with p and a ... the " above the line " is gonna take it to about 15 .
with something like this , what would disney think?
messages .
what did diller say?
listen , i'm very busy .
just kidding .
can i call you back on this?
ciao for now .
could somebody fix the phones around here?
good morning .
mr. simpson's looking for you .
he wants you to go in as soon as you get
are you all right?
outstanding .
but i have to go to a very important meeting .
could make a couple million for the company .
what?
you should go in there now .
hi , bill .
take a seat .
we're gonna let you go .
this is too generous , bill .
we really liked having you around , but you know how it is .
i'm sorry .
what are you gonna do now?
i thought
i thought i'd move out to las vegas .
my name is yuri botsov .
where you from , yuri?
you sure don't sound like you come from around these parts .
that is very true .
very good observation .
i am from latvia .
very tough place .
i hear this , but i am not a tough man .
i am a humble man who is here to learn from my friends in the new world .
this must be yuri's friend .
sera is my gift to you all .
you will find her a very willing girl for each of you ... just as we arranged .
so , i have business to attend .
please , enjoy .
do you wanna watch?
are you scared?
it's all right .
it's okay .
i bring out the best in the men who fuck me .
it's not easy , but i'm very good .
it's amazing .
i haven't worked for a really long time ... and i can just turn on a dime .
i can just become who they want me to be .
i walk into that room , i know right away ... this is their fantasy , and i become it .
i'm that service .
i perform it , and i perform it well .
i'm an equation mostly .
thirty minutes of my body costs $300 .
that's just to get into the room .
it's about $500 after that .
we negotiate .
but it's a performance .
it's definitely a performance .
i am very pleased with how you've moved up in the world .
it is , after all , a glamorous world i showed you .
why did you leave me in los angeles?
because you are sly .
you knew there was more money here in las vegas .
you don't need to fear me , sera ... because we belong together .
don't we?
are you lonely?
i am lonely , yuri .
so am l .
janek , we called you last night !
there was no one home .
we're 30 miles outside of las vegas .
someone saw him there yesterday .
no , this is the end of it !
yuri knew what he was doing .
that was a red light .
i walk , you stop .
are you sorry?

i walked into the room , and he was lying on the bed .
he had his arms behind his head ... and there was just hair everywhere .
he was really , really fat .
he had a large erection .
i remember he was so proud of his large erection .
i asked him where my money was , and he pointed to the dresser .
and then i asked him what he wanted ... and he said , " lie down , i'm on top .
he started pounding me really hard .
i had to bite my tongue to keep from crying .
he did that for awhile , and then i started to get up .
he pushed me back down , and he held my hair .
he was pulling it , and he stuck his penis in my mouth .
i tried to get up again , and he said ...
stay there , baby , i'm gonna come on your face .
so he did .
then he rubbed his semen all over my face and in my hair .
then he kicked me off the bed and told me to leave .
are you working?
what do you mean?
i'm walking .
just wait one second .
great ass !
want some?
isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
that's pretty funny .
i wonder if you'll take $250 to fuck me?
that is , if you'll come to my room for one hour ...
i will give you $500 .
you're pretty drunk .
not really .
my room's not far .
it's the whole year lnn .
you could drive with me if you want or we could walk .
or i could give you cab fare .
in the car .
whatever you want .
why don't you give me the money in the car?
i'm ben .
i'm sera .
sarah with an " h "?

you can fuck my ass .
oh , my god .
you can come on my face .
whatever you want to do .
just keep it out of my hair .
i just washed it .
just because my feet were too big in the morning
just because i can't remember your mother's name
just because i put the octopus in the bed
just because , because because , because bill cosby
you wanna fuck now?
maybe something to drink first .
more tequila?
whatever .
what's the story?

i don't care about any of that .

that's what i want .
i want you to talk or listen .
just stay .
so , ben with an " n " ... what brings you to las vegas?
business convention?
i came here to drink myself to death .
cashed in all my money ... paid my american express card ... gonna sell the car tomorrow .
how long is it gonna take for you to ... drink yourself to death?
i think about four weeks .
i don't know for sure , but i think .
i got enough for about 250 , $300 a day .
that should do it .
what am l?
a luxury?
you're a luxury , and your meter just ran out .
that's a nice watch .
you do like it?
you can talk a little bit more .
i don't have to be anywhere .
talk .
in los angeles ...
i kept running out of booze and the store would be closed ... because i forget to look at my watch .
i used to live in los angeles .
but i don't anymore .
i think the tough times are finally behind me .
there'll always be bad things , but ... my life is good .
it is as i want it to be .
it's good .
it's good being here with you .
shit .
hey , bill .
how are you?
is this a full night's work?
i'm really sorry .
it was such a slow night , and i couldn't score .
what do you think?
you're just a 16 year old girl on hollywood boulevard?
is that what you think?
ls that what you play?
here .
go ahead .
i could kill you , sera .
you work tonight , and you bring me the money .
it doesn't matter how late .
i will .
he cut me a couple of times .
he'd always say , " never on the face .
so , he cut me right here .
he cried ... and i felt sorry for him .
in his mind , i'd done something bad ... but in my mind i hadn't done anything bad .
he's kind of paranoid .
this ring is a ruby .
it's my lucky ring .

i'll do it .
how are you doin '?
i'm doing fine , thank you .

it was just a wild guess .
my name's paul , honey .
vodka seven .
and for the lady?
are you ready for another one?
sure .
i'll have a margarita .
good choice .
are you alone?
or are you using me to make someone jealous?

i'm here alone .
thank you .
cheers .
where are you staying?
right here at the hotel .
why?
i thought you might be looking for a date .
a date "?
what are you , a hooker?
what exactly do you mean by a date?
i got a wife waiting for me at home .
i just came over to talk .
i'm sorry .
i guess i misunderstood .
i guess you did .
just keep your voice down .
i won't bother you again .
here , have another one on me .
christ .
maybe you should give it a miss for tonight .
i don't know , it's just
i really like this guy .
i've never felt anything ... for anyone i've ever been with , as a trick .
it's weird .
i feel kind of confused about it .
we were with each other only one night ... but i felt like the relationship
i felt like there was a relationship being formed .
i was kind of scared .
i don't think i should see him again .
but i look for him .
i went out last night .
i was looking for him .
where's your car?
i sold it this morning .
i'm gonna take cabs from now on .
what's it tonight?
another 500 to watch you sleep?
what's up?
i was looking for you tonight .
i don't know if you have a boyfriend ... or a girlfriend ... but , if you have some free time ...
i thought maybe we could get some dinner .
are you serious?
i think you know i'm serious .
i'll pay you if you like , but i just want to see you .
i can't have dinner with you .
we could get prime rib .
they've got it on sale for $2 . 99 .
i love that dress .
i had a really good night .
i think things are finally picking up .
we made so much money .
look .
come here .
now listen .
do you hear?
they're talking about me .
are you all right?
get out .
do not come back here .
i'll not see you again .
do you still wanna have dinner?
i think i put too much salt on it .
it's not good .
it's good .
why are you a drunk?
why am i a drunk?
is that really what you want to ask me?
then this is our first date or our last .
until now , i wasn't sure it was either .
first .
it's our first .
i just wanna know .
why are you killing yourself?
interesting choice of words .
i don't remember .
i just know that i want to .
is your drinking a way to kill yourself?
or killing myself is a way to drink .
very clever .
shoot .
can i have another one?
what are you thinking?
are you angry?
good night .
i had the most wonderful  why don't you stay at my place tonight?
look , you're pretty drunk .
i like you .
i trust you .
wow .
that's astonishing , sera .
i hate to think of you in that cheesy motel .
i'll move to a real smart hotel tomorrow if it makes you feel better .
let's talk about tomorrow .
do you want to do something?
we'll talk about it tonight at my place .
i'm not much good in the sack .
it's not about sex .
i'll make you up a bed on the sofa .
we'll talk till late .
we'll sleep till late .
as you know , i am my own boss .
do it , ben .
i'll do it .
this is the home of an angel .
are you okay?
of course .
you look extremely beautiful .
i do?
it's really weird because ... you know ... it's just like this thing's happening ... really quickly .
i just don't know what's going on .
just the second i met him , and the way i said my name .
i just said , " hi , my name's sera , " and that's not what i do .
and it's just
it's all happening really quickly .
i just felt like we've been together for a long time .
it just felt so easy ... and i felt like
i felt like i was me .
i didn't feel like i was ... trying to be somebody else .
when is your rent coming up at the motel?
what do you mean?
i think you should go and bring all your stuff over here .
sera , you are crazy .
so?
don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
that's what i want .
you haven't seen the worst of it .
these last few days , i've been very controlled .
i knock things over and throw up all the time .
right now i feel really good .
you're like an antidote that mixes with the liquor and keeps me in balance .
but that won't last forever .
all right , you go back to your motel .
i'll go back to my glamorous life of being alone .
the only thing i have to come home to is a bottle of mouthwash ... to take the taste of come out of my mouth .
i'm tired of being alone .
that's what i'm tired of .
don't you like me , ben?
what you don't understand is no .
see?
no .
what?
you can never , never ... ask me to stop drinking .
do you understand?
i do .
i really do .
i'm nuts about you .
we didn't know ...
whether to call the police .
he has been here about half an hour .
i know that  mickey had seen you two together .
i wasn't opening the door .
i don't know who , i don't know where ...
i don't know what , i don't know whatever these days .
he's my friend .
i'm sorry .
he must have had too much to drink .
that's why i had him patch the key code .
because he's not gonna do it .
i'll help him inside .
thank you so much .
i'm so sorry to bother you .
no trouble .
you just give me a call if you need any help .
ben , can you wake up?
we gotta go inside , but i have some presents for you .
up we go .
here we go .
this is mrs. van houten .
this is ben .
outstanding , sir .
all right .
here we go .
you're okay?
i'm fine .
good .
i'm so sorry to bother you .
thank you for being so nice .
sure .
all right .
bye bye .
sorry .
i was miles away .
the gifts .
i love that name .
before we proceed onwards , there's something i have to say .
i've come this far .
here i am , in your house .
let me pay this month's rent .
why?
because
because it's better for me that way .
i'll tell you right now ...
i'm in love with you .
but , be that as it may , i am not here ... to force my twisted soul into your life .
i know that .
we both know i'm a drunk .
and i know you're a hooker .
i hope you understand that i'm a person ... who is totally at ease with this ... which is not to say that i'm indifferent or i don't care .
i do .
it simply means i trust and accept your judgment .
i was really worried about how that would be ... but now i'm not .
but you should know that included with the rent around here ... is a complimentary blow job .
i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck .
whatever that means .
open your presents .
presents !
all right .
open this one first .
very nice .
this should go very nicely with my suit ... which , by the way , is the only item of clothing ...
i brought over from the motel with me .
right .
the suitcase was clinking .
what did you do with your clothes?
i threw them out , which was perhaps immoral ... but i wanted to come to you clean , so to speak .
thought we'd go shopping for a pair of jeans ... and 45 pairs of underwear , and just throw one out each day .
that's nice talk , ben .
keep drinking .
between the 101 proof breath and the occasional drool ... some interesting words fall from your mouth .
it looks like i'm with the right girl .
i'm very impressed you would buy this for me .
i'm gonna fill it right now .
do you want to go gambling tonight?
i was thinking we could go and just play for a few hours .
i hadn't planned to gamble ... but if you could keep the bulk of my money ...
i could safely blow a couple hundred bucks .
giving you money makes me want to come .
then come .
i'm sorry .
i love you .
you got a 13 .
hit me .
wait .
she's got a seven .
i don't know .
you tell me .
hit .
i'm busted .
that's all right .
you got it .
you can do it .
wait a minute !
really?
oh , man !
what?
he's okay .
do you want anything?
yeah , maybe a bloody mary .
can you make that?
what?
fuck you !
fuck !
you fucker !
that boy is you can't judge me !
you !
i am his father !
get up !
let's go , guys .
how are you?
very well .
i never expected to have to ask this again ... but how did our evening go?
i remember getting to the casino .
and i remember kissing you .
that was really nice .
and then playing blackjack ... and then security came .
but after that , everything's a blank .
what happened?
they wanted to carry you out and dump you onto the street ... but i talked them into letting me walk you out .
that's impressive .
how did you do that?
i told them that you were an alcoholic ... and that i would take you home ... and that we would never go in there ever again .
we "?
that's amazing .
what are you?
some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies?
how can you be so good?
i don't know what you're saying .
i'm just using you .
i need you .
can we not talk about it anymore?
not a word .
you go back to sleep ... and i'll go out and get us some breakfast .
will you be careful?
don't worry .
ben , i'm working tonight .
i know .
i fuckin 'talk all the time because you never fuckin 'listen to me !
so fuck you !
shut the fuck up .
i'd like a beer and a double kamikaze , please .
we mustn't kick the bar .
we lean into the bar .
just lean into the railing .
it's not vino veritaz .
it's en vino veritaz .
who the fuck are you talking to?
little brown nosed gnomes with a slingshot .
to be in drunk .
lean into the bar?
you lean into the bar .
my boyfriend over there is really boring the shit out of me ... and i was wondering if you would buy me a drink?
do you mind if i buy her a drink?
i don't care what you do with her .
i'll have a rum and coke , please .
barman , a rum and coke .
can i stay with you for awhile?
you mean move in with me?
lsn't this a bit sudden?
i don't have a lot of things .
i don't think my wife would dig it very much .
then maybe we should just go to a motel and fuck all day .
i could suck you like this .
i'm sure fucking you would be wonderful ... but it's almost impossible for me to imagine being with someone else .
now listen , asshole , i'm not just gonna sit here ... and watch her suck on your ear !
shut the fuck up !
i am sorry ... but she and i have decided to spend a few hours together ... in a motel .
and after that , caviar .
baby , wait up !
you're quite a fighter .
here .
listen , this may sound silly ... but i have to ask you to leave .
it's what we do around here when there's a fight .
the men's room is around the back .
sexy .
i'm back .
oh , my god .
did i scare you?
what happened?
fuck , ben .
did you get in a fight?
i thought you said you didn't fight .
how do you feel?
like the kling klang king of the rim ram room .
did you stop at a bar?
did you say something stupid to somebody stupid?
absolutely not .
i was defending the honor of some poor wayward maiden .
i bet you were .
why don't you go take a shower and put on your other shirt?
then we'll go shopping and buy you some new clothes .
i think this shirt is unlucky .
not at all .
your blood tastes good .
we got eggs .
i always had a fantasy of being a flamenco dancer .
i think you look great .
we'll just get you a bow tie ... and then you can be one of those blackjack dealers .
all right?
they wear it because they have to .
i'll wear it because i want to ... which will make me look different .
let's get a drink !
what is that?
what?
holy cow .
it came out of your ear !
i didn't have time to write you a card ... with you breathing down my neck all day ... so you'll just have to wing it , baby .
open it .
they're your color .
i think you should wear one of them at a time .
one of these and one of your other ones .
i was gonna buy you just one ... but i didn't think it would fly .
nurse !
as a gift , i mean .
i'll wear them tonight .
one of them .
tonight .
put it on .
i can't get it .
i'll help you .
you'll be able to feel it , sharp and hot under your ear ... as one of the brothers is putting your head facedown ... into one of the penthouse pillows .
wait !
maybe you should wait .
why?
you can tell .
she really wants you to .
maybe i should follow you around ... and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you .
they wouldn't know .
maybe you should ask me sometime .
be happy to show you .
