where are they?
i don't know .
dad !
uncle merrill !
dad !
morgan !
bo?
bo?
bo , where's morgan?
bo?
are you in my dream , too? ... this is not a dr ...
dad !
hey ...
honey ...
morgan?
what's happening?
the dogs were barking ... woke us up .
are you hurt?
i think god did it .
did what , morgan?
look , lee , i don't even care if it was him .
and you can just have a word with him , and that'd be enough for me .
see , it was strange finding the crops that way .
the kids were confused by it , and , uh , it'd sure take the strangeness away if i knew it was just lionel and the wolfington brothers messing around , that's all .
at the movies?
are you sure?
all right , then .
uh , thanks for your patience , lee .
yeah .
bye .
houdini peed .
i think he's sick .
why don't you take him outside?
i'll call dr. crawford .
he doesn't treat animals .
well , he'll know what to do .
oh .
that was quick , caroline .
i only called you folks two hours ago .
old mrs. kendleman twisted her ankle , as she puts it , diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards .
she went down to thornton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards .
spitting !
by the time i got there ,
mrs. kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place .
and she must have had a cold or something .
i'm telling you , i won't eat for a week .
so , what happened to your crops?
dad's gonna burn these again .
it's contaminated .
you don't even know what that word means .
it's not contaminated .
it's just tap water .
pour it in his bowl .
it tastes funny .
it does not .
and besides , he licks his butt every day .
i don't think he'll mind .
houdini?
bo , don't run .
what's wrong , boy?
stop it , houdini .
look at where it's bent over , father .
it's not broken .
now , what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
can't be by hand .
it's too perfect .
it doesn't sound much like lionel prichard and the wolfington brothers .
they can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants .
i don't think anyone else around here has had any problems .
i was over at theo henry's farm yesterday afternoon , and he would have mentioned something .
why were you at theo's place?
some animals around the county have been acting funny ... and some of them violent .
what is it , a virus?
i don't think so , father .
they're more edgy , you know , and alert .
it's almost like they act when they smell a predator around ... peeing on themselves and everything .
caroline ... please stop calling me " father .
what's wrong?
i don't hear my children .
he fell on me .
he wanted to kill bo .
did he hurt you?
no .
i'm so sorry , morgan .
where were you?
houdini's sick .
tie isabel up to the back of the shed , please , and make sure the knot's very tight .
what's the matter?
there's a monster outside my room .
can i have a glass of water?
what's wrong with the water next to your bed?
it tastes old .
what are you thinking about?
why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
makes me feel better .
does she ever answer back?
no .
she never answers me either .
what?
lionel prichard and the wolfington brothers are back .
it's time for an ass whupping .
this is not an intelligent way to approach this .
lee is a friend of mine .
this is his son .
yeah , we'll be doing lee a favor .
all right , listen ... we both go outside , move around the house in opposite directions .
we act crazy , insane with anger ... make them crap in their pants , force them around till we meet up on the other side .
explain " act crazy .
you know , curse and stuff .
you want me to curse?
you don't mean it .
it's just for show .
what?
well , it won't be convincing .
it doesn't sound natural when i curse .
just make noises , then .
explain " noises .
are you gonna do this or what?
no , i'm not .
all right , you want them stealing something in the house next time?
on the count of three ... ... 1 ... ... all right .
2 ... 3 !
aaah !
i'm insane with anger !
we're gonna beat your ass , bitch !
we're gonna tear your head off !
i'm losing my mind !
it's time for an ass whupping !
i cursed .
i heard .
how did he get ...
are you sure this is lionel prichard?
you like that?
you got an old baby monitor around?
bo had an old baby monitor .
you can use bo's baby monitor as a walkie talkie . ... you can? ... mm hmm .
it only works one way , but that'll do fine .
that is , until someone gets you an old walkie talkie left over at the station .
stop !
it's hideous !
get it off !
l i know what to do .
hey , bo ... turn that down till officer paski leaves .
doy da !
you're too old to still be doing this .
you take a glass of water , and you finish it .
now , what's wrong with this one?
it has dust in it .
this one?
a hair .
this one?
morgan took a sip , and it has his amebas in it .
my turn .
so , how are you , merrill?
fine .
how is work at the gas station?
stimulating .
i never got a chance to tell you , but l i thought your moving in here with your brother after ... it was a nice thing to do .
well , i don't think i'm helping much .
you are .
sorry .
okay , so far i have , " it was very dark .
yes , it was .
you can't describe him at all?
don't you think that's kind of odd?
a little .
i don't know whether to look for a giant or a midget .
no , he definitely wasn't a midget .
okay .
so he was tall?
l i would say so , yes .
probably .
over 6 feet?
it was very dark .
yes , it was .
how certain are you that this was a male?
oh , i don't know ...
i don't know any girls who could run like that .
i don't know , merrill .
i've seen some of those women on the olympics .
they can run like the wind .
this guy got on our roof in , like , a second .
o our roof is 10 feet high .
they have women's high jumping in the olympics .
they got these scandinavian women who can jump clean over me .
caroline , i know you're making a point here , but i just don't know what it is .
an out of town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine .
she scared a couple of the customers .
no one's seen her since .
and my point is , we don't know anything about the person you saw , and we should just keep all possibilities available .
dad , where's the remote?
i don't know , baby .
why don't you check in the sofa cushions?
excluding the possibility that a female scandinavian olympian was running around outside our house last night , what else might be a possibility?
i'm not done asking questions , and i don't appreciate sarcasm .
do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you ... maybe a a church member who ... who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
i don't think so .
okay , i was out of line with the whole female scandinavian olympian thing .
it's just , i'm pretty strong , and i'm pretty fast .
and i was running as fast as i could , and this guy , he was ... he was just toying with us .
there's only food under the sofa .
baby , why don't you just change the channel on the television?
i did .
and?
same show's on every station .
every station?
bo , turn up the volume .
crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life .
they died out by the early '80s , dismissed as hoaxes .
this new resurgence is wholly different .
the speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries .
there are only a limited number of explanations .
either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created , or basically ... it's for real .
extraterrestrials .
what in god's name is going on?
i did some research after i saw your crops .
two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes .
really?
that's how these things have been done in the past .
but there are so many now .
how could so many people be in on it?
i can't think straight .
i'm ...
i'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of edgar's coffee and ... and try to think clear .
and after that , i'll ...
i might make some calls .
but i'll tell you something ... what i said in there , it still goes .
your ... your family has been through a lot .
and the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world .
now , take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things , hmm?
good medicine .
that's good advice .
and you take care of yourself ...
graham .
the footage you're watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34 year old local cameraman in bangalore , a southern city of india .
it's the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours .
uncle merrill , will you turn on the radio?
they are signs intended to be seen from the sky ...
no radio either .
just for a while .
book money?
sure .
just one .
be back for pizza in 15 .
it's just a bunch of crock .
they're trying to sell sodas .
it's plain and simple .
been watching these reports since morning .
i have seen 12 soda commercials so far ... 12 !
you have any books on extraterrestrials?
now , don't tell me you believe this horse manure .
as a matter of fact , i think we have one .
came by mistake in a shipment ... decided to keep it for the city people .
last row , third book on the left , honey .
why is no one saying the obvious?
these are just copycats .
someone somewhere does the first one ...
it was asthma medicine , right , father?
for morgan hess .
and it's not " father " anymore .
in less than an hour , a couple hundred people get the same brilliant idea , and here we are , on the verge of mass hysteria .
can i ask you a favor , father?
i need to clear my conscience .
will you listen to me?
tracey ...
i am not a reverend anymore .
i haven't been for six months .
you know this .
all this stuff on tv ... two girls came in here talking about the end of the world ...
i'm just a little scared .
please , i need to clear my conscience .
i've got it figured .
you do?
i've had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights .
can't tell what they look like
'cause they're staying in the shadows ... covertlike .
nobody's been hurt , mind you .
and that's the giveaway .
i see .
it's called " probing .
it's a military procedure .
you send out a reconnaissance group ... very small ... to check things out .
not to engage but to evaluate the situation ... evaluate the level of danger , make sure things are all clear .
clear for what?
for the rest of them .
yeah?
you got a pamphlet or something i can read?
sure .
thanks .
you didn't used to play baseball , did ya?
shit , i know you .
you're merrill hess .
i was there the day you hit that 50 7 footer over the left field wall ... set the record .
man , that thing had a motor on it .
it's still the record , right?
got the bat at home o on the wall .
you've got two minor league home run records , don't ya?
five .
why weren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'cause he has another record most people don't know about .
he has the minor league strikeout record .
hello , lionel .
merrill's a class a screw up .
he would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time .
didn't matter what the coaches said , didn't matter who was on base .
he would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could .
looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree .
merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players .
you really got the strikeout record?
felt wrong not to swing .
it's contaminated .
carl , there's something wrong with our water .
your water's fine .
bo has this thing about her drinking water .
she had it her whole life .
it's like a tick people have , except it's not a tick .
is that right?
13 !
i cursed 37 times last week .
i said the " f " word a couple times , but mostly ... " shits " and ... " bastards .
is " douche bag " a curse?
i suppose that would depend on its usage .
how about , " john , you're a douche bag for kissing barbara "?
it's a curse .
then it's not 37 .
it's 71 .
pharmacy crowded?
i don't want any one of you spending time with tracey abernathy alone .
is that understood?
is that him?
yeah .
who is he?
what is it?
it's bo's baby monitor .
i found it in the basement .
i'm gonna use it as a walkie talkie .
what if it's catching a signal from them?
it's not .
but it wasn't working .
morgan , this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives .
they're , like , 30 , and they work up little codes together , and they analyze greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in .
they do stupid crap like this to feel special .
it's a scam .
nerds were doing it 25 years ago , and new nerds are doing it again .
it's just static , morgan , all right .
turn it up .
see .
it's a code .
why can't they get girlfriends?
can i see that , please?
it's noise .
it's broken , morgan .
it's just gonna keep doing this .
maybe some new batteries ...
we might lose the signal .
this is exactly what the nerds want .
i'm getting out now .
nobody move .
voices .
did you hear that?
not english , though .
you heard the voices , right , uncle merrill?
i heard them , morgan .
probably picking up another baby monitor .
that's right .
let me see it .
stop !
see , this is why we're not watching tv .
people get obsessed .
i'm letting go now .
no , dad !
don't do it !
you'll lose the signal .
don't let go .
it gets clearer the higher you hold it .
i got it .
bo , honey , i don't want you climbing on the car .
come here .
stop !
there's two of them talking .
isabel , you're gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just make believe .
you're wasting your time here !
i'm not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or tv or anybody !
you're not going to get famous !
okay .
let's turn on the tv .
it first appeared 52 minutes ago .
mexico city officials as well as u. s. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government's air force .
the first sighting was made by an air mexico 747 en route from mazatlan to new york as the unidentified crafts entered mexico city air space .
they were not detected by radar by either country . ... the nerds were right .
we have to tape this .
my ballet recital .
listen , bo , this is very important .
everything people have written about in science books is going to change .
the history of the world's future is on the tv right now .
we need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there .
for your children , bo .
my ballet recital .
dad !
find another tape .
uncle merrill , i'm using your tape .
you are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in mexico city .
this image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way .
what you're seeing is real .
it's unbelievable . ... everything they wrote in science books is about to change .
i told you .
some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world .
that's true .
do you think it could be?
yes .
how can you say that?
that wasn't the answer you wanted?
couldn't you pretend to be like you used to be?
give me some comfort .
people break down into two groups when they experience something lucky .
group number one sees it as more than luck , more than coincidence .
they see it as a sign ... evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them .
group number two sees it as just pure luck , a happy turn of chance .
i'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way .
for them , the situation isn't 50 50 .
could be bad , could be good .
but deep down , they feel that whatever happens , they're on their own .
and that fills them with fear .
yeah , there are those people .
but there's a whole lot of people in the group number one .
when they see those 14 lights , they're looking at a miracle .
and deep down , they feel that whatever's going to happen , there'll be someone there to help them .
and that fills them with hope .
see , what you have to ask yourself is , what kind of person are you?
are you the kind who sees signs , sees miracles?
or do you believe that people just get lucky?
or look at the question this way ... is it possible that there are no coincidences?
i was at this party once .
i'm on the couch with randa mckinney .
she was just sitting there
iooking beautiful , staring at me .
i go to lean in and kiss her ... and i realize i have gum in my mouth .
so i turn , take out the gum , stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa , and turn around .
randa mckinney throws up all over herself .
i knew the second it happened it was a miracle .
i could have been kissing her when she threw up .
that would have scarred me for life .
i may never have recovered .
i'm a miracle man .
those lights are a miracle .
there you go .
so , which type are you?
do you feel comforted?
yeah , i do .
then what does it matter?
i never told you the last words that colleen said before they let her die .
she said , " see .
then her eyes glazed a bit .
and then she said , " swing away .
you know why she said that?
because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died , and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head .
there is no one watching out for us , merrill .
we are all on our own .
what do you know?
well , there was an accident ... drunk driving , they weren't sure ...
he wasn't drunk .
ray fell asleep at the wheel . ... is he okay? ... yeah .
that was the first thing colleen asked , too .
she's talking .
what ambulance is she in?
she's not in an ambulance , father .
for the kids 'protection .
all they were doing was watching tv from 5 : 00 a . m .
i felt like they were getting obsessed , like you said .
they should be playing furry , furry rabbit or tea party or something .
what's furry , furry rabbit?
it's a game , isn't it?
anyways , they closed the schools .
and there's been some interesting developments .
what time is it?
11 : 00 a . m .
they're gone , but they're not really gone .
we just can't see them .
early this morning , a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night .
it stopped dead in the air and fell straight down .
they caught it on tape .
they've been playing it all morning .
the footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky .
they found the bird .
his ... his head was crushed in .
they think they have some kind of invisible shield thing going , l like an optical illusion .
they're still there , hovering .
some people think there's more of them now ...
all over the place , over us , even .
there's a theory about the c ... the crop circles .
they could be some kind of ... some kind of landmark , visual mapping system so they could navigate , coordinate ... makes sense .
want to hear a story?
is it true?
so the aliens can't read our minds .
oh .
oh , of course .
they tell you everything in this book .
it says they're probably very small , like my height , because as their brains develop , there was no use for physical development .
it also says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet .
who wrote this book?
scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs .
that means they're unemployed .
if you're gonna make fun of it , then forget it .
this is serious .
i don't know what got into me .
there are pictures .
dr. bimbu , one of the authors of the book ... ... bimbu? ... dad .
i just asked his name .
you had a tone .
he said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us ... to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe , or the other reason ... they're hostile .
they've used up all the resources on their planet , and they're looking to harvest our planet next .
here .
looks a little like our house , doesn't it?
same windows .
that's weird .
yeah , oh , yeah .
that's enough from dr. bimbu for now .
everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something .
hello?
father?
hello?
hello? !
i'm going out for a few minutes .
no one leaves this house ... no one .
where you going? ... ray reddy's house .
why?
i think he just called here .
you don't think something bad will happen , do you , morgan?
why?
you have one of your feelings again?
is it bad?
i won't let anything bad happen to you .
i don't want you to die .
who said i was gonna die?
who said i was gonna die?
hello , ray .
what happened?
i wrote your number down to call you .
it's been sitting next to the phone for 6 months .
when i knew it was inside the house ...
i couldn't think of any other number to call .
i panicked .
thank you for coming , father .
you're welcome , ray .
i worked so long that night .
i've never fallen asleep driving before ... never since .
don't .
most of the ride home , there wasn't a car in sight in either direction .
if i'd have fallen asleep then ,
i would have ended up in a ditch with a headache .
and it had to be at that right moment ... that 10 , 15 seconds when i passed her walking .
it was like it was meant to be .
i guess if this is the end of the world ,
i'm screwed , right?
people who kill reverends 'wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven .
wh ...
where are you going , ray?
to the lake .
the way i see it ... these places marked in crops and such ... none of them are really near water .
i don't think they like water .
can't be any worse than here .
did you see something , ray?
i know what i've done to you .
i made you question your faith .
i'm truly sorry for what i've done to you and yours .
all right .
and don't open my pantry , father .
i found one of them in there and locked him in .
the startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a 42 year old , romero valadarez .
this video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7 th birthday in the city of passo fundo , brazil .
it was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago .
all initial opinions are this is genuine .
what you're about to see may disturb you .
move , children !
vamanos !
oh !
hello?
the police are here .
i am with them .
i am a police officer .
i just want to talk with you .
we know all about the hoax .
we already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon .
just tell us your name and why you did it , and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others .
don't throw your life away , son .
oh !
ah !
oh !
their skin changes colors .
that's why we couldn't see them that night .
tell me something , morgan .
uh ... in this book of yours ... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
yes .
it said they would probably invade .
they would use ground tactics ... hand to hand combat .
they wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle
'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons .
then the planet would be useless to them .
how could anyone possibly know that information?
it's ridiculous .
what else did it say?
they said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion .
one , they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds , maybe even thousands , of years later .
what's two?
they win .
i'm sorry , what ... what book is this?
is this really happening?
i heard a theory that , uh , they don't like places near water .
maybe we'd be safe from them near a lake or something .
sounds made up .
i saw one of them at ray reddy's house .
i can't be sure , but i got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me .
so ... we can choose to believe this lake idea , pack up , and go , or we can stay here , hide inside our home , wait it out .
we might be overreacting , but i'm willing to live with that .
either way , at least we'll be together .
all those in favor of the lake idea , raise your hand .
yeah .
all those in favor of home , raise your hand .
okay .
my vote counts as two .
that's bullshit !
you're cheating !
morgan , calm down .
i get two votes because i represent two parents here .
we don't know anything yet .
we'll be safe here anyway .
i don't want to leave home .
this is where we lived with mom .
that's got nothing to do with this .
i change my vote .
you can't change your vote .
all those in favor of home , raise your hand .
this is ridiculous .
you lose , 3 2 .
we're going to board up every window in this house .
how do we know boards will do anything?
because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors .
the information we're receiving comes from our affiliates across the world .
dad , uncle merrill !
amman joins nairobi , beijing , and jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights .
there are lights in over 2 74 cities .
they think it'll be 400 within the hour .
they're appearing at or within one mile of crop signs .
they were for navigation .
they made a map .
they're gonna be within a mile of us .
dad?
yes?
they think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver .
i was wrong .
they're hostile .
it's like " war of the worlds .
ground forces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe .
hundreds of thousands have flocked to temples , synagogues , and churches .
god be with us all .
i'm going to get back to the windows .
hey , you guys okay?
some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world .
don't worry .
you won't let anything happen to us , right?
no way .
i wish you were my dad .
what did you say?
don't you ever say anything like that again .
ever .
there's too many windows in the bedrooms .
we don't have enough boards .
we'll board up the bedroom doors .
where are we gonna sleep?
in the family room .
what about isabel?
we'll tie her up in the garage after dinner .
i'll make some sandwiches .
i want spaghetti .
we'll just eat fast , bo .
spaghetti sounds great .
what do you want , morgan?
anything?
french toast ... and mashed potatoes .
now we're talking .
how about you , merrill?
chicken teriyaki .
good choice .
i'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon .
extra bacon .
what's the matter with everyone?
eat .
maybe we should say a prayer .
no .
why not?
we're not saying a prayer .
bo has a bad feeling .
i had a dream .
we aren't saying a prayer .
eat !
i hate you .
that's fine .
you let mom die .
morgan .
i am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer .
not one more minute .
understood?
now we are going to enjoy this meal .
no one can stop us from enjoying this meal , so enjoy it ! ... stop crying ! ... graham ... ... don't yell at her !
all right , since you're all not gonna eat .
i'm gonna try some of everything .
it's happening .
graham , hurry .
did i ever tell you what everyone said when you were born , bo?
you came out of your mama , and you didn't even cry .
you just opened your eyes , and you looked around the room at everybody .
your eyes were so big and gorgeous .
all the ladies in the room just gasped .
i mean , they literally gasped .
and they go , " oh , she's like an angel .
and they said , " we've never seen a baby so beautiful .
and then ... you know what happened?
they put you on the table to clean you up , and you looked up at me and you smiled .
they say babies that young can't smile .
you smiled .
let's go down now .
we forgot isabel .
should we turn off the lights?
they already know we're here .
dad ...
do you know what happened when you were born , morgan?
you came out , and your mama kept bleeding , so the doctors rushed you out of the room before i even had time to see you .
they're on the roof .
while they were fixing her up , all she kept asking about was you .
they're in the house .
i wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life .
then she got feeling better , they brought you in , and they placed you in her arms , and she looked at you , and you looked at her , and you just stared at each other for the longest time .
and then she said real soft ,
hello , morgan .
i'm your mama .
you look just how i dreamed .
the attic door .
let's go .
come on .
we forgot our foil helmets .
have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
they'll read our minds .
you're scaring your sister .
i'm already scared .
merrill .
i'm looking !
they'll know our secret thoughts .
i'm not ready .
merrill !
got it ! ... dad !
where's bo?
i'm okay .
what's happening out there?
i can't even imagine .
i hope they're doing better than we are .
we don't even have helmets .
they're only making noises .
they're not trying to get in .
why would they do that?
they want our attention on the door?
they're distracting us . >from what?
the book says they're probably very good problem solvers .
they'll find a way in .
morgan , give me your flashlight .
they used to pour coal down in this basement .
there's a coal chute in here .
i can feel air .
me too !
it's getting stronger .
i'm close .
what?
hold him !
i got him !
hold him !
i got him !
hold him !
we don't have his medicine .
don't be afraid , morgan .
we'll slow this down together .
feel my chest .
feel it moving in and out .
breathe like me .
breathe like me .
come on .
i dreamed this .
stay with me .
i know it hurts .
be strong , baby .
it'll pass .
it'll pass .
don't do this to me again .
not again .
i hate you .
i hate you .
the fear is feeding him .
don't be afraid of what's happening .
believe it's going to pass .
believe it .
just wait .
don't be afraid .
the air is coming .
believe .
we don't have to be afraid .
it's about to pass .
here it comes .
don't be afraid .
here comes the air .
don't be afraid , morgan .
feel my chest .
breathe with me .
together .
the air is going in our lungs .
together .
we're the same .
we're the same .
we should save the flashlights .
ray's truck swerved off the road and hit colleen and then a tree , and she was pinned between the two .
what does that mean ... pinned?
the truck ... the truck has severed most of her lower half .
what did you say?
she won't be saved .
her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive , and the truck is holding her together .
and she doesn't feel much , and she's ... she's talking almost like normal , and we didn't pull the truck out
'cause we ... we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she's awake .
and that won't be very long .
now , father , do you understand what i've told you?
caroline ... is this the last time i'm gonna talk with my wife?
yes , it is .
people think they came here to take over the planet .
that's bull .
i don't think that .
my friend and i saw them . ... i found a pack of light bulbs .
they poisoned his family .
they dragged them away .
nobody believes it , but they didn't come here for our planet .
this is a raid .
they came here for us , to harvest us .
we're lucky as hell they're leaving here .
they're leaving?
that's what they're saying .
how long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so .
he said they had poison gas ... they secrete in small amounts .
a lot of people died .
but they're leaving .
they left real fast this morning ,
like something scared them off .
they left some of their wounded behind .
why are they going?
people must have figured out a way to beat them .
everyone has a weakness , right?
you didn't think we'd make it through the night , did you?
no .
listen ... there's things i can take and a couple things i can't .
one of them i can't take is when my older brother , who's everything i want to be ... starts losing faith in things .
i saw your eyes last night .
i don't want to ever see your eyes like that again .
okay?
i'm serious .
okay .
he's been like that for a while .
he needs his medicine .
have they said anything about our area?
philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared ... but who knows for sure?
he's not strong enough .
if he has another attack right now ...
i know .
we'd have to be sure before we opened up that door , graham .
it's good enough for me .
me too .
get the syringes 'well .
we may need to give him an epinephrine shot .
the atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic . ... people are celebrating . ... they're doing this on tv .
there's a great sense of relief . ... they're dancing . ... yeah , like this .
as we begin evaluating the loss of life , ... do you want to see it? ... we will be left with a lot of questions . ... i'll bring the tv in here . ... i see the same expression on every face .
we know the battle turned around in the middle east .
three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them .
we have no further details at this time .
merrill , wait .
hi , sweetie .
hi , baby .
i was ... just taking a walk before dinner .
you love walks .
it was meant to be .
does it hurt?
i don't feel much .
good .
tell morgan ... to play games .
it's okay to be silly .
i will .
tell bo to listen to her brother .
he'll always take care of her .
i will .
and tell graham ...
i'm here .
tell him ... see .
tell him to see .
and tell merrill to swing away .
see , what you have to ask yourself is , what kind of person are you?
are you the kind that sees signs , sees miracles?
or do you believe that people just get lucky?
is it possible ... there are no coincidences?
swing away , merrill .
merrill ... swing away .
that's why he had asthma .
it can't be luck .
his lungs were closed .
no poison got in .
his lungs were closed .
don't touch him .
give him a minute .
graham ...
give him a second .
d daddy ...
don't touch him .
graham ...
don't ... don't .
dad?
what happened?
did someone save me?
yeah , baby , i think someone did .
