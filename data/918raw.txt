how're things in town?
terrible .
with rationing , people'd eat their shoes .
it's touchy .
they have no smarts .
it's a mess .

they'll never grow back .
you're no optimist .
get that into your skull , for chrissake !
your hair isn't growing back .

i like the smell of glue .
it smells like fish .
it brings back memories .

thinking about her again?
they say she hears voices now .

a girl invites you to her home ... a bit improper , maybe?
well , actually ...
i wanted to thank you for this morning .
thank me for what?
you rescued my package in the stairs .
i was moved by your gesture .
it's only natural .
but usually , people only think of themselves ... ... these days .
it's normal , ... they have nothing .
deep down , they're good people .
i'm glad they like me .
they're very kind .
things're fine with your dad too .
i believe he thinks i'm a nice guy .
why not try gourmet cheese spread?
that's new !
and it's handy .
they talk to me about you .
who?
the voices in my head .
of course , the voices !
what do they say?
let me think ...
they talk in such a way ...
do they talk about love?
aurore , you're missing something hilarious !
anyway , i have no choice .
here ...
tomorrow , at 11 sharp .
ring !
don't let me down .
move out?
what for?
i've just moved in !
this place isn't that great .
its insanitary , the walls are crumbling , it leaks ...
maybe you don't like me?
you act as if you want me to leave ...
on the contrary , ...
that's not what i meant .
it does that ... sometimes .
did i hurt you?
i'm alright .
we really clashed .
i'm so clumsy .
don't budge .
i'm blind as a mole .
everything's foggy .
i could get lost in it .
since i break things , i always buy two .
you play the cello .
i play music too .
wait , i'll be back .
shit not again !
what're you doing?
i wanted to take a bath .

you're better off here .
at least , we got a system .
