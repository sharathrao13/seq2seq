leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake ...
i walk through the valley of the shadow ...

jer , is that you?
you're with dan?
where did you guys park?
tom !
okay .
sorry .
there's a hell of a fender bender coming in , and ...
please continue .
i'm so sorry .
l 5 was a parking lot .
i made it .
then the earth shook and trembled ...
sorry , padre .
my bad .
missed an exit . ... because he was wroth .
he bowed the heavens also and came down .
and darkness was ...
did you notice how many hot chicks were at that funeral?
no kidding !
it was like a discotheque with a coffin in the middle .
look at that .
holy ...
fort cooper .
can you believe it?
god , i remember it being taller .
there it is .
race you to the top !
dano , come on up !
come on , dan .
you guys are hammered !
i'm not climbing up a 20 year old rope .
that's crazy .
tommy , catch .
this whole thing seems a little insane for us to be doing , climbing with the possibility of ...
you all right , dano?
come on , dano , grab it .
give me the rope .
come on , dan !
use your tippy toes .
there you go .
cobweb .
look out .
oh , my god .
how small is that door?
kind of seems about the same , actually .
i hope i don't fall through the floor of this thing .
hey !
what's up , b. a. baracus?
mr. t. how awesome is that?
you guys .
oh , my gosh .
look at this .
hey , that's our old flag .
d. b. cooper's treasure chest .
oh , man , look at that thing .
you remember this?
of course , yeah .
cooper parachuted out of a plane up north with a bunch of stolen cash .
we were obsessed with that .
nationwide police hunt and ...
right .
never found .
yeah , we were gonna sneak away , go up the river , all huck finn , apocalypse now style .
get the loot .
i bet you we spent half our childhood planning that trip .
it's all billy ever talked about .
let's open it up .
we have to break the lock .
oh , i'll break it .
38 24 36 .
how did he know that?
how do you possibly remember that?
miss 1981 , julie mcdonald .
38 24 36 .
unforgettable .
had a passion for cycling .
disliked liars .
you're right .
what the ...?
do you believe it?
man !
look at that .
the oath ...
we swear that these things will remain in this box until we find d. b. cooper's treasure .
signed , a bunch of kids .
remember we pricked our fingers , took a blood oath?
dan , what's that next to your signature?
that's not blood .
it was earwax .
i was afraid of needles .
should we check out the priceless treasures of our youth?
c 3po .
i wonder who put that in .
let me see .
that's a collectible now .
yeah , right .
my brian bosworth rookie card .
the boz .
man , i thought he was gonna be the greatest ever .
i've been in that box a very long time .
well , you're free now .
and , tom , i believe this is your contribution .
oh , my god .
that's my first rubber .
boy ...
i found this in my dad's pickup right before he went to jail .
i remember he caught me with it .
boy , he smacked me right in the head .
what a charming father and son tale .
he was funny .
hey , what did billy put in there?
yeah , what does he got?
his indy compass .
i gave this to him before he took off on his trip .
he must've ...
i don't know , he must've put it back .
look at this .
it's one of our mix tapes .
remember we did the dj intros?
yeah , let's not wang chung tonight .
burn that .
you guys , check out this map .
looks like billy left us a treasure map .
look at that .
not only that ...
this map looks new .
he plotted out the whole trip .
billy thought d. b. landed right here .
there's no way he did this as a kid .
he must've been adding to the box over the years .
this is the camping trip he wanted us to take last summer .
i couldn't go .
i was detained in mexico .
and he wouldn't do it unless we were all together .
i swear to god , i think he figured it out .
i mean , look at all this research .
he reconstructed the jump .
he pinpointed d. b. 's landing .
that's crazy .
my god ...
i'm sorry , you guys , we made an oath .
it all goes back in the box .
it all goes back in the box until we find the treasure .
so let's go find it .
let's ...
let's take billy's trip .
come on , guys , what do you say?
i say , " hell , yes .
hell , yes !
right?
we'll get a canoe .
right?
no .
no .
no , i'm ...
no .
we're all going .
listen , i wanna get a lot of rope .
a rope's good .
all right , i know you guys won't grasp this concept , but i have patients and ...
i am a doctor now .
i am dr. mott now !
i have responsibilities !
your responsibility is to come treasure hunting with us .
we're 30 .
this might be the last chance we have to do something incredibly stupid together .
i agree .
for billy , dano .
not fair .
i think it's fair .
all right .
time to re up on our oath , boys .
fingers up .
hey , put that away .
tom ...
i love the way you work .
you know who i'm talking to .
there's no way i'm going .
no chance !
no !
you guys , no !
hey .
let go of me !
hey !
no , no .
no !
i hate you guys .
oh , we hate you too , dr. quinn , medicine woman .
hey !
hey !
i agreed to come .
you said i could drive .
we drive by my rules .
no kissing me .
i can't believe that billy kept the duke in running shape all these years .
318 v8 , man .
they're bulletproof .
how about a little fort cooper classic .
this is rocking billy newwood .
i'm here with fellow djs
jazzy jerry .
yeah !
gonzo tommy .
yeah !
and disco dan .
burn , baby , burn !
i've had sex with tom .
i totally did , though .
usually it's too late when you do you know the words?
realize what you had
and my mind goes back to a girl i left some years ago
who told me
just hold on loosely
but don't let go
the boys together , the open road .
good tunes , good times .
good god !
let's pull off memory highway .
but i'm never off , always on to the break of dawn
c o m p t o n
and the city they call long beach
putting the shit together
if it's good enough to take them off a proper chunk
i'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff
it's like this and like that and like this and ...
how do you know all these words?
he's a doctor .
doctors study other doctors 'work .
you're a secret dr. dre fan .
oh , god .
it's like this and like that and like this ...
no , this is a metropolis .
look at this .
this place is very remote .
i wish i would've brought my dancing shoes so we can go clubbing .
let's find the nearest hospital .
stay at the ritz .
this is great .
how are you?
hi .
where are we?
corner of bumfuck and you got a purty mouth .
hey , i'm gonna make a call .
oh , wait , jerry , you should use my new cell phone .
it's a satellite phone , so it works everywhere .
and it's got a camera and it's got an address book and , listen , it's even got a personalized ring .
nice .
you shouldn't be proud of that , dan .
thanks .
you're welcome .
well ,
i'm gonna go check out the canoe situation .
you want anything?
good luck .
no , i'm good .
hello?
denise .
what are you doing home?
hey .
hi .
is everything all right?
you know ...
it's as good as it can be .
where are you?
on the road .
good .
you're on your way home .
what time do you get in?
i can't wait to see you .
what you looking at , boy?
here's the thing , the guys and i ...
we're going on a treasure hunt .
and i know that sounds dumb , but it's something that we have to do .
for billy .
that doesn't sound dumb at all .
i completely understand .
you do?
just call me when you get a chance .
but i might be out of the house .
for a bit .
yeah , because my girlfriends and i , we're gonna go on a search for the lost city of atlantis .
maybe my treasure will help buy your submarine .
maybe .
maybe it will .
take a picture .
hold on .
i'm on the little guy's back .
shut up .
go , take a picture .
that's good .
that's good .
hello?
that did not sound like it went well .
hiya , boys .
nice day .
just passing through?
no .
we're actually from ups .
looks like someone ordered a set of teeth .
i beg your pardon .
taser guns .
dropping them off .
anyways ...
so help me out here , boys .
where was it you said you was headed?
we're just taking a trip .
our old friend , billy , he made this map ...
quiet time .
quiet .
we're just taking a day trip up spirit river , your honor .
pretty thick country up there .
you make a couple mistakes up there , you're gone .
you know what , i think we'll be okay .
i was a boy scout .
tom , you were a boy scout , weren't you?
no .
but i ate a brownie once .
you don't wanna play on the big river , boys .
oh , no , we're not playing , we're ...
i got this .
you listen to me .
i know a thing or two about rapid riding because i was a white water guide in northern california , nocal .
here's the thing .
i know how to read a river better than you can read a book .
just a little better .
all right .
all right .
so we're gonna get going?
that's right .
thank you , sheriff .
see you , ray bans .
you think we got enough booze , tom?
maybe you wanna hire a bartender to come on the trip with us .
what's a camping trip without beer?
well , it's still a camping trip , actually , just with less vomiting .
i hear you're a river guide .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
class iv , v?
which is it?
why don't you try putting those numbers together .
that's right .
i've shot a class 45 , and i've never lost a man .
lie to me .
i don't care .
i'm not the one that's going to drown .
all right , fellas .
here we go .
attention .
we christen you
duke il .
thanks for breaking glass where my kids play .
there's a transmitter in the canoe .
that way , if you guys disappear , at least we'll get our boat back .
it's child's play , guy .
we got it .
it's beautiful !
this is the best .
i like it out here .
this is spirit river !
get you out of the doctor's office , dano .
it's good to be outside .
yeah .
get you away from that computer , jer !
what kind of fish are those?
that's brown trout .
that's big .
brown trout?
hey , look , a deer !
it's cool .
right out there in the open .
hey ...
cheers .
the great outdoors !
tom !
you guys are spraying me !
give me a break ,
i'm writing your name !
stop it !
hey , don't , don't , don't !
what , are you gonna melt?
no , but this water is teeming with microbes .
they don't bring losers to the swag pot !
so this is spirit river .
we take that to widowmaker bend .
and then we hike the devil's staircase , and that should lead us to the top of hellfire ridge .
what's with all these satanic names?
isn't there , like , a fluffy bunny way?
no , but there's a shut up you big baby ridge .
okay , just keep your eyes open
for our first day's marker .
what's that?
it's a rock formation called grandpa's nose .
grandpa's nose .
looking for grandpa's nose .
i think i see it !
it's right there .
good work , dan .
prepare to port .
i'm gonna drink some beer !
i predict you'll be puking in that river before the end of the night , tom .
dry timber ...
hi there , coalminer's daughter .
you want a hand?
or you can always try these fancy new things called " matches .
i saw how to do this on the discovery channel .
okay?
and i'm gonna do it .
i got it covered .
oxygen in there ...
get that right combination ...
stop , drop and roll !
why would you do that? !
i'm with my face right next to the ...
and you blow ...
why would you do that? !
it's warm .
it's a nice fire .
hey .
we did it .
i told you .
do you really wanna hurt me?
do you really wanna hear this crap?
please .
you liked this song just as much as i did .
when we were kids , it didn't matter what the song was .
we weren't wrapped up in what was cool and uncool .
we just listened to the music .
it should be like that now .
just listen to the song , man .
this song is so uncool .
well , i like it .
it soothes me .
dan , what is wrong with you?
i'm blessed with good taste .
one day , you'll see , i've always been correct .
don't get cocky , 30 year old dr. mott , with 46 years of school under his belt .
excuse me for getting an md and starting a successful practice .
excuse me .
i found a way to make 12 grand a month without having an md .
really?
how do you do that?
you running immigrants over the border again , coyote?
those guys fell asleep in my truck .
i thought i'd just gotten shitfaced and bought a bunch of sombreros .
i didn't know there were dudes underneath .
for real , though?
selling harleys .
it's the greatest gig on the planet .
congrats .
i'm happy for you .
seriously , though , you guys both sound
like you're doing great .
aren't you?
i just don't know if i'm cut out for the whole family wife kids thing .
i would kill to have a woman at home willing to have sex with me every night .
at work , i just sit in my office and i think ,
there's gotta be something better out there . " you know what i mean?
i thought you liked your job .
i like to surf .
sitting out in the water .
waiting for that perfect wave .
and i also like being out here .
i like this , right now .
the first time in months , no worries , no responsibilities .
just living in the moment .
just like billy did .
hey .
here's to billy .
to our dead friend .
get them up .
tom ...
dano , whatever happened between you and cockeyed katie , anyway?
you know , i don't appreciate the name calling .
katie was very attractive .
it was a mutual separation .
yeah , between her eyes .
that girl had not one , but two wandering eyes .
it was like her eyes were trying to escape from her head .
you know , tom , i'm sorry she wasn't up to your high standard of women .
no tattoos below the waist , never worked as a carny .
name one girlfriend of mine who worked as a carny .
jo jo , the one who had her downstairs pierced .
oh , jo jo .
that's one .
how do you know what she did with her downstairs?
jojosdownstairs .
com .
that was a good one .
hey , dano , let's see what you packed us for dinner .
what is this , astronaut food?
no .
it's a vitamin gel pack .
it tastes like watermelon .
it's very filling and it preserves well for camping .
i'm not an astronaut .
i'm an american .
and there's fresh salmon in that river for the taking .
what?
i'm eating salmon tonight .
that's great , except we didn't bring any fishing gear .
don't need any .
we'll shine them .
that would kill a fish .
shine the fish , old cherokee trick .
i forgot the cherokee had been using the flashlight for thousands of years .
no , didn't they pioneer the d battery?
all right , suckers .
let's see who's eating salmon tonight and who's eating crow .
do you have a crow catching trick?
yuk it up , astronauts .
they love figure eights .
hey , 100 grand and my left nut says the only thing you catch out there is a cold .
got it !
grab it !
what are you doing? !
fantastic .
can you do that again?
you owe me 100 grand and the left nut .
are you gonna catch it when i throw it up?
yeah , yeah !
yeah , yeah , come on !
i'm gonna have to use a distinct pattern now .
they got used to the figure eight .
it's gonna be tough , but i'll focus .
what the hell are you doing?
i toss it , you grab it .
that's your part of the deal .
what?
what are you doing?
i'm taking off my shoes .
why?
because i run faster with no shoes .
you can't outrun that bear .
i don't have to outrun the bear .
i just have to outrun you .
stay calm .
it's important that you don't let them smell your fear .
just follow my lead .
what are you gonna do?
it's a bear !
we're all gonna die !
run !
keep going !
get out !
go away !
go !
get out !
stay calm .
get in the fetal position .
oh , god .
it won't bother you if you're in the fetal position .
nothing's gonna happen now .
is he gone?
is he gone?
abort the fetal position !
it's not working !
it's not working !
run !
no ...
the bear thinks dan's her cub .
what do we do now?
stay ...
stay down .
don't make eye contact .
help me !
let's go .
this is bad .
this is really bad .
do something .
go first .
no , you go first .
hey .
where's the bear?
he's trying to fatten dan up so they can hibernate together .
chew it up and eat it .
eat it .
stop pretending .
dan , you have to eat it .
you have to actually eat it .
okay .
bite .
eat it .
it's delicious .
very good , thank you .
is there another one?
that was good .
that was real good .
let's go .
okay .
move , move , move .
up the tree .
your mom misses you .
she's in my stuff .
hey , that's my phone .
she ate my phone .
how long do you think she'll keep looking for me?
hour , hour and a half , tops .
bears have very short attention spans .
i know a guy who trains them .
what was that?
i don't know , but it scared away our friend .
let's get out of here .
what do you think could happen if this thing went off right in the boat?
you think we'd die?
i think you throw it right now .
what if i toss it to you and then you throw it?
elwood , throw it !
cue the insane hillbillies .
what are these freaks doing?
they're fishing .
why aren't they using their flashlights , tom?
this is exactly what you hear about when people go into the deep woods in the middle of summertime .
aside from getting all sorts of diseases and things , they just wind up being the victims of some kind of unexpected man rape .
how you like me now , boy?
i don't like this ...
quiet .
go , go .
she ate everything .
including my very expensive cell phone .
all right , let's load up .
there's treasure in them hills .
wait a minute , you're not actually considering continuing , are you?
why not?
well , because i just ...
i got carried away by a bear .
and then we spent the night sleeping in a tree .
well , we got that out of the way .
now we can get back on the river .
there comes a time in every cub's life when he needs to strike out and make it on his own .
fine .
fine .
but i say we avoid them and we launch around the bend there , okay?
all right , all right .
heave ho .
they call this portage .
or portage .
what's the map say , jerry?
you know , it's a map .
it's gonna be ...
it's gonna be good .
jer , isn't the river supposed to fork?
no .
it just goes straight the whole way .
straight shot .
are you sure?
we are back in business , boys .
all right .
let's rudder back .
bring the tail out .
it's getting kind of rough , tom .
not bad , i've been in much worse .
really?
not a good time to read a map , jer .
guys , i wanna pull over .
i need to take some dramamine ...
i got the stern .
work the bow , work the bow , jer .
guys , let's pull over .
this is exactly what you'd expect .
we're doing great .
tom , guide us to the bank .

i'm not having the fun you promised me !

terrible !
same stroke , same stroke !
tom?
yes?
it's getting big .

raging waters?
yeah .
they had some serious rapids there , man .
what , class " toddler "?
hey , i was employee of the month at the monsoon lagoon .
i knew you were lying .
great .
oh , you did?
i knew it .
well , you're the reason that we had to launch the boat in the wrong part of the river .
hey , i am not the navigator map guy .
okay , jerry , didn't you see on the map that the river split?
i would've , if your friend , the big ass bear , didn't eat the map .
hold on a sec .
tom?
were you really employee of the month?
no .
i lied about that too .
i must have been crazy .
i ...
all right .
this trip is officially over .
this is finished !
let's ...
let's just go home .
i agree .
that's a great decision .
all we gotta do is jump up over that 100 foot waterfall , swim upstream 20 miles , get the sheriff on the phone ...
he liked us , i remember .
and he'll send out a rescue boat .
and ...
hey , there's a beer in the river .
cool .
look at this , it's cold .
we are in serious trouble , my friends .
all data points to us being ...
how do you humans say it?
completely screwed?
yeah .
you know , that is ...
that's a good way to say it .
i mean , it pretty much sums it up .
i suspect tom is drunk .
i didn't wanna say anything ,
because he's such a live wire ...
you guys , we're fine .
we got the compass .
i've got billy's compass !
look , that's east , west , north .
that's south .
that's south !
that's south !
that's great !
what?
sorry .
it only works with the map .
so you're saying you lost the map?
you don't have it?
no .
i'm saying i forgot to hold on to it while my ass was free falling over a 100 foot waterfall .
so you don't have it?
hey , do you hear that?
oh , hell , yeah .
hey , that sounds like creed .
i never thought i'd be happy to hear anything that sounds like creed .
lights .
thank you , god .
civilization .
look at that .
they have a fire .
you think they're cooking food?
i hope so .
i am starving .
damn it , elwood .
this blade is dull .
ain't my fault .
see how i popped off that fish head?
what is it?
i told you not to use my buck knife .
how you like me now , fish?
you ain't so tough without a head , huh?
oh , what's that?
you can't hear me?
that's right , because you don't have ears , because you don't have a head , because i cut it off !
okay , that's ...
i mean , that's a little weird , right?
we should get out of here .
listen , i say we just try talking ...
shut it .
the hell was that?
is that a gun?
that's a gun .
must've been a possum .
boll weevil .
guns and fish heads ...
it's okay , dano , relax .
we'll just lay low .
we'll get out of here in a second .
hey .
yeah?
these guys are pot farmers .
what?
how do you know that?
oh , boy .
we should go .
lynyrd .
skynyrd .
come here .
there you go , spoiling them dogs .
lots of vitamins in these fish heads .
look at that .
skynyrd likes fish heads almost as much as you do .
do you think they saw us?
no , i don't .
what are you doing?
what?
i'll write you a prescription .
let's go .
come on .
all right .
on my go .
ready?
go , go , back here .
come on .
hey , guys .
listen .
we don't want any trouble .
we just got lost on the river , you know?
hey , can we use your phone?
oh , of course .
and ...
who cares , you know?
let's go through there .
where?
there's no door .
lynyrd , skynyrd .
get them .
come on , dano .
good work , buddy .
thanks .
let's go .
come on , dano .

i can't see nothing through this smoke !
we're dead .
we're dead .
we're dead .
we're dead !
they're gonna ...
they're gonna ...
we're gonna die ...
you set the security flares too close , elwood .
the whole damn field's on fire .
where the hell are the damn dogs? !
you guys gotta promise me that you'll never tell my patients that i got stoned , because if they found out i got stoned , they'll think that i'm a stoner .
the next thing you know , i won't have a license anymore .
they'll take away all my instruments and my coat and my office , and i won't have a parking space anymore .
i just don't wanna lose all my stuff .
i lost my legs ...
oh , great .
we got us a couple of weed freaks .
the hell are they looking at?
get up , you stoner dogs !
get up .
you gotta move your legs .
move your legs .
i think i see them .
they got laser scopes .
they had you pinned .
dudes .
dudes , dudes .
seriously .
seriously .
i will give you four cows for denise's hand in marriage .
i'll give them something to laugh about .
matrix .
my back .
cut them off at the river .
jerry , jerry .
billy .
jesus , billy .
i miss you .
you gonna find d. b. 's treasure?
i'm just trying to make it out of here alive .
don't give up .
keep looking .
hey , is it cool to be a grown up?
not really , my man .
stop .
stop .
you're gonna run into ...
we can't outrun them .
we gotta hide .
quick , hide .
how?
how?
let's get them !
man , our whole crop is burning !
those assholes are dead !
and the bodies that are attached to them are dead too !
dead !
d e a d !
dead !
assholes !
a s s h o ...
stop spelling !
come on , you're dead !
we're gonna get you !
you can only run so far !
and you can never hide !
bullfrogs .
i hate bullfrogs .
they're nasty .
don't waste the ammo .
come on , they must've headed up towards the river .
it crawled straight in my stomach .
let's go .
i think it laid eggs in my stomach .
you think they're still following us?
i don't wanna stop and find out .
just keep going .
it's not all burnt .
i think we're gonna be okay .
you think?
yeah .
you think?
yeah .
damn it .
it's all burnt .
i knew it , dennis .
it's all burnt .
every bit .
they burned it .
oh , yeah .
it's all burnt .
the whole damn field is burnt .
but we got a bigger problem , elwood !
we got three bona fide yuppies out there ,
lost somewhere , and we gotta track them .
we gotta catch them and we gotta kill them .
i think we can slow down .
i haven't heard dogs or guns for hours .
yeah?
you slow down , get a stick of dynamite up your ass .
calm down , daniel , we're gonna be all right .
no , we're not , jerry .
we could really die out here .
man , i can't believe that i would listen to you guys .
let's go take billy's trip .
let's ...
let's find d. b. 's treasure .
i'll get a canoe .
i'll get some rope .
is he all right?
" it'll be great .
" we'll find d. b. 's treasure ! " right .
is he having a panic attack?
i don't know .
that's great .
make jokes .
that's a really good idea .
is this living in the moment enough for you , jerry?
is this the carefree life with no responsibility that you wanted?
is this the ...?
is this the great wilderness adventure that you were dreaming of?
how should i be , dr. dan?
tell me .
be afraid .
i am afraid .
well , then , act like it !
it is very confusing to people in your life when you don't act the way that you're feeling !
no wonder denise is fed up with you .
what did you say?
don't you step to me .
put your hands down .
you take it easy .
mr. joe tattoo , mr. motorcycle man , mr. super cool , mr. bullet wound ...
oh , my ...
tom , you got shot .
oh , cool .
he got shot?
yeah .
come here .
are you all right?
you could lose a roll of pennies in that thing .
look at how deep it is .
it just grazed you .
you're really lucky .
oh , wow , that's gonna be a great scar .
i'm gonna stitch it up good .
lose the cleaver .
meat cleaver's my favorite .
it's scary , but ultimately ineffective .
lose it .
now , dennis , you don't understand ...
them three boys get back to town , you're gonna spend the next 40 years in the can getting manhandled .
quit messing around .
lose the cleaver .
i love the cleaver .
you'll be good as new .
sorry .
hey , dano .
i'm sorry i got you into this .
i really am .
jerry , i wanted to come .
well , we're getting out of it .
i promise .
and when we do , someone's buying the first round .
not it .
not it .
tom , i think you're buying with all that ...
all that harley money .
oh , god , it's making me sick .
i'm sorry , i ...
that whole thing was an exaggeration .
what , you don't make that much?
no , i don't sell harleys .
in fact , the only thing i've sold lately is some clothes and cds .
they weren't even mine .
tom , that's not an exaggeration , that's a lie .
you know , you lie a lot .
i know .
what happened?
well , first it was blackjack .
then the cards went south .
so then i started betting football and baseball .
i lost everything .
what'd i expect?
i got no luck , jerry .
it's like my old man used to say , " family curse .
if we didn't have bad luck , we wouldn't have luck at all .
you have got to stop blaming your old man .
i'm not blaming anyone .
yeah , you are .
listen to yourself .
the family curse .
yeah , it's real .
i'm a great gambler .
your dad was a piece of work .
i mean , he had his own things going on .
but if he did one thing right , it was not raising a complete idiot .
you're not him , tommy .
you're a lot smarter , for one thing .
right , dano?
well , i wouldn't say a lot smarter .
tom , you have a lot more going for you than you think you do .
that's easy for you to say , dano .
you're a freaking doctor .
i mean , you got a big old bank account , a ginormous house ,
big , thick red hair ...
you know what?
i wouldn't be so jealous of me if i were you .
every day i develop some new and exciting phobia .
you're exaggerating again .
i'm afraid of the dark , jerry .
so?
there's a lot of people that are afraid of the dark .
i know a shitload .
i'm afraid of small spaces .
again , not that abnormal .
cellophane .
like saran wrap?
yeah .
yeah , you're alone on that one .
see , i won't even keep it in the house anymore , because i'm afraid somehow it'll get , like , draped over my head and stick to my mouth and nose and i'll ...
i'll suffocate .
how pathetic is that?
very .
relax , you're almost through .
there you go .
hey , would one of you guys grab my ...?
phone .
my ...
that's a phone .
it's that way .
phone !
how did your phone get all the way up here?
who cares?
that last thing i remember , it was ...
go , go , go !
that bear loves you , dano !
whiskey dick , this is lightning company .
come in , whiskey dick .
we are on the move and loaded for bear .
come back , come back ...
why'd you stop?
right there .
footprints .
oh , it's theirs .
it's weird .
footprints with no people in them .
i mean ... ... it's like it's them , but it's not them , you know what i mean?
rarely .
get on your wheeler .
hold on a second , guys .
you know what we should do?
we're gonna climb the tree .
we'll climb the tree , get a good look at the land , maybe we'll see a road or a way out of here .
yeah , i'll go .
give me a boost .
oh , hey , tom , wait .
you can use these .
thanks .
please , just be careful .
are you maintaining a safe distance back there?
yeah , two second rule , i know .
do you see anything?
hey , guys !
this is really cool !
what is he doing up there?
tommy , you see a road?
any signs of life?
are you kidding me?
tommy?
tom , do you see anything or not?
i think i might still be stoned .
hello?
excuse me , miss?
ladies?
my name is flower !
you may call me butterfly .
and if you're from the logging company , you'll have to speak to our lawyers .
if you look to your left , you can totally see her downstairs .
what?
we're not ...
we're not from the logging company .
peace .
peace .
hey , peace .
peace .
what's your name?
jerry .
jerry conlaine .
and what's your forest name?
slug .
his forest name is slug .
i got you .
thanks , tom , thanks a lot .
i'm sorry , slug .
we can't abandon our post .
do you understand?
well , could we come up there , then?
please?
come on up .
so then we run straight into this freezing , like , water pond .
we had to hide underwater , but we used these reeds .
reeds?
like pussy willow reeds?
really?
god , it must've been so hard to breathe .
yeah , it's been quite a trip .
do you guys have a cell phone that we could use?
sorry , slug .
cell phones are bad for the environment and people who live in the environment .
right .
you poor boys .
you need to get out of those damp , dirty clothes .
here , let us wash them for you .
no , no .
i'm fine .
let us nurture you .
oh , boy !
mighty oak could go for some nurturing .
stay right there .
no .
it's ...
just relax , condor .
no , it's okay , honestly .
i'm actually not really into being touched .
i'm a doctor , so i usually do the touching .
yeah .
i've been told i give a very good calf massage .
if you wanna roll down those stockings , i could give you one .
stockings?
leg warmers?
i'm all natural .
supernatural .
you guys live up here year round?
we've been here 287 beautiful days .
how do you guys get supplies?
when we need supplies , we radio the earth child support network .
radio?
you ...
you guys have a radio?
yeah .
we haven't used it since that last big thunderstorm .
remember that , flower?
oh , my god .
that thunderstorm was so spiritual .
earth child's limbs were just waving , heaving back and forth ,
like she was dancing in the rhythm to the thunder .
it was just like ...
full on tantric orgasm .
so where's this radio?
tree had an orgasm?
you don't say .
we danced naked in the storm all night .
and then held each other , soaking wet , until the morning .
the rain is like a drug .
it just makes you wanna ...
what?
makes you wanna what?
can we please use the radio?
sure thing , slug .
wow .
monkey feet .
yeah .
it's like a second pair of hands .
hello?
anyone out there?
my name's jerry conlaine , and my two friends and i are lost in the woods .
hello?
you gotta say " over . " over .
i read you , son .
this is breaker station 22 .
what is your position?
over .
see?
he said , " over .
we are two miles east of harold's bluff in a giant redwood called earth child .
over .
in a tree .
we'll find you .
we will give assistance and whatnot .
peace .
over .
you just sit tight .
we're coming to get you .
over and out !
so we ran out of food in borneo , so we just ended up eating our mosquito netting .
just salted it up , and it was good .
it was really good .
oh , you messy thing .
let me get that .
thank you .
well , there's plenty more grubs here , condor .
oh , no , i couldn't .
that bark shot right through me .
i need to visit the little trees 'room .
where do you guys do the do?
top side of the tree .
got a real kick to it .
bag it when you're done .
put it in the basket up top .
if you bring it in , you take it out .
right?
okay , will do .
do you have any paper?
oh , great .
you know ,
i think i'm gonna wait until we get to the ranger station .
someone's here , someone's here .
good afternoon , ladies .
nice looking tree .
end of the line , boys .
come on down .
they're gonna kill earth child .
no !
no , they're not gonna kill earth child .
they're after us .
we gotta get down and we gotta make a run for it , all right?
no !
no !
go to it , elwood .
we're gonna die up here in this stupid tree .
you know , condor , even if your bodily death is extraordinarily painful ,
your soul will live on .
everything happens for a reason .
listen up , karma chameleons .
nobody's dying .
here's the plan .
send those boys down , pretty little birdies .
i'm gonna rappel down .
and then i'm gonna secure the rope and then i'm gonna distract them .
you two slide down after me .
all right?
okay .
stop it !
cut it down , elwood .
good plan , jerry .
one small change .
time to find out whether i have the family curse or not .
for me , jer , for me?
yeah , go , go , go .
give them hell , tommy .
this hell mart's open for business , and i'm slashing prices .
stop !
come on , boys , don't be afraid .
we gotta cover him .
i have an idea .
you just send those boys down .
there won't be no more trouble for you , earth mama .
heavier than it looks .
oh , good idea .
oh , yeah .
you've got it .
ready?
you got it .
oh yes .
i'm hit .
i'm hit .
it's doody , dennis .
one , two , three .
oh , shit .
dano , let's go .
get away from my tree !
this is wrong .
okay .
i can't do this , jerry .
okay .
jamming up my gun barrel .
this is not me .
you're a beautiful spirit .
fly free and know that love follows you .
thank you , kind , crazy , hairy lady of my dreams .
it was cute .
get off my tree !
shoot her .
filthy hippie !
shoot her again .
that is it !
i don't wanna do this , jerry .
remember when we used to jump off that railroad bridge into cedar lake?
that was higher than this .
no , no .
i never jumped off of there .
you guys always pushed me when i wasn't looking .
oh , yeah .
go !
hold on , dan .
i made it .
did i kill your grandma?
i don't think so .
where are they getting all this poo?
he's getting away on my wheeler !
get him , elwood .
i'm gonna shoot him !
come on , let's go .
get on , get on .
move , baby , move .
come on , jer .
go .
go .
hold on .
come on , dennis , we gotta move .
all right , i'm on .
go .
go .
hold on , dano .
can't this thing go any faster?
shoot the one driving !
what are you doing?
i'm pretending i'm on a speeder bike so i can block out reality .
it's my process .
leave me alone .
over there .
it looks like a clearing .
that way .
that way , that way , that way !
damn it , elwood .
i think i just swallowed my underpants .
shoot them .
i can't believe they survived that fall .
dennis , they're getting away .
no , they're trapped like rats .
only way they can go now is up the mountain .
we know right where they're headed .
let's go .
flat tire .
damn it , tom .
keep moving .
getting close , elwood .
this way .
all right , that is it .
i'm out .
i'm out .
i'm out .
i have spent the last , like , two hours within sniffing distance of a sweaty ball sack and a sweaty ball sack , and i am out .
i'm out .
what does that mean?
i think it means he's out .
like , coming out .
like , he's finally admitted he's gay .
you know , i'm just gonna stay here until help comes .
i mean , this is serious .
i lost my inhaler .
i've known you almost , what , 25 years now?
i've never seen you have even a hint of asthma , anything .
that's because i have the inhaler , jerry .
no , i think jerry's right .
i think this whole thing's just in your head .
you just need to take a couple of real deep breaths and you'll get over it .
oh , okay , why didn't i think of that?
i'll just get over my chronic respiratory illness .
i'll just breathe .
there you go .
i'm over it .
see?
that wasn't that hard , was it?
you gotta relax , dano .
all right?
it's no time to give up hope .
let's just keep going .
no , actually , jerry , i'm convinced that this is the perfect time to give up hope .
i don't know that there has ever been a better time to give up hope .
i mean , look at this .
things are as bad as they could possibly get .
i stand corrected .
elwood , what are you doing?
it's raining .
it's raining .
tom , man , get under here .
you're gonna die of pneumonia .
no , but we will die of hypothermia .
look , our only chance is to huddle together .
we gotta huddle our bodies together for warmth .
i , for one , choose death .
interesting .
one minute you mock my sweaty ball sack , and now you wanna cuddle with it .
you know , the whole huddle up thing is the oldest trick in the book .
i've used it .
it's just for getting a girl naked .
worked , though .
every time .
this never leaves the cave .
i'm starting to feel warm .
see?
i told you guys .
let's just try and get some sleep .
hey , dano .
how hot were those chicks in the tree?
they were hairy , but hot .
the rain , dancing to the rhythm of the thunder , full on tantric orgasm , are you kidding me?
hey , didn't ...?
didn't she kiss you once?
it was nice .
oh , my god .
they are probably dancing naked right now .
dancing ...
soaking wet .
hey .
hey !
oh , my god , dano , how could you? !
it wasn't me , it was jerry .
jerry , why would you do that?
i'm sorry .
my bad .
i'm so sorry .
what happens in the cave , stays in the cave .
oh , my god .
that was your ...
come back to bed , you guys .
i'm freezing .
not till he puts jabba back in his hut .
freeze , perverts .
wait , wait , wait , just ...
please don't shoot us , okay?
this isn't what it looks like .
if you're gonna rape somebody , rape dano .
did i ask you to talk?
no .
come with me , or i'll shoot your testicles off and stuff them and mount them on my mantelpiece .
that's gonna be an ugly mantelpiece .
go on .
that's it , come on .
what is it?
cinnamon .
what the hell are you doing , collecting herbs for your goddamn herb garden?
well , all the twigs are broken .
they've been through here .
that they have .
nice place .
get along .
build this yourself?
open the door .
okay , i'm going .
that's it .
it's a lot warmer in here .
i think he's gonna try to cook us .
where you going?
oh , susanna
don't you cry for me
if you're gonna kill us , just do it already , okay?
i am sick of waiting to die .
okay .
was that reckless?
yes .
if i was gonna kill you , i would have done it outside .
thank you .
thank you .
i agree .
you're a very gracious man .
that's a good one .
yes , with a happy ending .
d. b.
what'd you call me?
d. b. the maps ...
you are , aren't you?
you're d. b. cooper .
no , i ain't d. b. cooper .
that's ancient history .
i tell you what's not ancient history , though .
it's three naked deviates on my mountain .
we were searching for d. b. and , yes , we're naked , and we're trespassing , but there's a perfectly good explanation .
first thing , i want you to put some clothes on .
and then i'd like to hear this story .
thank you .
oh , thank you .
more of your own homemade fashions?
i wouldn't mind wearing one of these deer pelts up there .
i'd get dressed faster if i was you because i've been alone in this cabin for 30 years .
oh , god .
okay .
they would've come in here to escape the rain .
they laid down right here , dennis .
right here .
lay down beside me .
in order to stalk your prey , you gotta go where they go and do what they do .
then a scuffle broke out , and there were some harsh words exchanged , and they beat that little one until he was limp .
elwood ,
i don't need to know what happened .
i just need to know which way they went .
up mountain .
all right , let's get back to the wheeler .
i know a shortcut around devil's staircase .
we can still beat them to the summit .
and then you , you scared us with your testicle mounting speech .
that just came right off the top of my head .
it was very scary .
it was creepy too .
may i ask you one question?
could you really see their downstairs?
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
you could see everything .
it was ...
it was quite a view .
so , del , were you d. b. 's partner?
and his best friend too .
we've known each other ever since we were able to pee straight .
so ...
is he still alive?
hell , i don't know .
d. b. had this plan , see .
when he jumped out of the airplane , he was gonna land 3 degrees northwest of red devil ridge .
and he had a flashlight .
he was gonna signal me ,
i'd find him and then we were gonna work our way down to rio .
i love rio .
what ...?
what happened?
it snowed .
a blizzard .
you couldn't see anything .
you couldn't see your hand in front of your face .
hell , i don't know where he landed .
i looked for him for months and months .
so did the fbl , so did the cops .
no d. b. , no money .
but you could've left .
why'd you stay up here all these years?
seemed like a good idea at the time .
you know what i mean , kid?
yeah ,
i do .
have you ever spent 30 years in a cabin?
no .
then you don't know what i mean .
i mean , metaphorically , i know what you mean .
metaphorically , have you ever spent 30 years in a cabin?
ye ...
no .
well , then , think before you talk .
point is , i've spent the best years of my life sitting on the porch , playing the harmonica , waiting for something better , and the years have been going by faster and faster .
and then all of a sudden ,
i was an old man .
well , i bet you can play the shit out of that harmonica .
that i can .
except there's no one around to hear me play it .
you can lose your money , you can spend all of it , and if you work hard , you get it all back .
but if you waste your time , you're never gonna get it back .
whatever it is you fellas are looking for , you gotta go out and get it .
and you gotta go right now .
not right now , you idiots .
well , you boys get some sleep .
in the morning , i'm gonna point you in the right direction , get you right off this mountain .
morning .
bacon .
squirrel .
squirrel .

dy no mite .
dy no mite .
creeping me out .
look at this .
does a bear shit in the woods?
hey .
does a bear shit in the woods?
my cell phone .
where did you find that?
does a bear shit in the woods?
usually .
unbelievable .
i gotta make a quick call , all right?
who you gonna call?
ghostbusters?
denise .
hi .
jerry and denise are no longer doing it .
if you need denise , call her on her cell .
it's killing time !
come on , jerry , get down .
hey , come on , now .
give me a hand .
every time i get comfortable .
listen up .
go due north till you get to the top of the ridge , then you go directly west .
okay .
just keep going , you'll come to an old mining trail .
follow that right down to the bottom of the mountain .
all right .
you go right , i go left .
okay .
i love this part .
come on , he say left or right?
have a good life , boys .
let's go .
go , go , go !
when you peckerwoods get your diapers clean , come on back .
i'll be waiting .
west is this way .
we're not going west .
yes , we are .
the compass says so .
the compass came out of a cereal box , so why are we running the wrong way?
iron .
iron .
what?
iron ore .
there's iron in the hills .
it's throwing off the magnet .
tell mr. wizard that we're still going the wrong way .
which means del's compass , it wouldn't work here .
if d. b. was supposed to land 3 degrees northwest of devil's ridge , it would've come off as directly west .
who cares about d. b.
which means he would've landed somewhere ...
oh , my throat , neck , chest .
guys , i think we found him .
jesus .
this is him .
this is d. b. cooper .
it has to be .
the parachute and the briefcase .
he must have broke his legs in the landing and then stumbled in this hole .
you poor bastard .
del was looking for him , but it was winter .
and the snow must have covered up the top there .
we found him .
that's him .
i can't believe we did it .
d. b. cooper .
who else would it be?
this case is empty .
the money's gone .
no , look .
look what he's holding .
he burnt the cash to stay warm .
he traded every dollar for just a few more hours of life .
so much for the treasure .
no , that's it .
being alive , that's the treasure .
here he is , boys , the great d. b. cooper and his treasure .
and we found it , so we get our most valuable possessions back .
yeah .
gentlemen .
time to leave this stuff behind and get the hell home .
come on , elwood .
well , boss .
what's the plan now?
first we gotta find our way out of this hellhole ,
and then we make a run for it .
no .
no more running .
after everything we've been through ,
dr. mott has finally run out of things to be afraid of .
do you hear that?
i'm not scared of you , you neanderthal dicks !
okay , okay .
we got it , we got it , all right?
hey , look , there's light coming from over there .
what is that , a tunnel?
maybe it leads out of here .
we're never getting through there ... ... tom .
dano?
no .
no .
no way .
what happened to the badass over there?
what happened to running out of things to be afraid of?
that was ...
this is just a small , dark space .
i can't , i can't , it's a deal breaker .
this could lead out of here .
dan , you're the only one small enough to go through .
that's what she said .
it's ...
it's a mine shaft .
they had to get the ore out somehow .
it's our only chance , dano .
come on , prairie dog .
you can do it .
i don't think that's helping .
okay .
come on .
let's get him like this and slide him in .
keep going , buddy .
keep going .
there's gotta be light .
do you see light?
i don't think i can .
i don't think i can .
come on , dan .
soothing songs from the past .
do you really wanna hurt me?
do you really wanna make me cry?
precious kisses , words that burn me
lovers never ask you why
do you really wanna hurt me?
come on , dano !
do you really wanna make me cry?
quiet .
precious kisses , words that burn me
lovers never ask you why
the hills have gone gay .
no , no .
it's culture club .
do you really wanna make me cry?
i had a new wave phase .
precious kisses , words that love me
lovers never ask you why
do you really wanna hurt me?
hurt me
do you really want to make me cry?
yes , we really wanna hurt you
yes , we really wanna make you cry
precious kisses , words that burn me
lovers never ask you ...
how you like me now?
well , well , well .

i think this is just a misunderstanding .
that was quite a run you gave us .
you ain't running nowhere now .
what am i doing?
the game's up .
hold on , dennis .
i have a wonderful idea .
can i use this , please?
elwood , that is the best idea you have had , ever .

we were scared you was never gonna come .
oh , i scared you , did i?
i scared you?
yeah , you did .
it's all about you , isn't it , elwood?
these boys have been running all over .
well , it's a damn good thing i got here .
you two been shooting up this goddamn mountain for three days , chasing these jag offs .
nice racket , sheriff .
what , do you get a cut of the weed profits?
profits?
they work for me , ass wipe .
what are you gonna tell our families?
you can't exactly explain this away .
explaining?
we don't have to explain anything .
it's just three more city boys got lost on the river , that's all .
hey , i bet they got eaten up by scavengers .
it's a terrible shame .
dano .
case closed .
let's shoot them .
i wanna shoot the little redhead one right there .
now , look , i'm tired of talking .
let's get this done with .
over the edge you go , boys .
wait !
shut up .
wait , sheriff .
wait , wait , wait .
sheriff , i'm gonna shoot them now .
no , no , let's listen to this .
look , you and i , we're cut from the same cloth .
i mean , we're a lot alike , don't you think?
yeah , sure , i'm better with numbers and i bathe often .
i have a dental plan that allows me to keep all my teeth , unlike yourself .
yeah?
i learned a little something the last couple days , getting chased by ass face and dick chin there .
and that is ...
i have two of the best friends anyone could ever ask for .
i've got the love of a good woman .
i've got a really good life .
i mean , i've got an amazing life .
and i've decided that my life's worth living .
now , you have to decide if your life's worth living too , because if it is , you put your gun down .
and if we don't?
bye , bye , boys .
it's go time .
do this to him .
put the pin back in the grenade .
that is my grenade , sir .
the plan was for me to sacrifice myself if need be while you two ran for it .
i didn't know .
my grenade ...
i'm not a mind reader , jerry .
give me back my grenade .
run !
it's gonna blow !
all right , that's it .
you're dead .
when all this is over , someone's buying the first round .
not it .
not it .
enough of this shit .
just shoot them .
do you think there's beer in heaven?
i was thinking about the bar in town .
let's get off this mountain .
all right .
these charges are " unsubstantuated " and " injustifigurable " and ...
that's right .
we did it .
how you like me now?
this is the scene here at police headquarters as three local heroes emerge to a cheering crowd .
the men accidentally helped break up one of the biggest drug rings in state history while hiking in a remote section of the cascades .
my old man would not believe this .
billy wouldn't believe it .
actually , know what?
i think he would .
oh , my goodness .
look at this ensemble .
i like it .
look at you .
thank you , boys .
look at this stud .
del !
no names .
fuzz .
glad i caught you guys before you headed out .
i got something for you .
what's this?
d. b. 's parachute .
are you sure?
damn sure .
there's a little something for you rolled up inside there too .
thank you .
so where you headed?
thought i'd see the world .
i might even hit washington .
wow .
one state over .
till i do , i'm just telling tall tales .
remember , carry your friends wherever you go .
close to your heart .
or on your back .
i got d. b. 's bones in my satchel .
thought i'd give him a proper burial .
i spent 30 years waiting to have a life .
what the hell ...?
oh , my gosh .
oh , my god .
d. b. didn't burn it all .
he couldn't .
it was del's share .
there's gotta be 100 grand in here .
we'll split it three ways .
one third , one third , one third?
you know what?
no , thanks .
i'm ...
i'm good .
i'm not good .
you guys split it .
you wanna split it?
fifty fifty?
actually , i can't .
because i bet you 100 grand that you couldn't catch a salmon with a flashlight and i lost .
besides , tom , you got bills to pay .
you got a new life to start .
i don't know what to say .
just say we're square .
no , actually , we're not square .
i seem to recall a certain part of that wager being one left nut , and i'm gonna get it .
come on , pleated pants , let's go .
hey , tom .
hey .
hey .
oh , no .
don't make me go in through the throat .
i'm going through the throat .
you said i could keep it .
no , i didn't .
tom , you said i could keep it .
jerry !
officer !
hi .
this is jerry , and i can't come to the phone right now , because i am busy trying to convince the love of my life to give me another chance .
and i will prove to her that i grew up just enough to know that i want the responsibility , day in and day out , of being there for her in this relationship , which i am hoping will someday become marriage and kids and a long and unbelievably happy life together .
hi , honey .
so happy right now .
that was really , really beautiful .
will you get the light , hon?
oh , yeah .
you're so good at that now .
and then i jumped on the grenade to save my buddies and ...
blew my rib cage all to shit .
sent me 156 feet in the air .
then i went back and paid off all my debts in full with d. b. 's money .
one question .
what's a downstairs?
