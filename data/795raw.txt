just hypothetically .
marty , come on !
what would connecticut have to offer us?
lyme disease .
thank you , melman .

i'll need the rest of my voice for tomorrow .
it's seniors day , you know .
i have to roar extra loud .

what is it , melman?
okay , okay .
you know about the blood infection , and i have to get up every two hours .
well i got up to pee , and i looked over in marty's pen , which i usually don't do , i don't know why but i did , and this time i looked over ...
what melman , what's going on?
it's marty .
he's gone .
gone?
what do you mean , gone?
how long he has been working on this?
marty?
marty?
he wouldn't fit down there .
marty?
marty?
marty?

he wouldn't .
oh no !

we've got a lost zebra , probably on the way to connecticut by now , and we're gonna need ...
hello?
hello?
wait a second .
we can't call the people .
they'll be really mad !
they'll get marty transferred for good !
you don't bite the hand that feeds you .
i know that's right .
we gotta go after him .
go after him?
he's not thinking straight .
we gotta stop him from making the biggest mistake of his life !
he's probably out there lost and cold .
confused .
poor little guy .
melman , come on !
you know , maybe one of us should wait here , in case he comes back .
oh no , not now .
this is an intervention melman , we all gotta go !
what's the fastest way to grand central?
you should take lexington .
melman !
okay . we ..
we should take lexington .
what about park?
no , park goes two ways , you can't time the lights .
i heard tom wolfe is speaking at lincoln center .
well of course we're going to throw a poo at him !
i knew we should've taken park .
are you sure this is the fastest way to grand central station?
i don't know , that's what melman said !
hey you guys !
that room has some nifty little sinks you can wash up in , and look !
free mints !
this isn't a field trip , melman !
this is an urgent mission to save marty from throwing his life away !
now .. where's the train?
ah !

i asked you to talk to him !
i did ! i did !
i don't understand !
let's go !
what are you crazy?
i'm ten years old !
and then that he has black and white stripes ...
what you gotta do , is you go straight back down west 42nd .

the alex .
and this is gloria , marty and melman .
and just where are you giants from?
we're from new york and we ...
all hail the new york giants !
new york giants !
what are we doing , some sort of inbreeding program?
i say we just gotta ask these bozos where the people are .
excuse me , we bozos have the people of course .
hey , the bozos have the people !
oh .
well .
great !
good !
they're up there .
don't you love the people?
not a very lively bunch though .
so do you have any live people?
no .
only dead ones .
i mean if we had a lot alive people here , it wouldn't be called 'the wild ', would it?
the wild?
hold up there a second ... a fuzzbucket ...
you mean like the " living in mud hut , wipe yourself with leaf " type wild?
who wipes?
would you excuse me for a moment?
get me out of here !
we gotta get out of here !
alex !
help !
what are you doing?
i'm swimming back to new york !
i know my chances are slim , but i have to try !
you can't swim !
i said : " my chances are slim " !
nature !
it's all over me !
get it off !
i can't see !
i can't see !
i can see !
okay look , there's obviously just been a little mistake .
i'm sure the people didn't dump us here on purpose .
as soon as they realize what happened , they will come looking for us , right?
yeah , right .
you know something?
i bet they are already on their way .
2500 mlles south
well boys , it's gonna be ice cold sushi for breakfast .
rico !
well , since i'm doomed to die on this forsaken island ,
i , melman mankowitz being of sound mind and unsound body have divided my estate equally among the three of you .
oh , sorry alex .
hey !
a latrine .
nice work , melman .
outdoor plumbing .
no , it's not a latrine , it's a grave .
you sent melman to his grave , are you happy?
oh , come on .
this is not the end .
this is the whole new beginning !
this could be the best thing that's ever happened to us !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
this is not the best thing that's ever happened to us !
yeah !
you've abused the power of the birthday wish and brought this bad luck on all of us .
why did you tell your wish?
you're not supposed to do that !
wait a minute , i didn't want to tell you .
remember?
you guys made me tell you .
besides , this isn't bad luck , this is good luck .
look around .
there's no fences , no schedules , this place is beautiful !
ok !
ok !
i've had enough of this ...
this is your side of the island , and this is our side of the island .
that is the bad side where you can prance and skip around like a magical pixie horse .
and do whatever the hack you wanna do all day long .
and this , this is the good side of the island , for those who love new york and care about going home .
come on .
no , no .
back , back .
back !
you know what , this isn't good .
okay !
you all have your side , and i'll have mine .
and if you need me , i'll be over here .
on the fun side of the island .
having a good old time !
this is the fun side !
this is the fun side !
we're all gonna have a great time surviving until we go home !
i love this side !
this side is the best !
that side stinks !
you're on the jersey side of this cesspool !
well now what do we do?
don't worry melman i have a plan to get us rescued .
can't wait to see that look on marty's face when he sees this !
just look at him , he's helpless without us .
shut up , spalding !
i've been standing here for hours man !
how long do i have to pose like this?
she is finito !
i defy any rescue boat within a million miles to miss this baby !
when the moment is right , we will ignite the beacon of the liberty !
and be rescued from this awful nightmare !
what do you think?
pretty cool , ha?
how's the liberty fire going , melman?
great !
idiot .
i heard that .
why can't we just borrow some of marty's fire?
that's wild fire !
we're not using wild fire on lady liberty !
now rub , melman !
i've been doing , i can't !
i can't !
i can't do it !
i can't do it !
fire .

don't worry , cats always land on their ... face?
man , what kind of cat are you?
you maniac !

can we go to the fun side now?
everybody calm down !
come on .
into your chairs .
everybody please calm down .
you over here and you over there .

presenting your royal highness , the illustrious .. bla , bla .. you know .. etc . etc .
hurray , let's go .
now everybody !
we all have great curiosity about our guests .
the new york giants .
yes , willy .
i like them .
i like them , i like them .
i liked them first before i even met them i liked them .
yes , yes .
you have them compare to how much i like them .
ah shut up , you're so annoying !
now !
for as long as you can remember we have been attacked and eaten by the dreaded foosa .
the foosa !
the foosa are attacking !
to serve lemur
it's a good book !
please , please .
maurice .
shh !
quiet !
come on you all !
they ain't attacking us this very instant !
so my genious plan is this .
we will make the new york giants our friends .
and keep them close .
then with mr. alex protecting us , we will be safe and never have to worry about the dreaded foosa !
ever again !
i thought of that !
i thought of that !
yes !
me !
hold on , hold on everybody .
i'm just thinking now .
i mean does anyone wonder why the foosa was so scared of mr. alex?
i mean ...
maybe we should be scared too !
what if mr. alex is even worse than the foosa?
i'm telling you that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies .
maurice , you did not raise your hand .
therefore your heinous comment will be stricken from the record .
does anyone else have the heebiejeebies?
no !
good .
so shut up !
when the new york giants wake up , we will make sure , that they wake up in paradise .
now who'd like a cookie?
help
yo al ...
melman and gloria are over there having a good time .
there's room on the fun side for one more .
no thanks .
look , i've been thinking .
maybe if you give this place a chance i don't know .
you might even enjoy yourself .
marty , i'm tired .
i'm hungry .
i just wanna go home .
could you just give it a chance?
think about it .
it really isn't the fun side without you .
hell
no sollcitlng

who is it?
it's the pizza man .
who the hack do you think it is?
yes?

dilemma solved .
good night .

mr. alex was grooming his friend .
he's clearly a tender loving thing .
how can you have the heebiejeebies for mr. alex .
look at him .
he's so cute and plushy .
i don't think he was grooming him , julian .
looked more like he was tasting him to me .
suit yourself , no matter .
i don't care .
soon we will put my excellent plan to action .
all we have to do is wait until they're deep in their sleep .
how long is this going to take? !
antarctlca

wake up , mr. alex .
wake up , mr. alex .
rise and shining .
wakey , wakey mr. alex !

while you were asleep , we simply took you , to our little corner of heaven .
welcome to madagascar !
mada who ah?
what?
no , not who ah ... ascar .
marty .
it's ...
it's just like my mural , back at the zoo .
oh, no fellow .
that is the real deal right there .
i think that is not a bad view .
i mean that's the thing that you were always looking at , but it's actually there , that's like the real version of ...
how about once around the park?
let's get our blood pumping , get those lungs breathing at all this fresh air , who's with me?
ah , no .
i really i don't think i can .
you're it !
hey !

hey , stop that !
hey , you're crazy !
okay marty , i'm it .
i'm it , you win .
come on , alex .
get in the groove .
i haven't eaten in two days .
my blood sugar is real low .
i just don't have the energy .
i don't think that's your problem .
first of all that's not how you run in the wild .
let's go man !
put your rubber to the roll !
you just have to let up that inner lion !
now , who's the cat?
marty , i really don't ...
you are !
that's who !
come on , here we go !
that's it .
now let's build up some steam !
you're the cat .
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
i'm the cat !
surprise !
you're it !

cat's too quick .
i feel like a mile high pastrami on rye , on the fly from the deli in the sky !
let's go wild !

marty , marty , marty !
like you said baby , it's ...
crackalackin '!
ain't that right , melman !
oh , yeah !
yeah !
i'm in heaven !
you see , maurice alex is now a friend and the foosas are nowhere to be seen .
it could be said that my plan is working in a very good workin 'kind of way .
alex , you gotta try some of this !
i feel good !
i feel like a king again !
king?
yeah !
you should see his act !
come on alex , why don't you show him some of your act?
no , i really don't think i can ...
okay .
ladies and gentlemen , primates of all ages , the wild proudly presents the king !
alex the lion !
e flat , fellows !
yeah !
the king is in the house !
if he's a king , then where's his crown?
i've got the crown .
got the very nice one !
and it's still on my head !
look at it .

the roar man , the roar !

alex , what did you do?
he bit me on the butt !
no .
i didn't .
did i?
you kind of did .
you just bit me on the butt !
what a hack is wrong with you?
why did you bite me?
man , is because you are his dinner?
what?
excuse me?
that's dumb .
dumb , dumb , maurice .
what is the simple bite on the buttocks among friends?
here .. give me a nibble ..
the party is over , julian .
your brilliant plan has failed .
what are you talking about?
your friend here is what we call a deluxe model hunting and eating machine .
and he eats steak .
which is you .
get out of here .
okey dokey , maurice .
i admit it , the plan failed .
all is lost !
we're all doomed .
the foosas will come back and gobble us with their mouths !
because we are all steak .
i'm steak !
me , me , me , me !
mr. alex cannot stay here .
he belongs with his own kind .
on the foosa side of the island .
by the power invested in me , by the law of the jungle , bla , bla , bla , bla .
be gone !
what?
come on .
do i look like a steak to you?
yeah .
see , i told you i don't look like ...
wait , wait , what did you say?
oh , yeah !
he's going savage .
run for your lives !
marty , run !
a bull's eye .
excellent shot , maurice .
thank you .
marty?
i'm so sorry , marty .
what is wrong with me?
oh , no .
what have i done?
it's true .
i'm a monster .
i gotta get out of here .
foosa territory 1 mile
what have i done?
this is a nightmare !
it's all my fault .
now because of me we've lost alex .
what are we gonna do?
we're gonna find the way to help him , that's what we're gonna do .
come on , we are new yorkers , right?
we're tough .
we're gritty .
we're adoptable !
and we are not going to lay down like a bunch of melmans !
no , we're not .
oh, come ..

he was right behind us .
he went back for alex , he's gonna get himself killed .
boys , our monochromatic friend is in danger .
looks like we have a job to do .
embarking into hostile environment .
kowalski .
we'll need to win the hearts and the minds of the natives .
rico .
we'll need special tactical equipment .
we're gonna face extreme peril .
private probably won't survive .
alex , come on alex !
the boat's here , we can go home !
alex !

we can get out of here !
we can go back to civilisation and everything will be , just like it used to be !

we're a team , you and me , remember?
i don't wanna hurt you .

i have decided to thank you for bringing peace to our home .
and to make you feel good , i'm gonna give you this lovely parting gift .

maurice !
my arm is tired .

you just read my mind !
i was thinking , spain .
run with the bulls .
what about fiji?
cool !
canada , can we?
cheap meds .
you know , i wouldn't mind coming back here for a visit sometime .
yeah , i can do that .
you can say that again .
