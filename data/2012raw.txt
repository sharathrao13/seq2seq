here comes pippi longstocking , with a hey , and a skip ...
cut it out , mom .
did you ever sleep with ramon?
no , why are you asking me that?
how are molly and isak?
they're all right .
you know , ninni , i'm very ... ... very , very proud of you .
i wish i was more like you .
more like you ...
dogface !
dogface .
come here !
mom , isak took my game !
i had it first !
if you're going to fight , i'll take it .
isak is a jerk .
i'm not , you fucking idiot .
don't swear , isak .
buckle up .
but you and dad swear .
you can swear when you're adults too .
falllng beauty
after all , for the past ten years we've managed every payment .
only now when the wiring needed replacing ... ... and i've had less work than usual ...
perhaps you need to review your entire situation .
it would make more financial sense to have a smaller house .
maybe you should consider it .
our choice of home is ours , thanks .
it would be very good if you gave us this opportunity .
my suggestion is to grant you more time to pay your debts , until the 1st of august .
will you be able to manage that?
of course .
i want a zelda windwaker .
you can get a second hand one .
yeah , when all my friends don't play it anymore .
there they are . ... grateful to pay through the nose !
if you think you can act like that at a bank , you're dumber than i thought .
i'm telling you , we're not going to crawl in the dirt and die alive .
everybody fucking dies alive .
some people never start living .
complaining !
if you could just say something useful for once !
hi .
hello .
oh ...
hi !
hi there , ekborg .
hi there , bergendahl .
how are things?
okay ...
you're certainly hot right now .
sometimes it's up , sometimes it's down .
how about you?
the tv series went off the air , right?
that happened about a year ago .
things have been kind of ...
it'll be fine , but if you hear anything , give me a call .
of course .
you too .
we're having a midsummer party .
well , midsummer's kind of ...
lia's the one who knows about the holidays .
i'll call you .
take care !
say hi to lia .
i will .
oh , i'm sorry .
how are you doing , your family?
we're all fine .
good .
we'll be in touch .
fine " ...
fucking fine !
get in , we're going home now .
i'd like to take a picture .
please , ninni , take it today .
i'm not in the mood ...
how did it go?
absolutely great !
we have to pay the debt , or we're out on the street .
couldn't we sell our house and find a smaller place?
could you be quiet?
i want to have a hamburger .
not today .
why not?
we don't have money for burgers .
i want a hamburger !
hamburger , hamburger , hamburger ...
stop it , or i'll turn you into a hamburger !
slow down !
i'm not going fast .
we'll make hamburgers at home .
money's kind of tight right now .
homemade burgers suck .
i feel sick ...
would you slow down !
that's enough , isak .
your party's going to cost a lot .
it'll be fun for you too .
it's still true .
parties are better than regular days .
hamburger , hamburger , hamburger ...
shut up !
basta !
talk about typical midsummer weather !
that guy is going to stay in the hunting cabin near by your house .
why?
maybe he likes it when nothing much happens .
if you pick seven different kinds of flowers on midsummer eve , and put them under your pillow , you'll dream about your intended .
the person you're going to marry .
the love of your life .
i'm going to marry you , ninni .
we're going to be lesbians .
what?
the toilet's clogged .
the tank hasn't been emptied , has it?
so we'll use the outhouse .
the outhouse? !
this is a party !
everything will be fine .
everything will be fine , mom .
i'm sure it will .
i'm not going to move out of this house , you hear?
at least not until we get some decent tri chamber sewage put in .
oh , mom ...
little froggies , little froggies , they're comical to see
little froggies , little froggies they're comical to see
no ears , no ears , no tails 'a hanging free ...
eat , drink and be merry !
let's do " song of summer " !
ninni , that was the summer you were conceived ...
should anyone feel we've had enough to drink
anyone at the table who's had their fill ...
their singing makes me feel sick ...
who's that?
oh , right ...
that guy's staying at the cabin .
i gave him a lift .
he's never celebrated midsummer before , so i invited him to join us .
could everybody please listen?
where can ramon sit?
here .
what's his name again?
ramon .
some aquavit ...
take it easy .
hey , isak , shoot at the target and that's it .
point the gun at anyone else , and i'll take it away from you .
how are things with you and jorgen?
how should i put this ...
that old rose bush over there sees more action than mine .
no , things are kind of iffy .
ninni , how do you say " lagom " in english?
i don't know .
what about a new mortgage?
the bank turned us down .
so do some commercials .
i haven't exactly been turning down any kind of work for quite a while .
i'm sorry , but if we don't leave now , she just won't sleep .
bye !
it was a lovely party , really lovely .
mom?
hey , mom , why did you take off?
i was feeling sad .
yeah?
when i was your age , ninni ...
i thought ...
i thought things would ...
i figured someone would come along and make things right .
like when i was expecting you .
we had no place to live , and no money either .
christ , i was just a baby myself .
now ... everyone's become so boring .
they talk about boring things .
you're drunk , that's why you see things that way .
you're boring too .
oh , ninni , i didn't mean that .
i'm sorry , sweetheart .
no problem .
it's all right , mom .
i'll go back ...
i'll go back to the others soon .
you go ahead , honey .
promise me you'll be back?
i'm sorry i said those awful things last night .
no problem .
want me to help you clean up?
i'm going out for groceries , want to come along?
no ...
may i be excused?
that was way out of line .
what?
you know , doing that striptease .
what's the guy supposed to think?
that your wife is horny?
tiresome , you mean .
you wouldn't dare .
what do you mean?
rob a bank .
you want me to rob a bank?
actually , i do .
show you have the balls .
that would be nice .
anything ...
i would do anything .
don't wreck it !
it's my turn ...
hi , was the water nice?
yeah , it was great .
time to go ...
i saw you and ramon over by the tree .
i don't think he's ... the right kind of company for you .
don't tell me , tell him .
is he the right kind of company for you and mom?
what's up with you and him?
what do you mean?
welcome to the children's hotline .
hi , my name is ninni .
i'm 16 .
is there anything particular you'd like to talk about?
my parents are planning to do something illegal .
rob a bank , i think .
oh ...
are you sure?
many adults fantasize about things they wouldn't actually do .
they're kind of different .
well , if this is true ...
you aren't the right person to stop them .
then who is?
hi .
you just went to the bank .
this time we're seeing the top dog .
i don't need a baby sitter .
neither do i.
do i have a choice?
no .
all right , i'll baby sit .
the bank robbers take their own cars to the parking lot .
they switch to the getaway car .
and stop here , by the bank .
the alarm will go off .
and the police will come .
but since the robbers are so darn good ...
the police will stay on their tail .
no , they'll switch cars .
daddy showed me how to play cops and robbers .
how did it go?
we didn't get much .
see you .
that sure took a while !
where is ramon?
i dropped him off at his place .
we got stuck in a roadblock .
he'll be here for dinner .
what happened? !
they weren't looking for a car with a man and a woman in it .
just like we thought .
how did it feel?
let's go into the kitchen , molly .
what are they doing?
they're fighting ... maybe .
come on .
what happened at the bank?
we couldn't see the manager , so we'll have to go back .
shit , i've got to go to work .
i'll take you .
are you going to fight some more?
no , molly , we're not going to fight .
at least not for a while .
the food was great , thanks .
what are you doing?
it sounded like you were talking to someone .
i guess i was talking to myself .
you weren't smoking , were you?
no , dad .
now just go .
knock next time .
hi .
what's that?
a registered letter .
what does that mean?
your parents have to sign it .
how are you?
fine , how about you?
i don't know .
things are kind of weird .
hi .
see you .
see you .
bye .
bye , ninni .
jorgen .
well aren't you dressed up ...
i'm going to stockholm .
what?
tina and i are going to the amusement park .
you'll have to bring the kids along .
no way !
we're spending the night with a friend of tina's .
i won't do it .
we need a sitter , comprendes?
take care of your own kids , god damn it !
watch your language !
i'm not taking them along .
could i have a ride?
tina's already in stockholm .
bye !
how about a hamburger?
yes !
then you can tell me where that store with the video games is .
what are we waiting for?
let's go !
hi .
hi .
here's our receipt , we've paid the debt .
the sum total of 18, 730 kronor .
the works .
tutti frutti !
i'm sorry , but it's too late .
didn't you get my letter?
what ...?
we're foreclosing , you'll have to pay in full within 60 days .
i don't understand .
you told us the deadline was the first of august .
you didn't inform me at the time of your other outstanding debts .
may i ask where the money came from?
our friends lent it to us ...
does it matter?
it shows that your overall situation hasn't really improved .
first you tell us to pay what we owe .
then it's not good enough .
i'm sorry ...
now listen to me , you little cunt !
you aren't the least bit sorry !
i'd like you to leave .
shafting us turns you on .
know what , molly and isak?
you should be proud of your dad .
what are you doing?
we're going camping , remember?
we're going to do something together .
ramon's back , by the way .
he'll be going with us .
he's right behind you , mom .
hi .
go pack your things .
how are you doing , mom?
come on , everybody look this way ...
into the camera .
nice night .
yes , and the day was nice too .
i'll go read molly a bedtime story .
have you asked him?
no , not yet .
if you can't take the heat , stay out of the kitchen .
what was that?
quiet !
i heard everything you said .
like what?
i could hear everything .
have you had a bad dream?
i know what you're up to .
and i'm not going to accept it .
we haven't asked for your opinion , ninni .
this is totally crazy !
if you get caught , i'm the one who gets hurt .
along with molly and isak .
who says we'll get caught?
dad , you've always been there for me , don't change that .
everything we do , we do for you .
don't you know that?
when i was your age i'd moved from place to place with a lot of different jerks my mom met in lousy bars .
dad and i wanted you to have a place to call home .
but you're all so fucking spoiled and take things for granted .
damn it !
dad?
your mother and i made this decision together .
i'm going to call the cops .
go to bed .
he's going to back out of it .
we'll do it ourselves .
just the two of us .
we'll modify the plan .
forget it .
we're going away for a while .
ninni .
listen ...
i'm leaving .
i know ...
what the ...?
cool it .
it will be all right .
what time is it?
15 .
it's locked .
it will probably take the police in eskilstuna at least 20 minutes .
let's do it .
hi .
nice wig , what's up?
it's a practical joke .
a practical joke?
i'll tell you later .
somebody getting married?
no ...
i'll tell you later .
why the hell did you move the car?
because i had to !
step on it !
is that guy following us?
where?
that car?
i don't know .
there are two passengers ...
a guy and a kid .
gee , aren't we the lucky ones !
don't worry , i'll lose him .
i'll make a left turn here .
floor it !
he's gone .
really?
oh , christ !
shit , isn't that the car that was following us?
i don't know .
it could be ...
we've got to go .
we've got to leave .
christ , he is following us .
he's following us !
stop shouting !
calm down !
jorgen , this is a dead end !
stop shouting , damn it !
fucking lousy car ...
what's he doing now?
he's still right on our tail .
what a moron , chasing bank robbers with a kid in the car .
there are lots of morons around .
helena !
think he got our license plate no .?
probably .
what do we do now?
i've reported our car as stolen and i left it over at ramtorp .
the bag of money's up in that big oak tree over by the bend .
i think they were injured .
we've got to keep our mouths shut .
if we're arrested and the police say that one of us has confessed , they're lying .
in this country it's hard to convict anyone on circumstantial evidence .
especially people like us .
so , we have to shut up .
for the children's sake .
okay .
i'll get it .
hello?
no , she's not in .
i don't know when she'll be back .
bye .
ninni , call the police .
love , helena and jorgen
oh , ninni , you're so grown up .
we were in the neighborhood , so we dropped by .
hi , i'm lia .
this is a great place .
you're too late .
i mean , mom and dad ...
i don't know ...
i don't know when they'll be back .
has something happened?
is this a bad time?
probably .
i never lie .
then explain why the money was found up a tree in your yard?
i can't explain that .
can't you stay with someone?
like your grandparents?
my dad's mom is dead and ...
no , it's not possible .
i want us to be together .
i understand .
but isak and molly will have to stay at a care center at first .
that's the best i can do .
that's pretty .
you can have it .
thank you .
what's that?
bars .
jails aren't very pretty , so i added lots of flowers .
shut up , you idiot .
don't say that , isak .
somebody at the bank claims they recognized my voice from tv .
funny , isn't it?
not really .
no ...
well , it's not evidence .
time to go .
don't you want my drawing?
hi .
come on in .
how are you?
fine .
i've been thinking , you could stay here for a while .
but we only have one bedroom .
we can stay at the house .
the bank is selling it .
as of saturday .
didn't you know?
no .
there'll be some money from the sale , you could buy a new place .
i'll have to talk to the bank .
oh , honey ...
i'm sorry .
i'm going to go see mom in an hour or so , on top of it all .
i'll be back in an hour .
hello , ninni .
hello , mom .
i'm going to interview you .
why?
all right ...
listen , ninni ...
could you film the house before it's sold?
here comes pippi longstocking ...
cut it out , mom .
tell me what it was like growing up with my grandmother .
well , you know ...
drunks always tell lies .
they lie to themselves and to others .
they run out on you , they're not there for you .
why don't i ever get to see her?
i only remember meeting her twice , when i was just little kid .
we had a deal , she could only see you when she was sober .
see you later , alligator .
i didn't want you to be subjected to that kind of crap .
did you ever sleep with ramon?
no , why are you asking me that?
how are molly and isak?
they're doing all right .
you know what , ninni?
i'm very , very proud of you .
i wish i was a bit more like you ...
more like you .
we've got to go now .
no , you can't go !
we have to .
no !
i'm going with you .
i'm going try to bring you home .
promise?
yes , i promise .
now you come here and say you're going to be a big hero ...
do i even exist?
rosie ...
ramon told me he committed the robbery .
he wants to take the blame .
the police might not believe me , but if you tell them ...
listen , i saw helena downtown right before the robbery .
she was wearing a wig and waiting in a car i didn't recognize .
don't worry , i haven't told anyone .
you're talking about perjury .
he's going to leave the country .
there won't be a trial .
and you'll never see him again .
don't say that .
what a mess .
they're such fucking idiots .
okay .
but i'm doing it for you , and for molly and isak .
gracias .
goodbye .
hi , mom .
this is the last day , tomorrow the movers will be here .
you wanted me to film the house , and i wanted to say a few words too .
i won't tell dad about you and ramon .
i've been thinking about that , and about what you said about grandma ...
well , everything felt hopeless .
then i got angry .
how long do molly , isak , dad and i have to suffer because she drank?
isn't it about time you stopped feeling sorry for yourself?
cleaned up your own act?
mommy !
oh , molly ...
hi , isak !
hello there , big guy !
the house is great .
yes?
want to see my room?
i'd love to see it .
