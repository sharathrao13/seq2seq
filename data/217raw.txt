do you fancy a bite?
yeah .
all right .
hello , stranger !
said hello to lover boy yet?
iki , i'm in a hurry .
can we get on with it?
ruger mini 14 , 223 calibre .
it comes in a fetching chrome .
20 rounds per banana .
unless the elite and snazzy lki special takes your fancy , extending your capacity to 40 .
we've got a czechoslovakian ...
cz 83 , i'll take one .
oh ...
well , that's young felix's weapon of choice , isn't it?
now , there's a trip down memory lane .
i'm partial to a bit of sentiment , me .
i've heard things , you know .
he misses you .
so , what are you going to take?
i'll take the beretta , the cz , an ankle holster , add the mini 14 and i'm done .
i want to get in and out fast .
don't we all?
does durant still do his deals at the port hotel?
silly lad .
it'll be his undoing , one of these days .
but what do you expect from a fella who gets his arse waxed every month?
i forgot what a circus this place is .
funny , that .
i never did much like the circus .
all that poking your head in a lion's mouth shit .
bring on the horses !
get 'em rogering the dancing girls !
that's a circus .
these ... and these are on the house .
welcome home , ...
dawn .
there you go , mate .
thanks , mate .
ta .
what the fuck did they do to this fish?
batter it to death?
fish and chips .
the national dish , mate .
more like a national disaster .
keys .
twat .
come on .
so , err ...
how much are they paying you to wear that skirt?
fag?
no , motherfucker .
ah , mr mcelroy !
that's daring , but very dashing attire .
let's stick to the business in hand .
hey , come on !
mr mcelroy's a guest of ours .
ok boys guns on the table please
felix?
i've delivered him .
i'll have my tickets and be off .
ok .
put your gun on the table .
fuck .
the game's tomorrow .
put your fucking gun on the table , you gobshit !
what?
so , who's the chemist?
this is pudsey smith .
a first class man .
qualified and everything .
he can't talk .
he's been shot .
felix , have you shit your pants , or something?
something doesn't feel right , mr durant .
i know .
you're making me nervous , for fuck's sake !
sit on your hands , or something .
ok , mr mcelroy , the ball's in your court .
mdma utilises serotonin
opiates like hero in utilise dopamine
sort of like the same sensation you get after sex .
amphetamines increase adrenaline and cocaine gets those synapses in the brain firing really fast .
my product is 51 times stronger than cocaine .
51 times more hallucinogenic than acid and 51 times more explosive than ecstasy .
it's like a personal visit ... .. from god .
it's that good?
the dog's bollocks .
felix desouza .
i count ten .
that's right .
that's one million sterling , or 1 ... 1 . 6 million dollars .
but that ain't what we agreed on , is it?
you're 18 . 4 million dollars shy .
and i don't care how you cut it , that's a whole lot shy .
no ...
mr mcelroy , what we have there is a goodwill gesture .
a deposit .
a down payment .
one and a half million's not a bad start , is it?
i need to do some research .
i need to feed a few thousand to the kids , get some feedback .
you don't think i can allow you to walk out of here with $20 million for a formula that only exists in your head?
and all i get is what?
an ointment for toe jam .
uh huh?
market research .
right .
profile customers , send out questionnaires .
get out the bloody way , felix .
i can dig that .
but unless you've got what we agreed on , what the fuck am i doing here?
give me a call when you're ready to deal .
i fucking knew it .
room service .
that old fuckin 'chestnut .
aaargh !
hey hold it fellas !
it's my sausage and flamin 'mash !
ssh ...
sorry , love .
sorry about that , pet .
it's just that err ... my dad ran off with a room service maid .
things have never really been the same since .
bollocks .
now's not a good time .
change of plan what do you mean?
i want mcelroy kept alive .
i don't do alive , i do dead .
it's a matter of $20 million in cash being vaporised , and it's a matter of a lot of anger being directed at the lizardman .
you now do alive .
my future is inside mcelroy's skull
you waste anything and everybody that gets near him .
you waste them , not him .
his mind belongs to the lizard
shit .
fucking hell !
shit , shit , shit !
arsehole .
let go , you double crosser .
let go !
they're mine !
oh !
oh , shit .
shit .
ow !
shit !
i told you to get out of the way , felix .
fuck !
i've been shot .
where?
in the fucking arse !
man , it's just a flesh wound .
come on .
flesh wound?
is that supposed to sound like a fuckin 'good thing?
come on , dude .
oi , sooty .
sooty !

aaargh !
oh , fuck !

we've lost them .
yeah , well , let's not take any chances .
oh ...
oh , shit !
ugh ...

i need transportation .
i've got a cooper needing a lick of paint .
she goes .
throw in the xj6 and she's yours for a 100 quid .

what , a cooper?
piss off , popeye .
and you .
i'll tell you what 70 quid and the jag and i'm robbing myself .
tha ... that's it .
that's it .
i've had just about enough of this shit
i got you to that deal in one piece .
i got you out of that deal in one piece .
as far as i'm concerned , my job's done .
it's finished .
you can leave my motor alone , get your golf clubs , and fuck off back to dixie .
pay attention , felix desouza .
i atomised a major drugs syndicate to be here this morning .
now , i'm stuck in liver fucking fool with you !
and if i need you to sell your car to help me , you will sell your goddamn car !
do i look like the salvation army?
have i got jim'll fix it written on my fucking hat?
i'm sorry , mate , but help's not a word i'm too familiar with , you know .
fuck off !
i don't believe it .
so , who's the girl?
it's my ex girlfriend .
arthur .
i want you to describe the situation to me .
seven shades of shit in a one shit trumpet , sir .
it looks like some kind of a drugs buy .
none of your ordinary
aye aye .
got some blue tabs .
they look like sweets .
how are you?
what do you mean , how am i?
nearly cut my fucking ear off !
and i've hurt my knee .
now , i want you to get the pills and take them straight down to the lab , double time .
you got that?
and then you call me .
now , what else have you got?
six dead bodies and one live one .
chief , it's leopold durant .
durant?
right .
now , concentrate , arthur .
get that fat fuck down here pronto .
but , sir , he's dying .
then you'd better be fucking quick about it , hadn't you?
she dumped me .
two years ago now .
changed her name from dawn to dakota .
fucked off for las vegas and a deck of cards .
so who hired her to take me out?
you're asking the wrong question , mate .
she's your guardian angel .
if she wanted you dead you'd be dead
she never misses .
i mean , fucking look at that .
if she really wanted to hit me ...
i'd be shitting through a tube for the rest of my life .
someone wants you kept alive .
somebody's trying to cut in on durant's deal .
they're shitting again .
yeah , well , shit happens .
no
shit don't just happen , shit takes time .
shit takes effort . $20 million worth of effort .
i've got to get a new deal on , fast .
you know the town , you know the players .
look ... .. all i want is a ticket for the game .
do you think you can swing that? $20 million could swing anything .
you know what i'm selling .
well , how much?
5 % of whatever i get out of any deal you set up .
that's a million dollars .
hell , you could buy your own goddamn stadium with that .
game's tomorrow .
you'd better get started , then .
oh , and felix .
a word of advice .
you ever want to get the girl , you've got to broaden your horizons .
what the fuck is that?
what is it?
what?
scotch mist?
now , now , now , now , now .
you are getting greedy , leopold .
it's a big deal going down , and you are trying to cut me out of the fucking loop .
i told you .

this is going to cost you an additional 15 % .
no?
all right , then .
30 .
as you're being so difficult .
how about this?
50 50 .
why settle for anything less , eh?
60 40 .
leopold , i don't know if you noticed , my son , but you're in urgent need of a fucking doctor .
50 50 .

i'm sure that's dead easy where you come from .
fucking lab on every corner , is it?
piss off .
well , shit in a bag and punch it .
she's back .

this was a mistake .
most sensible thing you've said .
are you still shooting people for a living?
what kind of fucking career is that , then , eh?
look , can i come in?
and do what?
the dirty stop out doesn't come home till breakfast .
really good to be home .
it's great to see you again , love .
i wanted to see the world .
liverpool isn't the world .
i couldn't take america .
it was like fucking albania in neon .
and that stupid football shirt .
what kind of man jumps into bed shouting , " come on , you reds "?
she made me laugh .
good shag , though .
i tell you , she'd kill anyone for me , i'll say that for her .
he's got problems .
she's got problems .

in my lab .
you got a lab?
yeah , of course .
what do you take us for?
rank fucking amateurs?
come on !
just say no .
how the fuck did we end up in here?
one little mistake ... 30 years ago .
all of these items are over the counter .
nothing illegal here .
you're no fucking help , are you?
i beg to differ .
you see , it's not the ingredients themselves which determine the effect but the manner in which they're combined .
these kids are getting very smart .
he's right .
the ravers are the key .
aren't you the clever little chunky monkey?
you keep banging on about my weight .
you're crossing a line .
arthur , it was a joke .
it was a joke .
smile .
smile .
you fat cunt .
yo , blowjob .
pos 51 .
comes in blue or race car red .
destination : stratosphere .
only , this one gets you there in 60 seconds .
you try one first .
thought you'd never ask .
pos 51?
you can't call it that .
punters'll feel like right tits asking for tabs of 438 lou , whatever the number is .
no one's going to know what they're on about .
these scumbags spend their entire life smacked out of their heads .
numbers they couldn't even tell you what fucking time it is .
all right , mr smug , what have you done?
i think the shit's about to hit the fan .
arrrrrgh !
phew .
eurgh .
curry was a bad idea , lads .
oh yeah
please .
please .
oh , thanks .
oh , thanks .
oh
brothers gonna work it out .
brothers gonna work it out
he's a chemical brother !
mr mcelroy ... welcome .
how you doing , man?
spectacular is what i'm doing .
spectacular
nice skirt .
special occasion , is it?
are you going to be all right here on your own?
mm hm .
she's here .
right .
everything all right , lads?
problems?
no , man .
nothing we can't handle .
every chemical used in the production of this drug is 100 % legal .
not one ingredient is found on any known government's banned substance watch list .
hell , you can ship supertankers of this shit .
you can even lay a goddamn pipeline and no one would bat an eye .
pos 51 .
it's all that .
and it can be yours .
if the price ... is right .
chemistry ...
mr mcelroy .
what is chemistry ... .. but the ability to attract adoration in others?
you see , you're like me , mr mcelroy .
you're a sky highatrist , i'm a sky highatrist .
see i always knew i'd be a drug dealer even when i was a kid
i saw my dad hit my mother my mother hit my brother my brother hit my sister , and my sister fuck my father .
so it's inevitable , really .
you'd have to be on drugs just to live in that madhouse , wouldn't you?
drugs are good , mr mcelroy .
drugs are our mates .
fuck .
i'm getting on my own nerves .
what i'm trying to say to you , mr mcelroy , is ... .. i'm very much attracted to what you have to offer .
how are you doing , felix?
well , my boss is dead ... .. can't get a ticket for tomorrow's match , and , oh , yeah , i've got a fucking bullet hole in the arse .
apart from that ,
i'm tiptop .
so who's the target?
you've got that look in your eye .
i've been looking for you
oh , yeah?
for old times 'sake or for the company i keep?
little bit of both .
so , you have got me on your list , then?
you've always been on my list .
40 years ago a rock and roll revolution was launched in this town .
tonight , we're going to launch a new revolution .
one that will rock and roll your senses .
and you ... are my test pilots .
you're going to kiss the sun and taste the motherfuckin 'rainbow .
are you ready?
are ... you ... ready?
then let's get ready to party y y y .
have you any idea how much i missed you?
why didn't you stay with me , then?
what , me?
in america?
don't be soft !
besides , i don't know who you are any more , girl .
it's been nearly two years .
i haven't heard a word .
still ...
i always hoped ...
.. you might ... change your mind ... .. and come home .
we could have a fresh start .
aren't you going to say anything?
this , mr mcelroy , is a fucking miracle .
drug use will reach epidemic proportions , revolutions will break out , governments will fall !
20 million , and not a penny less !
where do i sign?
si ...
sign? !
this ain't some written contract .
the kind of agreement i could take you to court and sue your ass over .
you fuck me on this deal ,
i gotta take out a contract just to get even on the goddamn contract !
we think we have an agreement , we think we see things the same way .
either we do , or we don't .
you're either in , or you're out .
you give me the money , i give you the formula .
are we clear?
crystal , mr mcelroy .
crystal .
i'm not leo durant .
i'm a man of my word .
get in my way , and i'm gonna have to shoot you .
get in my way , and i'm gonna have to shoot you again .
i've got to work , babe .
fucking cow !
oh , fuck !
can't a brother just deal some goddamn drugs?
time to go , elmo .
mr kane .
is it that time of the month already?
i thought you weren't due till next week , you eager beaver .
now , ain't that always the way?
elevator music , a nigger in a kilt , and a chick with a nickel plated nine .
and now a word from our sponsor .
that ain't no liverpool accent .
say hello , elmo .
hello , elmo .
absence makes the heart grow fronder elmo
and the lizard is so full of motherfucking fonderence for you that he got on this plane just to come see you .
i'm touched .
you will be .
you got my cash?
you're flush , sweetcakes .
you are flush .
he's looking forward to seeing you .
so , what's the price tag on my ass?
it's enough .
move .
last stop .
there's nowhere from here but down .
reel me in !
why would i do a stupid thing like that?
pull me up , will you?
fold or call?
what?
you play poker .
fold or call?
i'm your last chance , girl .
i'm that out you've been looking for .
i'm only gonna make this offer once .
you either take it and get out from under the lizard , or you stay a slave and wonder where your life went .
you think you can save me , do you?
look where you are !
get real !
a million in bonds , untraceable .
that's real !
that's a fresh start .
try quitting while you're ahead for a change ...
dawn .
no .
no? !
i want 10 % of your deal with lki .
you're negotiating with me? !
look at your options .
10 % .
have a look at yours .
all right .
now that is a lovely dress .
need the extra room , do you?
tell me something .
i'm intrigued .
is it true that you fellas are equipped with incredibly ... .. large ...
fuck !
thanks .
my pleasure .
you can move your arm now .
right then you scouse git in the hast 12 hours this city has gone from a peaceful fun loving utopia to an all out fucking war zone .
and i , virgil kane ...
well , i want to know why .
nobody cuts me out of anything in this parochial pisshole .
you smell that , felix .
smell it .
smell it !
that is essence of durant .
and durant got what he deserved .
so , when a deal goes down , you , my old sausage , will fix it .
time and place .
and then you will call me .
otherwise ...
accessory to murder .
possession of a firearm .
you fuck me ,
i'll have you on your hands and your knees , with your arse in the air , exposing your rusty sheriff's badge for the next 20 years .
so ask yourself , are you going to help restore some national pride , and stick one on the yanks?
or , like the rest of your life , are you going to piss it all away?
are you going to help me to help you?
eight hours till kickoff .
it's a big game .
let's just see if you come good .
mr kane .
see ya !
you'll never walk alone , eh , mate?
help me to help you?
cunt !
how do you think that motherfucker would do against people who diss
like soso mcguire griffy?
they'd be knocking this shit out the park
he can't throw that kinda heat !
kevin's got what's goin 'on here !
bullshit
kevin brown couldn't carry sandy koufax's jockstrap .
you've been listening to too much vince scully .
you need to get your ear out of the radio , and carry your ass out to the ball game .
sorry , but err ... .. have i missed something?

elmo's propositioned her .
nice one , shirley .
i'm listening .
lizard offered dakota 250k to deliver my live ass to him .
i've made her a significantly better offer .
and i'm thinking ... she might entertain ... .. certain sentimental reasons for not doing her job .
the question is whether it's going to pay me ... to be sentimental .
look , we have a choice .
we can use our " get out of jail free " cards , or we can choose " stop , do not pass go " .
do not collect 20 million dollars .
do we have a deal?
do that again , i will definitely fucking shoot you .
shut your gob !
go and get yourself cleaned up !
and no shagging up there !
yeah .
no shagging up there .
we do this job and we get out .
it's what we all want , isn't it?
just to get out .
so , what's the plan?
you tell me .
what's the plan?
you tell me .

it's got to come from your belly .

the lizard travelled 12, 000 miles to settle accounts with you !
so?

i'm sick and tired of fucking chasing your ass !

i don't even know who the fuck you are !
oh , you've got some big fucking onions , elmo .
this ... is the most expensive candy on the market .
the drug's a fake , you know .
it's bogus .
it's what we chemists call a placebo .
it's whatever you want it to be .
you can run all the tests you want , and it'll look like the best shit in the universe , but the ingredients ... they cancel each other out .
fucking confusing the lizard ain't gonna fucking help your cause , elmo .
you've gotta give big ups to marketing .
the ability to make people believe .
the power of suggestion .
pos 51 .
i don't give a shit !
is this fucking science lecture over?
it will be in ... 23 seconds .
it takes 10 seconds for an imbibed liquid to reach the stomach
it takes the human body 81 seconds to heat that liquid to the point of chemical volatility .
you ... have 12 seconds left .
12 seconds?
what the fuck are you talking about?
and what is the big fucking umbrella?

as agreed .
what about the drug?
you conned us .
i conned them
we got paid .
is this , or is this not , worth 20 million dollars?
this castle's worth ,
i'd say , more like ... seven , seven and a half .
do you want to see the game?
mr mcelroy , you are a genuine mcelroy like myself , you say .
this is the tartan of my slave master .
i now claim his castle and his lands for my own .
