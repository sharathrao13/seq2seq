and i pray to god no one ever has to see ... the things that i saw .
you're my bestfriend .
daddy , wait !
daddy , wait .
adolf hitler ...
adolf hitler ... builds the german military machine ... and drags all of europe into war .
but even while france falls to hitler ...
america still refuses to join the fighting .
where's mccawley and walker?
still training , sir .
allright , danny .
now let's show 'em how to fly .
we're gonna play chicken .
you ready?
this ain't the farm , and these ain't no cropdusters .
i'm not playing chicken with you .
now don't be a baby .
i'll tell you what
i'm not doing it , rafe .
well , i'm coming right at you .
you can turn , or you can hit me .
it's up to you .

oh , boy .

ri uh , right .

i don't know .
make up your mind .
god , rafe , we're going right !
righty tighty !
aah !
whoo hoo !
whoo hoo hoo !
those are some smooth aces .
did you say something?
'cause let me tell ya , those farm boys are grounded !
yes , sir , an entirely unacceptable use ... of m m military aircraft , sir .
get my hat .
yes , sir .
get those hedge hoppers in doolittle's office .
after two years of training ... you believe that a $45, 000 airplane ... is there for your amusement?
no , sir .
i was just trying ... to keep my edge , major .
and when you did the outside loop last week ... what did you think that was?
honing your skills?
that's not training , mccawley .
that's a stunt .
and i personally consider it to be reckless ... and irresponsible .
major ...
how could that be , when you're famous ... for being the first man in the world ever to do it?
don't get cute with me , son .
no , sir , i don't mean to be disrespectful .
i just think that well , i
it is reckless and irresponsible ... if you're just doing it to be a show off .
but i was doing it to try to inspire the men , sir ... in the way that you've inspired me .
i believe the french even have a word for that ... when the men get together to honor their leaders .
they call it an homage , sir .
a what?
an homage , sir .
that's bullshit , mccawley !
but it's very , very good bullshit .
thank you , sir .
mccawley , you remind me of myself fifteen years ago .
which is why we need to discuss this .
have a seat , son .
the british have accepted you into the eagle squadron .
you're on your way to england tomorrow ... if you still want to go .
huh .
wow .
just a few british pilots are all that stand ... between hitler and total victory in europe .
they're gonna need all the help they can get .
yes , sir .
well , i'm on my way .
just for the record ...
i'm supposed to ask you to reconsider .
sir?
sooner or later we're gonna be in this war ... whether we like it or not .
and i'm gonna need all of my best pilots .
so it's my duty to ask you to stay .
major , what would you do?
if it was me ...
i'd go .
get out .
am i going bald right back here?
ooh !
man , i am one good lookin 'son of a bitch .
don't you ever die .
die .
that's exactly ... the concept you gotta work tonight .
you put a drop of this clove oil under your eyes ... and you let 'em sting and well up .
you get your nurse alone , take a breath ...
let her see your eyes glisten ... and say , " baby , they're training me for war ...
and i don't know what'll happen ...
but if i die tomorrow , i want to know ...
that we lived all we could tonight .
come on , guys !
we got nurses waitin '.
come on , before the rest of his hair falls out .
how could you do this?
well , doolittle assigned me .
he wanted me to get some real real combat training in .
well , guess what?
it's not training over there .
it's war .
where the losers die , and there aren't any winners just guys who turn into broken down wrecks ...
like my father .
yeah , i understand that , danny .
but i feel like i got a duty to go .
don't preach to me about duty , damn it .
i wear the same uniform you do .
now , if trouble wants me , i'm ready for it .
but why go looking for it?
god , danny , come on .
i'm gonna be twenty five .
i might as well be an old man .
they're gonna have me bein 'a flight instructor .
i don't wanna teach loops and barrel rolls .
i wanna be a combat fighter .
hey , come on !
the nurses can't d d dance by themselves .
let's go .
if the call of duty means seeing 150 men ... in their underwear every day ... we are here to serve .
i can't believe it .
saturday night in new york city .
do you know what they're doing where i come from?
nothing .
cow tipping .
well , that's why you joined the navy , hon '.
to get out of that dusty little town and see the world .
may i remind you , barbara , we're navy nurses , not tourists .
i joined to do my patriotic duty and ... to meet guys .
me , too .
girls , we're gonna have so much fun tonight in the city .
you've gotta tell them the story , evelyn .
what?
oh , come on .
tell us .
oh , it's such a long story .
we got time .
i saw it happen .
well , it was about four weeks ago ...
well , it was about four weeks ago ...
what do you think is b b better?
all in the one cheek , or spreading them out?
ok .
fusco , anthony .

sweetie , do you really have to do this?
i'm not gonna get yellow fever in my barracks .

if you'd rather , she can do it .
whoa , whoa , whoa .

x e. x e.
x e , ma'am .
ma'am , i know how this looks .
i'm sorry , lieutenant , i really am .
but army and navy requires 20/ 20 vision .
oh , i it's it's not a problem with my eyes .
i mean , i can see .
i mean , i can hit a running rabbit with a $3 . 00 pistol .
i got a problem with letters , that's all .
well , maybe after some schooling ... you could come back and take the test again .
no , i had schooling .
i mean , i the teachers just never knew ... what to make of it .
it's just letters .
i mix 'em up sometimes .
that's all .
i mean , i just get 'em backward sometimes .
l look here .
uh , my my math and and spacial reasoning ... and my verbal scores are all excellent .
but you barely passed the written exam .
yeah , but he did pass it .
so , is it my turn now?
no , you'll wait your turn .
yes , ma'am .
ma'am , i i'm never gonna be an english teacher .
but i know why i'm here .
to be a pilot .
and you don't dogfight with manuals .
you don't fly with gauges .
i mean , it's all about feeling and speed ... and lettin 'that plane become like a part ... of your body .
and that manual ... says that a guy who's a slow reader can't be a good pilot .
that file says i'm the best pilot in this room .
ma'am , please , don't take my wings .
well , i felt so bad .
evelyn , rotate to station three .
i had no choice .
i passed him .
good .
uh huh .
so , then this cocky pilot comes back .
say , fella , are you enlisted?
yeah .
yeah "?
boy , you're talking to an officer .
yes , sir .
sorry , sir .
give me that file .
yes , sir .
parade rest .
yes , sir .
ma'am , i didn't get a chance to thank you .
drop your skivvies .
ah , oh , ok .
just like this?
that's fine .
he did have a very cute butt .
you know , i know you didn't have to pass me ... and you did .
and i just
i didn't think you'd understand , and you did .
you know , you still haven't said thank you .
thank you .
you're welcome .
why'd you do it?
i mean , i'm just curious .
you're like my hero now .
actually , my father was a pilot .
and , um , i've seen first hand what happens ... when a pilot loses his wings .
you know what?
your father's my hero , then , too .
infact , as an officer , i think it'd by my duty ... to take my new hero's daughter out tonight ...
just to aah !
gosh , did i poke too deep?
i think you hit the bone there .
you are so mean .
what?
so is is there any chance ... that you might , kind of , sort of ... you know , like me , or ...
oh , how did you guess?
they never taught us ... how to deal with this ... feeling .
wh what feeling?
well , it's kind of like ... this .
ow !
well , he was getting fresh , so i poked him again .
all right , romeo .
i want to get this over with .
hold on a second .
miss ...
i really , really lick you .
what did he mean?
like you .
i didn't mean to say that .
and i just , um ...
i just want to ask you , please , if i can donate dinner .
he started to act very strange .
or , well , buy you dinner .
this isn't your chart .
whoa .
no .
that's the , uh , this , uh , fellow over here's .
i think he left .
have you already had this shot?
yeah , well , once ... already .
well , i wanted i mean , can i ask you out?
no !
and he just went wham !
unh !
oh !
what'd you do to him?
oh !
what'd you do to him?
poor guy .
hey !
hey !
oh , my god .
are you ok?
uh , yeah .
i'm fine .
i feel great .
this is just standard precautionary ... thing .
look , i got some , uh , genuine french champagne ... from france .
i thought , you know , maybe we could celebrate .
celebrate what?
oh , i don't know .
uh , well , you being my hero , for one .
ok .
why not?
so , uh , ahem ...
i wanted to thank you .
and i just wanted to , uh ... put your mind at ease about passing me ... because i really do think you did this country a service .
i mean , i'm i am a great flier .
and if you have a fault , which you obviously don't ... it's modesty .
no .
if i have a fault , it's candor .
you are just so
uhh .
cork just got away from me .
god , oh , it hurts .
it hurts something fierce .
i'm sorry .
ohh ...
oh , it's bleeding .
god .
oh !
ohh !
lay still .
i ruined everything .
lay still .
oh , it hurts .
ow !
it's cold .
it'll stop the bleeding .
yeah .
i can't breathe .
lay still .
you are so beautiful it hurts .
it's your nose that hurts .
no .
i think it's my heart .
and then i kissed him .
oh , evelyn .
that's the most romantic story i ever heard .
it's been the most romantic four weeks and two days of my life .
oh , i'm so jealous .
hello , lieutenant .
it's good to see you .
you , too , lieutenant .
pick a hand .
it's beautiful .
what's in your other hand?
mine .
well , it took me six hours to fold these .
oh !
i want you to meet my friends .
rafe , this is martha , barbara , sandra
hi .
i'm betty .
hi .
would you happen to have any friends?
huh .
take your pick .
hi .
whoo !
we ever get in this war and somethin 'happens to me ...
i can't tell you how good it makes me feel to know ... that someone as sweet as you will be there ... to nurse me back to health .
good , but we're not in the war yet .
ahem .
ok .
that was a bad line .
hi .
i'm i'm red .
red [ snorting ]
s s s s strange .
heh heh .
your last name's strange?
yeah .
she's all yours , soldier .
no .
it it's winkle .
red is such a ladies 'man .
do you always stutter?
no .
only when i'm [ snorting ]
she's totally buying it .
nervous?
yeah .
why can't i get something like that?
hello .
hi .
danny seems kind of shy around the girls .
tsk .
it's not that he's shy .
he's just , ahem ... a little unsure of himself , you know .
his old man used to run him down a lot .
get him in a plane , he's sure of himself .
he's like my brother .
he's like my best friend .
he's my right hand .
which at the moment is a long way south of my waist .
oh , i'm sorry .
i guess i lost a little altitude .
yeah , i guess you did .
excuse me .
you and me , we got to talk .
so , the rumor is the navy's shipping us to pearl harbor .
well , won't be so bad .
it's about as far from the fighting as you can get .
you'll get a sun tan .
so maybe the army'll post you guys there , too .
you ... are a super special woman .
and , and , well ...
well , they're they're training me ... to be a big bad warrior , and , well ...
so , i mean , you never know what might happen tomorrow ... or ... or any day after that , you know?
so ...
god , we need to make tonight super special .
why are you crying?
i guess it's the thought ... that i might not ever get to see you again .
dry your eyes , toots .
tonight , you're mine .
i don't want to be with a crowd tonight .
i just want to be alone with you .
well ...
how does new york harbor by moonlight sound?
ohh !
heh heh !
are you gonna be a bad influence?
of course i'm a bad influence .
let's see if we can commandeer this vessel ...
'cause we're , uh , officers of the u. s. government .
not for long , we won't be .
one day , we'll take a trip on a boat like that .
would you like that?
we'll be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grandsalon .
no one's talking about war .
they're just dancing to cole porter .
i'll have to get a tux .
yeah .
come on .
there you go .
all aboard .
you're out of your mind .
oh , yeah .
careful now .
here , sit down .
now let's see here .
ah !
there we go .
see , this is as close as i could get you to your ship .
so , at least i tried , right?
actually , you know what?
this is better .
yeah , it is .
god , you're pretty .
what's gonna become of us all , rafe?
well , the future's not exactly in our hands , is it?
no .
i guess you're right .
aah !
aah !
oh , my god !
are you all right?
yeah , are you?
that was not part of the date .
watch your step .
oh , thank you .
evelyn !
guys , come up !
come on up !
come up !
we're in 321 .
there's something i got to tell you .
well , you got no secrets from me , lieutenant .
i've seen your medical chart .
here we go .
this can't be good , or it wouldn't be so hard to say .
yep .
i got to go away .
we're all going away .
yeah ... but i'm going to the war ... tomorrow .
i'm flying with the eagle squadron .
it's an outfit the british started for american pilots .
i don't understand .
you're in the u. s. army .
how could they order you to go?
they didn't order me .
i volunteered .
huh .
but i passed you .
i let you through .
and now you volunteer ... for the most dangerous place you could go?
it's not your responsibility , not your choice .
flying's the only thing i ever wanted to do .
i mean , everything in my life has led me up to this point .
meeting you .
i love you .
i love you so much .
let's go inside .
all right .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
just i i can't do this .
this just it's not right .
i'm sorry .
i just
see , i can't do this .
i mean , i mean , i can .
i i want to .
i'm not trying to be noble , you know .
or not saying i know what would happen ... or just i need to stop talking .
i just i just don't want
i just don't want it to be like everybody else .
i don't want you to have anything about tonight ... that you regret .
i mean , it's been the most incredible night of my life ... and i don't want to ruin that .
oh , you couldn't ruin it .
if i had one more night to live , i'd want to spend it with you .
see , that's what i want to come home to .
that's what i want to have to think about and dream about .
i want to know that the best part of my life ... is still ahead of me .
look .
don't , um ... could you ... not come see me off?
because , uh ... saying good bye to you once is hard enough .
here .
take this .
why?
you think it looks good on me?
i will come back .
i thought you said you told her not to come .
yeah , i did .
why you looking for her then?
it's my test .
if i tell her not to come , and she comes anyway ... then i i know she loves me .
all aboard !
track 57 !
if , uh , anything happens to me ...
i want you to be the one to tell her .
all right?
you just make sure and come back for the both of us , all right?
ok .
see you when i get back .
yeah .
good hunting , rafe .
evelyn !
evelyn !
evelyn !
evelyn !
evelyn .
hey !
she loves me .
the german luftwaffe ... relentlessly bombards downtown london ... while churchill's royal air force ... is in a deadly struggle ... to maintain control of the british skies .
this is a real mess .
lieutenant mccawley reporting for duty , sir .
good .
we'll get you settled into your quarters .
and then introduce you to the crate you'll be flying .
if y'all are patching up bullet holes here ... maybe we ought to skip housekeeping ... and get me in an airplane .
two didn't come back , sir .
we counted only eleven .
are all yanks as anxious as you ... to get themselves killed , pilot officer?
not anxious to die , sir .
just anxious to matter .
this is yours .
good chap .
didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine .
please be seated , gentlemen .
i'm afraid i'm in a bad mood .
churchill and stalin are asking me what i'm asking you .
how long is america going to pretend ... the world is not at war?
we've increased food and oil shipments , mr. president ... and as far as i know
what they really need are tanks , planes ... bullets , bombs , and men to fight .
but our people think hitler and his nazit hugs ... are europe's problem .
we have to do more .
send the brits and russians more of our ships ... and anti aircraft weapons .
and keep cannibalizing the pacific fleet?
what choice do we have?
we're building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs .
this is so exciting .
you know there's about one hundred ships on pearl .
how many sailors per ship?
it depends .
more on a battleship than a sub .
but say , on average ... 2, 000?
then there's the flyers , the marines , base personnel .
i'm still working on the sailors .
girls , i think the odds are in your favor .
yeah , like 4, 000 to one .
it's paradise .
see you on the beach , boys !
we're in hawaii !
hey !
you're not supposed to paint titties ... on the side of my airplanes .
and if you do , don't make 'em lopsided .
they were lopsided , earl .
look , it says right here .
never ride waves amongst rocks or submerged pilings .
see , it says you shouldn't do that .
how do you know they're submerged if they're submerged?
gooz , what in the hell are you doing?
just trying to fix this surfboard thing .
he keeps taking chunks off his nose on the rocks .
on my day off , i'm working on my new invention the gooz cruise fin .
i'm gonna be a rich fella .
every surfboard in the nation's gonna need one .
yeah?
well , you're gonna need a broom .
check out these new recruits .
hi .
aloha .
y'all pilots?
we're working on it .
it's a lot of switches and stuff .
pride of the pacific .
who are you?
terrors of the skies .
welcome , ladies .
hi .
i have to deal with toasty sun burnt fanny ... before i can show you around .
ow !
dear evelyn .
it's different than i thought it would be here .
it's cold so cold it goes deep into your bones .
there is one place i can go to find warmth .
that is to think of you .
i just wish i could be back there with you .
it's not easy making friends .
two days ago , i had a beer ... with a couple of the raf pilots .
yesterday , both of them got killed .
dear rafe .
i miss you so much .
it's so strange to be half a world away from you .
i'm right on his tail !
got one !
every night i look at the sunset ... and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day ... and send it from my heart to yours .
family?
girl , sir .
the girl .
a lot of people frown on the yanks ... for not being in this war yet .
i'd just like to say ... if there are many more back home like you ...
god help anyone who goes to war with america .
atten hut !
attention on deck !
admiral kimmel ...
commander in chief , pacific fleet , on deck .
sharp presentation , captain .
thank you , admiral kimmel .
for four months now washington's been blowing pink smoke ... about the threat from japan .
could make us lose our fighting edge .
i'm determined not to let that happen .
with your permission , captain .
admiral , urgent , from washington .
i'm supposed to keep this fleet ... battle ready to take on the japanese ... cover half the damn globe .
now they want me to transfer ... another twelve destroyers to the atlantic .
don't they know what we're facing out here?
they feel europe is the greater danger .
i'm assuming these risk assessments include hawaii?
pearl harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack .
we're surrounded by sub nets .
all we need worry about is sabotage ... so we bunched our planes together ... to make them easier to protect .
distance is our ally , admiral .
you analysts got it all figured out , don't you?
the smart enemy hits you ... exactly where you think you're safe .
incoming !
i fixed the hydraulics and electrics , sir ... but the oil hoses still need attention .
just crank it , lan !
god speed you , sir .
red section , take the bombers .
blue section , look out for the fighters .

when i'm up there getting my slate wiped clean ...
i'm thinking how to dirty it up again .
wow , this from a virgin !
i got to inventory supplies .
kill me now .
could you be any more boring?
don't bother .
sunday , she writes rafe ... ten pages instead of the usual five .
gosh , i wish i was in love .
hey , sweetheart .
she hates me .
good to see you , red .
good to see you , too , betty .

now if we don'twin ...
teeny here has to find another battleship !
i'm not going back to the arizona empty handed .
don't worry about the money .
i'll send that smug engine fixin 'snipe ... back below decks where he belong .
we the man !
he slapped your mama !
be a son of a bitch !
look at this !
all right , dorie !
that's enough .
that's enough .
oh !
where's my money?
nah , fight's rigged .
we're rich !
ha ha ha !
how'd you get this?
boxing .
did you win?
yes , ma'am .
what do you get for winning?
respect .
so , why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?
i left my momma in texas ... and joined the navy to see the world ... become a man .
they made me a cook .
not even that .
i clean up after other sailors eat .
two years , they never even let me fire a weapon .
well , let's hope you never have to .
yes , ma'am .
you take care , petty officer miller .
you , too , ma'am .
you know , he taught me to fly .
i always knew that no matter what trouble i got into ...
i'd never be in it alone .
he'd be there with me .
he was always pushing me to be better and faster .
he told me you were a great flier .
it was the same night he told me ... he'd volunteered to go to england .
volunteered?
he ... he told me he'd been assigned .
he was always trying to protect me .
but you know what?
i look at myself in the mirror in this uniform ... and i still don't know who i am .
i look like a hero ... but i don't feel like it .
rafe ... he always looked the part , didn't he?
he couldn't wait to be one .
to rafe mccawley .
the best pilot ... and the best friend i ever knew ... or ever will know .
to rafe .
look at this .
the japanese ... are flooding the pacific with radio traffic .
everywhere from the panama canal to southeast asia .
there's no logical pattern , captain .
no .
there's always logic .
they know we read their mail .
they're trying to make us think their fleet is moving south .
i'm not buying it .
something , something's up .
otherwise , why would they take the trouble to bullshit me?
evelyn , i signed for these letters for you today .
they're from england .
they're from rafe .
i'm sorry , ev .
you know how long it takes mail to get here .
hurry up !
show time , boys !
come on !
america still awaits japan's response ... to peace proposals .
ambassador nomura arrives in washington ... in what could hopefully guarantee ... continued peace in the pacific .
on the british front , churchill declares ...
give us the tools , and we will finish thejob .
the raf has fought bravely against ...
hitler's ambition to rule the skies over the channel .
victory does not come without sacrifice .
evelyn !
danny .
hey .
some comedy , huh?
yeah .
it's been a while .
i've been logging a lot of flight hours .
i kinda been avoiding you , too .
yeah .
look  do you
do you want to?
sure , yeah .
i remember one time when i was ...
like , seven years old ...
i was always building gadgets and things .
he wanted me to build him some wings ... so he could fly like his daddy .
i told him you can't fly without some kind of engine .
but he wouldn't listen .
danny , never mind that , just build 'em anyway .
so i did .
and i'm up there ... strapping these big ol 'wings on his back ... that we made from paper and glue ... and these massive silk bloomers that we stole .
he looked so stupid , and i told him ...
you can't jump off the barn in these .
and bam !
he busted his leg on a backhoe .
god , i miss him .
yeah .
but don't you think ... that rafe wasn't back upthere next day .
cast and everything ... telling me to make some adjustments on those wings .
check this out !
crossroads of the pacific .

look at this .
hello !

i guess i should go .
don't let it be three months before i see you again .
i had a good time .
yeah , me , too .
do you want me to walk you home?
no , i'll be fine .
no ... of course .
good night .
good night .
i was just wondering if maybe i could come by some time ... get a cup of coffee or a piece of pie?
what am i doing?

you were asleep .
i'm sorry .
danny?

no !
nothing's wrong .
no problem .
hi !
it's just danny .

oh ... thanks .
it was good of you to take the trouble ... to drop it over ... now .
i ... well , i thought you might need it .
you know ... maybe tomorrow morning .
if ... not that you wear this to work , but ...
no ... it's a hankie .
right , right .
yeah .
listen , i was thinking maybe ...
i could come by some time ... if i gave you a call , could i come by?
once , maybe ... if you're not busy?
yeah , maybe .
maybe?
maybe .
ok , all right .
thanks .
good bye .
good night .
you are such an idiot !
did you have fun last night?
it wasn't how it looked .
and if it was , it'd be all right .
it's been months .
it's time to move on .
i am moving on .
ev , don't lie .
all i know is , i hear you crying when you think i'm asleep .
when my dad left ...
i was too much for my mom to handle ... so she sent me to live with my aunt .
i thought my life was over ...
but you don't know where it's all gonna lead .
if i hadn't run away and lied about my age ... and enlisted in the navy ...
i wouldn't have met red , and ... now he's my fiance .
oh , god , i can't get used to that word .
it's only been twelve hours .
oh , betty !
little betty beat us all to the post .
and this is ward three .
as you can see , no patients .
welcome to hawaii .
come on , i'll show you the bar .
sandra , new recruits to torture .
come on .
excuse me , ladies?
hi !
we're gonna wait two years until i'm nineteen ... and red can buy me a ring .
rafe sent his best friend to tell you ... so you would be ok , so you can move on .
you gotta go on living , ev .
red !
whoo !
sorry !
bye , rafe .
the japanese fleet is missing .
they're operating under radio silence .
this footage was shot four days ago on october 28th .
we're sending scout planes in wider vectors ... all over the pacific , but they get nothing .
they could be anywhere in here .
i don't understand how two whole carrier divisions ... can just disappear .
clear !
aw , we're all over the page .
we got one wall eyed and one pigeon toed .
anthony , tap in number six .
all right .
gooz , tap in number three .
all right .
hey .
we got a visitor .
oh ... that ain't no navy issue uniform , eh?
danny , it's evelyn .
jesus !
you allright?
yeah .
yeah .
no .
i think i'm fallin 'for her .
wow .
you know , i saw this coming .
i didn't want this to happen .
it just kind of did .
can't help it .
well , danny , she's gotta be with somebody .
it might as well be you .
you telling me if you were dead ... and you saw your best buddy doin 'your girl ... you wouldn't come back and beat the living crap outta him?
tony , back off .
i'd be back so fast .
danny's being a better friend taking care of her himself .
i got a girlfriend .
that's great .
come on , fellas .
let's split .
danny , whatever happens now is just about you and her .
you gotta try and forget about rafe .
be careful , allright?
ladies ... cloud the mind .
thanks , gooz .
you're welcome .
hey , danny .
where's everybody going?
just bein 'discreet .
does it seem like everybody's acting a little strange?
no .
nah .
right .
well , maybe maybe a little .
yeah .
well , people in this outfit ... have way too much time on their hands .
oh , yeah .
i just hope they don't think there's been something ... goin 'on between us , that's all .
oh , no .
i mean , no .
that would be ... embarrassing , right?
forgot my wrenches .
that would definitely be embarrassing .
yeah .
ha .

hey .
he really doesn't have to leave .
no .
i , uh , i'm just goin 'out with the girls , so ...
i guess i'll see you later .
yeah .
all right .
yeah , all right .
i'll see you around .
shit .
evelyn .
have you ever seen pearl harbor at sunset?
of course .
well ... from the air?
you know , i could get kicked out of the military for this .
really?
yeah .
stay down .
the hawaiians called this harbor wai momi .
it means " water of pearls .
it's so beautiful .
my dad took me up a couple of times .
just don't do what he did .
what do you call it when you flip over?
a barrelroll?
yeah .
i won't .
aah !
oh !
ha ha ha ha !
oh , god .
what do you think?
i like that .
hey !
that plane was supposed to be back here an hour ago !
quick , hide in the parachute hangar .
my heart is pounding .
danny , last night ...
no , that's terrible .
danny , we need to talk about this .
sir .
evelyn !
danny .
hey .
hi .
hi .
i didn't sleep a wink last night .
i had to see you .
last night was crazy , i know , but ...
i'm not sorry .
are you?
i don't know .
danny , i had a wonderful time last night .
i
it's just all too fast .
listen , evelyn , i was just down at the beach this morning ... and i watched the sun rise ... and i knew that everything was gonna be different .
that this was the start of something new .
in this place , in this moment .
and i don't care what anybody else says , you know?
how can i not feel this way?
i kinda like you .
oh , you do?
you have your tie on crooked .
everything's gonna be all right , ok?
everything's gonna be all right .
do you have any airtours going through the valley of oahu?
you do?
male radlohost : aloha .
this is kgmb in honolulu ... on another beautiful fall day here in paradise .
we have enough information .
we are returning home .
do you ever wonder ... if this war's gonna catch up with us?
nota whole lot .
every moment we're not together , you're upthere training for it .
yeah , well , i'm training for moments like these ...
'cause i have no idea ... how i'm gonna get this car out of the sand .
evelyn , can you please come out of the bathroom?
you've been there for an hour .
evelyn !
what are you trying to do , look like me?
are you ok?
yeah .
what's the matter?
no , you
d'oy .
they call it the vacant sea .
none of the major sea lanes go through it ... and you can bury the entire land mass of asia there ... and nobody would know .
from there , they could attack anywhere .
our last signals intercept ... indicate that the japanese taskforce is heading south ... towards the philippines or southeast asia .
but captain thurman of naval intelligence here ... has his own theory about the missing ships .
sir , i believe they'll try to hit us ... where it'll hurt us the most pearl harbor .
it's over 4, 000 nautical miles from japan to pearl .
that's a long distance to steam a navy , captain .
your theory is based on what?
well , it's what i would do .
that's not exactly hard evidence , captain thurman .
well , admiral , if i had hard evidence ... we'd already be at war .
sir , we can read their diplomatic codes ... faster than they can type them .
but captain thurman's cryptology team ... is still trying to crack the naval codes .
the intercepts have missing words and garbled lines ... so to explain the decrypts , we have to try to interpret ... what we think they're trying to do .
interpret?
you mean guess .
they use their informed intuition , sir .
we guess .
it's like playing chess in the dark .
any rumor , troop movement , ship movement ... spine tingle , goose bump , we pay attention to it .
when i was in the asiatic fleet ... the locals used to try to get outside of a problem ... to try to see the inside .
well , i see a strike on pearl .
it's the worst thing that could happen .
a blow to pearl would devastate ... the pacific fleet's ability to make war .
so , sir , you would have us mobilize the entire fleet ... at the cost of millions of dollars ... based on this spine tingling feeling of yours?
no , sir .
my job is to gather and interpret material .
making difficult decisions ... based on incomplete information ... from my limited decoding ability ... is your job , sir .
then break the damn naval code , captain ... so i can make a better decision .
aye , sir .
we are trying .
i wonder if we shouldn't put the pacific fleet on full alert .
in case the optimism ... of the " honolulu advertiser " proves unfounded , gentlemen ... what are general short and the army ... going to do about protecting my ships?
within a ten mile radius of your harbor ... we have fighterplanes here at wheeler ... bombers at hickam , and a trainingstrip at haleiwa .
we've recently established a radar station here ... that can detect planes 125 miles out .
which is a month old , admiral , and untested .
i've seen these new radar screens , major .
there's no way of telling whether they're ours , theirs ... or a flock of damn birds .
i'm intercepting a call from tokyo ... to somewhere close by pearl .
there's a call from tokyo .
they say they don't know you .
hello?
hai .
it's a local dentist .
he can see pearl harbor from his office .
are there many sailors around?
uh , the dentist says that the flatships ... are not in port .
they're talking about the weather .
he doesn't seem to know who he's talking to .
hello?
hello?
moshi moshi .
hello?
that was a strange call .
admiral , may i speak to you in private?
why would a spy use a phone?
they know we tap all international lines .
our listeners feel it's probably not code talk .
it sounds like someone in japan is sneaking around ... asking a local citizen the location of our carriers .
well , that makes me feel all warm inside .
get the fbi on it immediately .
have we found the goddamn japanese fleet yet?
no , admiral .
the bases are looking all over the pacific .
so the entire fleet could be rounding diamond head ... and we wouldn't know a thing about it .
get on it .
i'm alive .
this is the first i could get word out .
jepense qu'll est mort !
ll estencore en vie .
i told you i'd come back .
here , sit down .
sit down .
come here .
it's ok .
it's all right .
you're real .
yeah .
i wished for this every day .
i know .
me , too .
every second .
so did i.
i thought you were dead .
they said you were shot down in the sea .
yeah , i was .
i was in the ocean .
it was so cold .
i missed you .
i got picked up by a french fishing boat ... and i was in occupied france , and i couldn't get word out .
and i'm just i'll tell you all about it , i promise .
but i'm fine .
i'm ok .
and i'm here now .
evelyn ...
i just wanted to see you .
you're so beautiful .
i love you .
hey , it's ok .
it's ok .
evelyn , evelyn .
i'm back .
it's ok .
i won't leave you again , i promise .
rafe , you died .
and so did i.
i know , but i'm i'm it's fine now .
i'm back .
we're together .
i mean , we are together ... right?
i don't know where i am .
rafe .
rafe .
stay away .
rafe .
this is radio honolulu ... playing the sweetest music ... on the sweetest island in the pacific .
it's a beautiful december 6th ... with beautiful music ...
raaaaafe !
oh , goddamnit .
there you go .
a real live ace !
whoo !
an ace is only five .
i shot down six m. e. s .
and i got two smokers , too .
they don't count them .
of course , i got shot down myself before they could pin me .
so you got back from behind enemy lines , huh?
what's that combat like?
were you scared?
hey !
one at a time .
well , them luftwaffe boys can fly pretty good .
it's not like , you know , training .
they're , uh ...
danny .
you know , they're all about tactics is what it is .
see , the nazis , right , they're faster than you are ... so they'll disappear and they get up in the soup ... and they'll throw like a roll or a hammerhead ... and they'll come around on your high side ... shoot you from behind like some americans will .
hey ...
gooz , you're lookin 'at a real live ace .
well , let me give you the shirt off my back !
whoo !
aloha !
there you go !
i'll take it from you .
i can see how y'all been spending your time out here .
hey , rafe , we gotta talk , all right?
i got nothin 'to talk about with you .
here .
why don't you have a drink?
i'll make a toast .
to returning from the dead .
wasn't all i expected , but , well , that's life .
to my best friend and loyal buddy danny ... for keepin 'up the war effort back here at home .
ahh .
you know , where i come from ... somebody makes a toast to you and you don't drink ... that's sayin 'something .
all right , rafe .
that's how it's gonna be .
to you .
hey , you guys need to spend some time alone , i think .
aw , hell , no , red .
come on .
no , no , no .
we're celebratin 'here .
me over there fightin '... almost gettin 'killed ... my friend danny back here ...
lookin 'after my interests for me .
y'all know danny was even good enough ... to look out for my girl for me while i was gone?
we thought you were dead , rafe .
and it gutted us both .
and we were just tryin 'to get on with our lives .
life is good , ain't it , danny?
you know , you're a rotten drunk .
you always have been .
well , you're a lousy friend .
that's a new development .
you left her to fight somebody else's war ... and you made damn sure that i didn't go with you ... and we thought that you were dead
i almost did die , you little son of a bitch !
and her face was the last thing that went through my mind ... so don't stand there and tell me to act like it's all right !
yeah , rafe , well , i stayed .
i stayed , and you made sure of that ... and some things changed .
and i hope you can get used to that .
oh , i have to get used to it?
all right .
we'll see how i can get used to it .
whoa !
hey !
get used to that , boy !
hey , hey !
and that's my left hand , too !
hey , hey , hey !
hey , come on !
melee at the hula la .
send m. p. s !
aah !
aah !
you called me a lousy friend?
get your hands off !
aah !
ow !
shit !
come on , danny !
let's go get 'em .
let's move out !
oh , no .
they're gonna throw us in the brig .
let's get outta here .
oh , shit .
rafe ... you're the only family i got .
when you were gone ... it was the loneliest i'd ever been .
the same for her , too .
oh , boy , now you're really breakin 'my heart .
if you hadn't gone , none of this woulda happened .
oh , so it's my fault , i guess .
damn it , rafe .
i just know there's got to be some way ... we can work things out so that ... things could be right between me and you .
i just don't see how it could ever be the same .
revered father ...
i go now to fulfill my mission and my destiny .
i hope it is a destiny ... that will bring honor to our family ... and if it requires my life ...
i will sacrifice it gladly ... to be a good servant of our nation .
hey ... we got a large haze .
that's too big to be planes , right?
is that what you wanna do?
knight to knight five?
boom !
wrong move .
lieutenant , radar's picking up ... a large return moving in from the northeast .
hang on .
relax .
it's a flight of b 17s coming in from the mainland .
nothing to worry about .
a heck of a lot of b 17s .
good shot , hop .
this better be good , commander .
one of our destroyers reports having fired and sunk ... enemy submarine attempting to enter pearl harbor at 0653 .
it's 7 : 20 !

relay this to washington .
recall the staff .
failure ...
'peace talks ...
useless .
thurman here .
tokyo transmitting ... to their embassy in washington

and dispose of immediately .
special emphasis on destroying important parts .
do you read that?
acknowledge .
admiral ...
naval intel intercepted a transmission from tokyo ... to the japanese embassy in washington ... instructing them to break apart all decoder machines ... and burn all secret documents .
the japanese are expecting a war .
should we?
warning of possible ...
japanese aggressive movement in any direction .
broken relationship .
hostilities imminent .
but where?
did you ever lose a fight , miller?
