#### [ playing the blues ]
d'oh !
would you turn off that rock 'n 'rock music?
don't have a stegosaurus , man .
these talking dinosaurs are more real ... than most real families on tv .
ooh !
ooh !
ooh !
look , maggie , they have a baby too .
it's like they saw our lives and put it up on screen .
kids , i know you're excited ... about meeting aunt selma's boyfriend .
before he gets here ...
i should tell you something about him something disturbing .
ooh !
ooh !
ee ugh !
aunt selma has this crazy obsession ... about not dying alone ... so in desperation ... she joined this prison pen pal program .
her new sweetie is a jailbird .
cool , he can teach us ... how to kill a man with a lunch tray .
now , now , he's an ex convict .
he's paid his debt to society .
then why aren't you using ... the good silverware?
i'm just not .
that's them .
remember , everyone ... be understanding and forgiving ... for the sake of family unity .
everyone ...
i'd like you to meet
aah !
it's sideshow bob !
what the ..?
i'm afraid their reaction is understandable .
bart is the shamus in short pants who sent me to prison .
your new boyfriend here framed krusty the clown ...
for armed robbery .
if some snot nosed little kid sent me to prison ... the first thing out i'd find out where he lives ... and tear him a new belly button .
lousy snitch .
yaah !
you're forgetting the first two noble truths ... of the buddha .
i am not .
yes , you are .
one : existence is suffering .
two : the cause of suffering is desire in this case , my desire to do high quality ... children's programming .
when prison ended that dream , i became a seething cauldron ... of rage and recrimination .
when i was nominated for best supporting performer ... in a children 's program at the daytime emmy awards ... my bitterness ruined the greatest night of my life .
droopy drawers ...
colonel coward ...
pepito , the biggest cat in the whole wide world ...
sideshow bob ... and suckup the vacuum .
and the emmy goes to ...
i don't believe this ...
sideshow bob .
this is one more emmy than you'll ever win ... you bantering jack in the box !
just don't drop it in the shower .
no talent , shill !
second banana !
panderer !
bore !
uh , now for the highlight of the evening
best film to video transfer .
do you know what prison is like ... for a life long republican?
in our overcrowded cell we became little more than beasts .
who used my chap stick?
oh , i did .
here you go .
i don't want it .
my only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge ... against the boy who put me there .
ay , caramba !
bart , if i wanted to kill you ...
i'd have choked you as soon as i walked in .
but what kind of guest would i have been?
now , where was i?
ah , yes my lowest ebb .
you can't take my emmy .
you know the rules : awards for entertainment are contraband .
no emmys , no oscars , not even a golden globe .
but kismet be kind , well as cruel .
i received an answer to my letter ... from the prison pen pal program .
dear # 2 460 1 ...
i need a man and cannot find one ...
among the law abiding .
i have a steady job and a lucrative hobby :: " filing nuisance lawsuits .
i share an apartment with my twin sister .
enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike .
i forget which one i am .
dear selma ...
''your latest letter set off a riot ... in the maximum security wing of my heart .
ohhh ...
like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard ... our love bloomed despite all obstacles .
selma , may i?
uh , uh , uh ... on the cheek .
inspired by the love of a good woman ...
i resolved to be the best darned inmate # 2 460 1 i could be .
i bade farewell to my cellmates ... and left with the woman i loved .
cutter .
icepick .
snake .
i'm going to miss you most of all .
aww !
what a beautiful story , sideshow bob .
you're living proof that our revolving door prison system works .
i've never seen you so happy giggling like a schoolgirl .
i've got to admit it , selma ... he's a once in a lifetime catch .
i hope the police are saying that as well .
i can't believe you guys .
this man framed krusty the clown .
bart !
indeed , i did ... and i thank you for catching me .
you seized the wheel ... of my slow boat to hell , and pointed it ... towards the sunny shores of selma .
here , here .
would you mind ... if i did something bold and shocking ... in front of your family?
all right , but no tongues .
though kissing you is like kissing some divine ashtray ... that's not what i had in mind .
selma , will you marry me?
don't be a fool .
that man is scum .
then call me " mrs. scum .
161 ]
could you ... pumice my corns for me?
avec plaisir .
a " ...

close enough .
may you drive safely ... and find true love .
we now return to ... [ skipped item nr .
170 ]
whoo hoo !
i love you people !
i love my kids !
poor little guys .
so tragic .
so nauseous .
you should see the bus they came to the studio in .
what's next?
oh , yeah .
and now , a man who needs no introduction ...
the chairman of the company " you know who i'm talking about .
get out here , you gumba !
182 ] who wants to say hello .
huh?
what?
i can 't believe it !
they 've been feuding for years .
come here , you .
oh , you old clown , you .
i missed you .
this guy is a national treasure .
that jerk i got to replace you , he isn't fit to hold your slide whistle .
all i can be is myself .
krusty , can you ever forgive me for putting you in jail?
if they open the books on this telethon i'm right back in there .
that sideshow bob is a no good show biz phony .
come on , bart.
if krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him surely you can too .
196 ]
now , about your wedding dress ... how should i put this?
white !
white .
what would you like for appetizers?
ooh , appetizers .
homer , you're a trencherman .
what should we serve?
well , you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies .
they taste as good as they look ... and they come in this delicious red sauce .
it looks like ketchup , it tastes like ketchup ... but , brother , it ain't ketchup !
selma , he makes a good case .
whatever you want .
it all tastes like styrofoam to me .
selma , dear , i'm confused .
when i was a kid ... we were playing with bottle rockets ... and one shot straight up my nose .
i permanently lost my sense of taste and smell .
okay , we've got cocktail weenies and swedish meatballs .
selma , this wedding is spinning out of control .
i've run through eight of the ten dollars ... they gave me when i left prison .
i told you i got money .
i bought stock in a mace company ... just before society crumbled .
selma , that's wonderful !
i hope people don't think ...
i 'm marrying you for your money ... instead of your ...
less tangible qualities .
tomorrow we'll be mr. and mrs. bob terwilliger .
isn't it grand?
hey , bob , give some of that honey this way .
mmm ... mmm !
holy frijoles !
we've got ten minutes till macgyver .
driver , here's a fin .
get me home , and don't spare the whip .
whatever you say , mum .
what did i miss?
macgyver was wearing a tank top .
dang .
but i'm the only man in your life .
sit down and shut up !
seor macgyver , you saved our village .
don 't thank me .
thank the moon 's gravitational pull .
that macgyver's a genius .
first of all , he's not a genius .
he's an actor .
and second , he's not much of an actor .
you're lying .
you're lying !
no , this is lying that was a well plotted piece of non claptrap ... that never made me retch .
no !
he was so cruel .
the things he said ... they're just not true .
there .
there .
the wedding's off .
fiddle dee dee .
tomorrow's another day .
bart , stop that !
no , he's right .
we're a package .
love me , love macgyver .
i guess the wedding's off .
selma , i don't know what to say .
just tell me you like macgyver .
very well .
i i
i can't do it !
even that car chase seemed tacked on .
would you two knock it off?
i hate all the programs marge likes ... but it's no big deal .
you know why?
no .
go on .
whenever marge puts on ... one of her nonviolent programs , i take a walk .
i go to a bar , i pound a few ... then i stumble home in the mood for love .
very well , selma .
whenever you watch macgyver ...
i'll take a vigorous constitutional ... and return more in love than ever .
oh , bob .
bart no like .
bad medicine .
i could have been the flower girl ... and i wouldn't keep falling down either .
hey , they chose maggie , okay?
if you want to go for cutesyness ... instead of competence , fine .
do you , bob , take selma ... to have and to hold , in sickness and in health ... till death do you part?
293 ]
mmm .
oh .
hey , wiener boy ... where do you think you 're going?
i'm the only single girl left in the family .
well , i guess it could be worse .
oh , there's krusty the clown .
krusty !
krusty , say something funny .
oh , gee , a joke , huh?
um ... uh ... funny .
okay , this guy walks into a bar ... and takes out a tiny piano and a 1 2 inch pianist
oh , no , wait .
i can't tell that one .
dear friends , 41 years ago ...
god took 1 68 pounds of clay , and he made me a woman ... and for this , i thank him .
i just wanted to say ... on the advice of my new husband ...
i've decided to give up smoking ... [ cheering ]
except for after meals and after macgyver .
selma , dear , you'll bury us all .
chief wiggum , you've been around .
you don't trust sideshow bob , do you?
lighten up , son .
if he was going to commit a crime ... would he have invited the number one cop in town?
now , where did i put my gun?
oh , yeah .
i set it down when i got some cake .
i don't know what to say .
just tell me what you know i want to hear .
i'm dying of jealousy .
thank you .
that's right , dear .
enjoy your rest .
the wedding was very tough on you ... and the honeymoon is going to be ... murder .
welcome to our video honeymoon .
we're using the video camera cousin doug gave us ... and the videocassette homer gave us .
hey , and after we watch this , we can tape over it .
there's shelbyville falls , rolling rock ... and here's another breathtaking sight ... my brand new hubby .
i wanted a room with a fireplace ... you brainless luggage monkey !
like the one in your brochure !
oh , selma , dear .
i was just chatting with my good friend ...
dennis .
now , smile for the camera , that's a good lad .
ah , fire
scourge of prometheus , toaster of marshmallows ... eradicator of deadwood .
oh , selma , dear you and your little camera .
what do you say we shut it off for a while?
and make love?
i suppose so .
oh , that 's sweet .
why would sideshow bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
because he wants his honeymoon ... to be romantic .
romantic?
with aunt selma?
i guess you're too young to understand .
hmm ... [ selma moaning ]
bob , one of my fillings fell out .
even murder has its ugly side .
bob , would you mind rubbing my feet?
darling , you make it sound like a chore .
ooh .
oh .
good .
mmm .
soon i will kill you .
huh?
son pieds sentit beau
french for " her foot smells lovely .
oh .
prepare to be murdered .
huh?
that's ...
sanskrit for " your toes are like perfume .
voy a matar a usted .
wha?
that's spanish for " i am going to kill you .
say what?
i do believe it's time ... for your beloved macgyver .
oh , hey , you're right .
well , time for my walk .
mm .
don't forget to die .
ding dong .
i was feeling kind of lonely without selma .
mind if i watch tvwith you?
oh , go ahead , patty .
tonight , on macgyver ...
macgyver ...
macgyver ...
macgyver ...
aunt selma has one hour to live .
hey , down in front .
good bye .
front desk , there's been a terrible accident in my room !
poor selma .
you were having ... such a lovely evening ...
404 ]
selma !
oh !
you tried to kill me .
i want a separation .
my best laid plans have gang agley .
do you have room in your jail ... for a two time loser?
no , but that never stopped us before .
bart , i must know ... how did you untangle my web?
yeah , bart , clue us in .
i'd hate to tell the number one cop in town ... how to do his job .
no , please , it's the only way i'll learn .
all right .
sideshow bob seemed desperate ... to get that fireplace , but why?
then it hit me
the gas !
surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak ... except aunt selma .
i permanently lost my sense of smell .
she happily watched macgyver ... unaware that her room ... was silently filling with natural gas .
all it needed to explode ... was a single spark , say , from a cigarette .
i 've decided ... to give up smoking ... except after meals and macgyver .
her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow witted father .
when aunt selma lights up after macgyver ... she'll be blown to kingdom come .
come again?
after trying four times to explain it to homer ...
i explained it to mom and we were on our way !
to the simpson mobile !
443 ]
but wait .
if you saved selma , why did the room explode?
oh , i'll field that one .
446 ]
oh , right , the gas .
448 ]
with all my criminal buddies !
i feel like such a fool .
well , he fooled almost everyone ... but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust .
thanks , mom .
now , let's get out of this gas filled hallway ...
before we all suffocate .
shh .
