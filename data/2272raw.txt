she'll come and fetch me .
my mother'll come and fetch me .
mom .
mom .
hello .
what's your name?
nikita .
nice name .
where's it from?
a song .
what's it about?
mister ... is this heaven here or not?
no ...
but ... it could turn out to be .
you died saturday at 5 p . m .
the prison doctor confirmed ... suicide after an overdose of tranquillizers .
you're buried ... in maisons alfort , row 8 , plot 30 .
titi ...
that's titi !
i work , say ... for the government .
we've decided to give you another chance .
what do i do?
learn .
learn to read , walk , talk , smile and even fight .
learn to do everything .
what for?
to serve your country .
what if i don't want to?
row 8 , plot 30 .
can i sleep a bit before i decide?
i'll be back in an hour .
motherfucker !
where's the way out?
straight ahead .
who're these shits?
employees .
nobody move !
it's ok !
the hell it is !
nothing's ok !
open the door !
i can't open it .
tell them to open the door !
they won't .
i'll blow your brains out .
it's not loaded .
forget it .
get off me !
cool it .
right , get back to your desks .
rule 1 , the first bullet's not for you .
that'll clip your wings .
made your mind up?
that's good .
fill that out .
if i don't make it?
you'll make it .
we'll start with an easy program .
it's like a typewriter keyboard letters and figures .
that's the mouse .
there's a roller under it to move the arrow .
if you press here , you can make drawings .
go on then .
there .
gently .
that's good .
gently .
gently !
bring the arrow back now .
back up to the corner .
bring the arrow back here .
very good .
now press here .
there you go .
again .
these are the firearms we use .
first , the simplest of all ... the beretta 93r , 9mm automatic , 20 shots maximum .
the barrel towards the target .
before learning the correct stance , get to know the tool .
target at 10 m .
used one before?
never on paper .
nice and round .
can't .
my leg hurts .
never mind .
we'll try a reflex exercise .
an easy one .
get ready .
now i've taken up my guard .
i want you to try to hit my face .
next class .
sit down there .
my dear girl ... you don't look much now chewing gum ... but if we work hard together and if fortune smiles on us ... we'll be able to make you into a human being .
an intermediary but necessary step ... before becoming man's perfect complement ... a woman .
do you like it?
can you give me a definition of grace?
i'm not smart .
smile then .
that'll be a good start .
smile when you don't know something .
you won't be any smarter but it's nice for others .
allow yourself to be taken over by the faint fragility ... which will make your face beautiful .
a smile .
a smile ... is surface sweetness .
gentleness .
almost a mood .
shall we fix the wig?
how's it going?
i wish it had gone .
a sense of humor .
that's a good start .
made friends?
i get on well with my mouse .
when do we go for a drink?
not just yet .
no rest in this factory?
never .
that suits you .
i'm going to be 20 next week .
can't i have just a bit of leave ... if you trail me?
how's it going?
i've a great program to try out .
present .
let's open it , huh?
one white mouse ...
ran into my house .
i grabbed its tail and made it wail !
in 3 months , she's screwed everything up .
lost your touch?
she has potential .
potential?
i wonder what for , apart from kicking and biting instructors?
5 ... 6 years maybe .
oh come on .
i'll give you 2 weeks .
after that , she's out .
who are you?
i don't know .
but ...
you are ...
yes ...
what are you doing in my arms?
i don't know .
but now we've got this far ...
maybe it's just a dream .
oh my darling .
you've made progress , especially in dance .
in art too .
but in all the other subjects ...
nix , zilch ... zero .
i'll be right back .
happy birthday .
blow them out .
they've given us 2 weeks .
i can't do any more after .
not a thing .
are you looking at my hands?
they were beautiful once .
now , they give me away .
did you go through this?
let your pleasure be your guide .
your pleasure as a woman .
and don't forget ...
there are two things that have no limit : femininity and the means of taking advantage of it .
i don't believe it !
not ready yet?
you're uptight , amande .
it's five to and i hate unpunctuality .
waiting sharpens the appetite .
put this on .
god , this hanger's ugly .
i have to finish work .
no way !
that'll do !
only for a minute .
you look beautiful .
are we dining?
yes .
and why?

no , marco .
when she was 8 or so .
marco , you promised !
it's him i'm asking , marie , not you .

i love you all the same .
see , she's a brick wall .
so people say .
marie !
at 8 , she was so pretty .
she had golden hair in a pigtail .
there was a cousin called caroline .
only caroline could touch her pigtail .
no one else .
she wore a ribbon ... and always had white dresses .
i only saw her when the family rented a farm in summer .
with the cousins and neighbors , there were 20 kids ... always causing trouble together .
marie had her speciality .
she imitated frogs .
she'd squat by the pond and jump into the mud ... going " croak , croak " .
that cracked the other kids up .
i slipped " , she'd say in her quiet little voice .
that's just like her !
has she told you what i do?
no .
see , i can't ask her questions .
i work in a travel agency .
i'm one of the partners .

marie ...
i know questions piss you off .
i don't know what's up ... what shit you've been through ... to put you in that state .

all sorts : computing , electronics , mechanics ...
who's the girl?
anne marie .
together for 2 years .
she's an art dealer .
seems safe enough .
we're not interested in him .
we're after the companies selling the data ... and to get them , we need proof .
the proof's in the embassy safe?
yeah and the keys are in his pocket .
so we know where to look .
relations are strained .
go easy and don't hurt him .
try to work magic , not havoc .
sweetheart?

a guy who was a pain in the neck even before i carried his stuff .
what'll you drink?
whiskey .

stay here .
give me an hour .
and just calm down .
calm down .
see you in an hour .
you said an hour .
time to clean up .

you're not cleaning anything , victor .
we'll just go for a little drive .
the mission's not over .
please , victor .
i can't take any more of this .
please , let's go !
who's that?
i don't know .
sir?
what's happening , sir?
oh shit !
let's get out of here !
they're ready .
nothing's wrong .
false alert .
calm down .
they've shut the gate .
we can't get out .
we'll call back .

a quick drive and we'll call back .
please stop !
move over .
look at me , marie .
my poor love .
they'll wear you out .
the job's too tough for you .
look at your tiny hands .
they need protecting .
they mustn't get old .
stop before it's too late .
why do you say that?
i know everything , marie .
there never has been a marie clment at your hospital .
i also know about ... the stake outs , the tailings ... the video cassettes .
why didn't you say?
because i love only you .
thank you .
my little marco .
you're the most beautiful person i ever met .
the only one who helped me too .
are you going away?
got a little place for me?
you're better in a big place .
i love you .
mathieu !
i'll go up first .
i'll call if there's trouble .
come to shoot me?
don't you think ... she's paid her dues?
hasn't she the right to live?
her life's been ruined .
i know all that .
but she ruined a life a few years ago .
a policeman's .
those are heavy dues .
she killed for you too .
it only counts when it suits you .
ok , marco , you know what it's all about now .
i'm listening .
what do you want me to do?
protect her .
i'll try ... but she's in danger , marco .
she took the embassy documents .
she's out of danger then .
i've got the documents .
she left you a note ... but i tore it up .
what did it say?
we'll miss her , huh?
yeah .
