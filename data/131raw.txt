why are you here?
i let you touch me , cowboy .
i think i need a bath .
samantha , please .
who's samantha?
where's henessey?
no one told me about her
the way she lied
well , no one told me about her
how many people cried
but it's too late to say you're sorry
how would i know?
why should i care?
please don't bother trying to find her
she's not there
well , let me tell you about the way she looks
the way she acted , the colour of her hair
her voice was soft and cool , her eyes were clear and bright
but she's not there
the lengthening of its neck , it's easier for it to swim .
its front feet are a little bit larger , and that's good , to have these paddlelike feet .
hey , sister , oh , sister , soul sister , go , sister
hey , sister , go , sister , soul sister , go , sister
we met marmalade down in old new orleans ...
hey , mitch !
you're awake .
hey , joe , you want to give it a go?
yitti yitti ya ya da da
uh oh .
you're seeping .
here .
look at this .
ow !
shit !
ohh !
ow .
that hurt like shit .
i know .
that's why i distracted you first .
the same principle as deflowering virgins .
what?
v virg ...
what?
i read it in this harold robbins book .
a guy bites her on the ear , distracts from the pain .
you ever try that?
no .
i sock them in the jaw and yell , " pop goes the weasel " .
who the fuck are you?
the name's charly .
the spy .
nice to meet you .
drink?
yeah .
there have been gunshots , and yes ...
ok .
let's say i buy it .
you are a trained killer .
i can't even say that with a straight face .
so samantha ... she ...
never really existed .
like nathan said , she was a total fabrication .
i made her up .
so now she's just , uh , gone forever and ever?
thank god .
look at my inordinately large ass .
look what she did to me .
pretty convincing act .
i guess .
you know , her personality had to come from somewhere .
change the subject .
better yet , bring me that bottle .
here you go .
drink up .
so , what's next?
what do we do now?
i contact chapter .
i come for debriefing , bury the last 8 years , get back to work .
cheers .
would you believe it , harry?
we got an appropriations review in three weeks , and the president wants to know how i managed to lose an agent .
yes , sir .
you have a call on line 3 , sir .
you going to tell me who it is?
charly baltimore , sir .
run a trace .
this is mr perkins .
turn on the tv .
farmon , new jersey .
seven dead .
charly !
good lord , girl .
we've been looking all over for you .
i got a photo of you in a christmas parade .
what the hell is happening?
don't be stupid .
i completed my assignment .
you mean daedalus?
i shot him .
he's pretty much dead .
actually , i would have done it earlier , like back in '92 , but i was baking .
don't ask .
i want to come in .
sure .
of course .
let me direct you to a safe house .
forget it .
we play it my way .
you want me back , then you stay away .
i'll call you .
those are the rules , understand?
shit .
did you hear that?
if she got to daedalus , she could know about honeymoon .
she might know that old targets have become your new best friends .
that could be trouble .
god damn you .
there were weapons at that farm .
she's armed now !
stop having kittens .
you're the head of a major spy network , and you have a tendency to whine .
do you realise that?
she could compromise this entire operation .
we have 24 hours .
we find her ... then we kill her .
you do whatever it takes , but you be careful .
if it gets out you're working for me ,
i'm going to be grabbing my ankles on the white house lawn .
the lady's whacked , trin .
she's lost it .
i got to get out of here .
i need you to meet me .
i'll sneak out to this phone and call you at midnight with the details , all right?
bye .
all right , sam .
what did that accomplish?
i'm testing our boy perkins .
got a light?
i don't really trust him .
come again?
a little experiment .
if he was looking for me in pennsylvania , he sure as hell tapped your office .
you mean , he just traced that call?
come midnight , you hang by the phone .
if he wants to erase me , he'll send someone to kidnap and torture you for my whereabouts , in which case , i don't trust him .
no , no , no .
time out .
well , hello there
my , it's been a long , long time
i haven't had a date in eight years , mitch .
is this a fun date?
oh , i guess i'm doing fine
what's going on?
true love .
shut the fuck up .
when beautiful ... white ladies seduce someone , call in help .
get real , sweetheart .
i ain't handsome , i ain't rich , and the last time i got blown , candy bars cost a nickel .
what's going on?
chemistry .
chemistry , my ass .
you know what i think?
i think this is why you'd fuck me .
to kill a schoolteacher .
to bury her once and for all .
i kind of liked that schoolteacher .
when she comes back , you give me a call , all right?
and call your fucking kid .
it's two days to christmas .
she might be under the mistaken impression mommy gives a fuck .
i didn't ask for the kid .
samantha had the kid , not me !
nobody asked me !
was born upon this day
to save us all from satan's power
oh , tidings of comfort ...
good evening , pretty lady .
how about some company?
no , thanks .
i'm saving myself till i get raped .
step in the alley .
i ain't asking you .
i'm telling you .
fuck .
god damn it .
you're early .
so perkins wants me dead , huh?
what's the rush?
why don't you just go away and come back at midnight?
shoo .
hey , honey , this is a real big fucking gun .
this ain't no ham on rye , pal .
what the hell are you doing?
saving your life .
i would have been here sooner , but i was thinking up that ham on rye line .
you think i can't take him?
now you scared the other ones away .
what other ones?
head hunters , nimrod .
they don't travel alone .
were you always this stupid , or did you take lessons?
i took lessons .
what? !
what? !
i still got this fucking gun .
fuck this .
put that away .
i'm out of here .
say yeah , yeah , yeah
one look back now , baby
say yeah , yeah , yeah
perkins , you prick .
now you want me dead .
why?
easy , sport .
i got myself out of beirut once .
i think i can get out of new jersey .
yeah?
don't be so sure .
others have tried and failed .
the entire population , in fact .
you keep saying " i " this , " i " that , like , well ...
it's like you don't need me any more .
good point .
say yeah , yeah , yeah
say yeah , yeah , yeah
whoa oh oh whoa

in every way
gonna love you in every way
i'm gonna love you

got my mind made up to love you
found a use for me , huh?
yep .
i'm leaving the country , mitch .
i need a fake passport , and i need money , lots of it .
well , why didn't you say so?
hold on a minute while i pull that out of my ass .

it's got cash and i. d. s in it , mitch .
i need you to get them for me .
shit .
i should have known .
ok .
so where's this charm bracelet?
yeah , well , that's the thing about being a secret agent , mitch .

you stili think i'm warm and fuzzy?
oh , yeah , sure .
anything?
uh ... phone bill , christmas card ...
you know , you could have aimed for those guys 'shoulders .
back off , man .
you know , i'm thinking maybe samantha caine wasn't an act .
yeah , you had amnesia and all , but i think maybe you forgot to hate yourself for a while .
how about it?
what the fuck is that?
hello?
it's me .
i got your kid .
give your location .
don't waste time .
state road 5 , 15 minutes east of union springs , new york .
i don't like cellular phones , so here's how we do this .
go to the holiday inn nearest you .
there's one in cayuga .
be there when i call in 15 minutes .
who?
he's got the kid .
timothy?
he's routing me to a land line .
he doesn't want to talk over the airwaves .
oh , shit !
maybe we can trace him .
trace him?
how?
it's a random hotel .
how long did he give you?
15 minutes .
fuck .
why don't we try the phone company?
think you can get here in under 15 minutes?
nobody move !
you .
you've got 40 seconds to run a patch for me .
everybody up against the wall !
holiday inn .
jet speaking .
i'd like to page charlene baltimore , please .
please hold .
yeah .
hi .
it's me .
no shit .
verify you have the kid .
how else would i get your cellular number?
i got it off the cast on her right wrist , right below " mommy loves you " .
i offer up a simple trade : you for the girl .
i'll tell you where and when .
and , charly , you fuck with me ...
i'll blind the kid and shoot out her knees .
give me an a. n. i. trace .
do it !
how do you know so much about this timothy character?
what do you think?
i bumped pelvises with him .
he was a target , remember?
ma'am?
that call was placed from niagara falls .
niagara falls?
operation honeymoon .
bingo .
perkins .
what's he doing here?
timothy acting alone , we had a chance .
charly's hooked .
all we got to do is set a time and a place .
my god .
we're monsters .
you talk to me about honeymoon .
tanker's ready .
one terrorist on ice waiting to play patsy .
and no loose ends?
no .
no .
not that i can tell .
the feds are going to find them crashed in a ravine five miles from the blast site .
i'm not a complete ogre .
the young one gets a doll to play with for christmas .
oh , fuck you .
i think i should go in first .
negative .
you'd just screw it up .
hey , i'm a much better shot up close .
you couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom .
forget it .
here .
the guards are at 126 . 9 megahertz .
you meet me ... at 127 . 1 if you need to talk .
as soon as you spot me with the kid , you start laying down cover fire .
all right .
they're going to blow my head off , you know .
this is the last time i'll ever be pretty .
northeast sector , all clear .
roger , northeast .
bogey .
round her up , gentlemen .
i want her alive and unmarked .
she's got the kid !
i smell gasoline .
did you have a little accident?
i got plenty of matches up here .
it would be a bad way for a kid to go .
30 seconds .
think it over .
pick him up .
i'm going to miss you , major .
you ought really to have stayed dead .
you don't know the rules of the game any more .
tell me about it .
eight years ago , this guy was on the hit list .
budget cuts , dear .
congress blinded us overseas .
i was forced to turn to any eyes and ears i could find , even if that meant recruiting the " bad guys " here .
budget cuts , is that what this is about?
operation honeymoon ...
fuck me !
you're running a fund raiser .
fund raiser?
1993 ...
world trade center bombing , remember?
during the trial , one of the bombers claimed the cla had advance knowledge .
the diplomat who issued the terrorists 'visa was cla .
it's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing , purely to justify a budget increase .
you're telling me you're going to fake some terrorist thing just to scare some money out of congress?
unfortunately , mr henessey ,
i have no idea how to fake killing 4, 000 people , so we're just going to have to do it for real . it on the muslims ,
then i get my funding .
good night , old girl .
timothy , i'll be in chopper one .
no , no , no .
just her .
sam .
i'll be waiting for you to come rescue me .
be just a minute .
so you plant this poor arab to take the fall .
what's going out in the tanker?
come on .
i'm going to die .
i want to know .
ok .
chemical bomb .
chain reaction .
once started , it can't be stopped .
the catalyst injected into the tanker heats up .
we pull the truck into the centre of town .
it goes critical around midnight .
farewell .
adieu .
bang .
timothy .
yeah?
please ... let my kid go .
i'm about all out of favours , there , chuck .
i'm already letting while you freeze .
now , they'll , uh ...
they'll find your bodies somewhere in pennsylvania .
you're just going to be written off as some crazy mommy who kidnapped her own kid , died with her in a blizzard .
god damn you .
look at her eyes .
why would i want to do that?
because they're yours .
that night with you , i got pregnant .
the little girl is your daughter .
that's priceless .
would you bring my little bitch in here?
caitlin .
hi , princess .

hello , miss caine .
yes , mr president .
i owe you .
the country owes you a debt of tremendous gratitude .
i wonder , would i be out of line if i asked you to come back into government , work for the state department?
out of the question , sir .
i've got a stack of papers to grade .
the money involved would be ... substantial .
oh , you'd be surprised how much a good teacher can earn .
oh , gosh , i know .
and i am working on it , but it's for next term .
before i go , sir , there is a small favour i'd like to ask .
good evening .
welcome to larry king live .
tonight we seek closure in the matter of leland perkins , indicted on six counts of high treason .
joining us tonight is cla section chief walter hodge .
he's in langley , virginia .
at our studios in new york city , intelligence analyst jack e. wadsworth .
and in our studios here tonight is pittsburgh native mitchell henessey , who , at a surprise press conference , was singled out by the president of the united states for his role in this affair .
as the expression goes , " that ain't hay " .
hello , mitch , and thanks for coming .
thank you , mr king , for having me .
mitch , you have had one hell of a christmas eve , and we have heard from our reporter carla krebs , on the scene in niagara falls , that when she first heard this story , she didn't believe it .
well , what carla failed to realise , mr king , is that i'm always frank and earnest with women .
in new york , i'm frank .
in chicago , i'm earnest !
good girl .
