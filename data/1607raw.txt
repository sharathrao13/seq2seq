all these flowers , night after night .

ratkowski , get ravitch !
you're going on !
ravitch !

peace !
a little piece of poland a little piece of france
a little piece of portugal and austria perchance
a little slice of turkey and all that that entails
und then a piece of england scotland lreland and wales
nobody's allowed here during a performance !
a little nip of norway a little spot of greece
a little hunk of hungary oh what a lovely feast
a little bite of belgium and now for some dessert
armenia albania and russia wouldn 't hurt
we're from the foreign office .
we must see bronski .
i'm sorry , sir , but you can't .
he's on stage .
a little piece of poland a little piece of france
a little piece of lndia and pakistan perchance
why did it come down?
i've never been so outraged .
don't look at us !
sondheim !
who brought the curtain down?
i was ordered to .
ordered to !
by whom?
by me .
who are you?
dr. boyarski .
these are my colleagues .
wonderful .
what gives you the right to stop my show?
we are trying to stop a war .
what's that got to do with comedy?
your presentation could be construed as an insult to hitler .
it was meant to be an insult !
lupinski , shut up !
we cannot allow you to ridicule the third reich .
it's too risky .
let me tell you something .
the curtain's going up . . . . . . and we're gonna finish .
we are not backing down !
then we're closing this theatre .
we're backing down .
strike the sets .
thank you , mr. bronski .
let's get on with the next number .
the next number isn't ready yet !
we'll use klotski's klowns .
sondheim !
send in the clowns !
klotski , get ready !
you're going on !
we're still 1 0 minutes short .
what'll we do?
pardon me , a thought .
shakespeare .
i could do my shylock .
shakespeare .
great idea , lupinski .
one little change .
you don't do shylock .
i do hamlet .
hamlet?
what a wonderful idea .
i heard that .
oy , the comedian gets to play hamlet .
and me , a serious actor , gets to play the first off stage nazi .
he did everything .
oh , good !
mutki , mama's baby !
" naughty nazis " is out?
foreign office says it's offensive .
what's gonna take its place?
bronski's gonna do his hamlet .
and that's not offensive?
offensive , yes .
but convenient .
what do you mean?
while he's busy with his soliloquy . . . . . . our gorgeous young flier could wing his way backstage .
are you suggesting i have a rendezvous with lieutenant what's his name . . . . . . while my husband's out on stage?
yes .
all right .
but remember , you said it .
ladies and gentlemen .
there has been a change in the program .
tonight you will be honored by frederick bronski's world famous . . . . . .
highlights from hamlet .
yes .
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it . . . . . . than is my deed to my most painted word .
o heavy burthen !
i hear the handsome young prince coming .
let us withdraw , my lord .
to be . . .
or not to be .
. . . or not to be .
excuse me .
that . . .
pardon me . . . . is the que  excuse me . que . . . question .
pardon me .
whether 'tis nobler in the mind . . .
excuse me . . . . to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune .
pardon me .
or to take arms against a sea of troubles . . . . . . and by opposing , end them?
what happened?
he's good tonight .
i can't believe it .
i'm actually sitting here with you .
you're anna bronski .
yes , i am .
you're the one who's been sending flowers .
they're expensive .
you shouldn't .
it's okay .
my father's a florist .
and that must be mutki .
hello , mutki .
oh , you know his name .
i know everything about you .
i've read every word written on anna bronski .
how's kishka?
who?
kishka , your canary .
oh , kishka , my canary .
i have some very bad news for you .
the cat got him .
moska?
who?
moska , your cat?
yes .
moska , my cat .
yes , yes .
moska ate kishka .
i'm sorry to hear that .
i love that picture of you on the farm .
you behind the plow .
by the way , where was that?
in the chronicle .
no , where's the farm?
oh , the farm !
that's out of town somewhere .
that's where they keep them .
oh , but that's enough talk about me .
let's talk about you .
how'd you like me in the first act?
i thought you were sensational .
oh !
flatterer .
i bet you have girls chasing you .
no , i don't .
you chase them?
well , actually , i believe that you really only fall in love once .
and when you do , you should dedicate your whole life to that person .
yes , i totally agree .
but on the other hand . . . . . . i've always felt that love should never stand in the way of a good time .
how about you?
i do like to have fun .
you do?
what do you do for fun?
i fly a bomber .
that's fun?
yes !
there's nothing like it .
i climb into the cockpit , the engines start to rev up , i'm in another world .
they sputter .
they hum .
then they thunder .
the plane moves forward , taxiing down the runway slowly .
faster , till the world becomes a blur , rushing by at incredible speed .
my tail starts to rise .
the roar of the engines becomes deafening .
the plane shakes , pushing with all its might to break free .
then i'm off the ground !
thrusting upward , upward into the sky .
flying higher and higher until i feel i can touch the sun .
would you like to see my bomber?
yes !
forgive me .
i got carried away .
you're not the only one .
it's getting late in denmark .
you must go .
i have to change .
when can i see you again?
oh , dear , i don't know .
i don't know .
he's doing hamlet tomorrow night .
how about tomorrow night?
great !
great !
same time?
i don't know .
all right .
mrs. bronski .
anna , may l . . .?
yes?
yes?
may i kiss you good night?
of course .
gee , thanks a lot .
oh , he's an animal !
listen , honey
are you all right?
i'm fine .
then why are you on the floor?
the floor?
i'm on the floor?
get me up .
i still can't believe what happened last night .
i can't believe it .
bronski , will you please stop? !
gets up and walks right out .
did it happen before?
no .
all right .
it happened last night , it'll never happen again .
o heavy burthen !
i hear the handsome young prince coming .
let us withdraw , my lord .
to be . . .
. . . or not to be .
that is the question .
excuse me .
whether 'tis no
no . . . .
excuse me .
pardon me .
no ! bler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows . . . . . . of outrageous fortune .
or to take arms against a sea of . . . .
a sea of . . . .
a sea of . . .
troubles !
ow ! . . . troubles . . . .
enter andre sobinski .
exit sasha kinski .
won't you sit down , lieutenant?
there isn't time .
what?
mrs. bronski .
anna , my squadron has been put on alert .
i've done something that i hope you won't think is too bold .
i'm sure it isn't .
good .
i've written a letter to your husband , telling him how we feel .
you what?
it's the decent and honorable thing .
and a stupid thing .
you're right .
that is stupid .
i'm glad you changed your mind .
i should've followed my first instinct .
what was that?
to be a man .
to tell him in person .
andre , let's think this out .
if we tell him now , all we'll do is hurt him .
i know what you're feeling and what i'm feeling .
if those feelings grow , if they get deeper . . . . . . and we find ourselves hopelessly in love . . . . . . then we'll hurt him .
i'll tell him now .
listen to me .
anna , it's war .
war?
let me see that .
german troops crossed the polish border at several points today .
i've gotta get back to my squadron .
people are gonna kill each other .
andre .
goodbye , anna .
andre , come back .
don't worry , i will .
i have to see you again .
goodbye .
goodbye .
that poor boy .
all of them .
anna , have you heard?
it seems impossible , doesn't it?
does the audience know?
no .
let's make an announcement .
stabbed in the back .
i don't believe it .
i don't believe it .
i know , i know .
isn't it terrible?
terrible?
it's more than terrible .
it's the worst thing that's ever happened .
it's the end .
no .
it isn't .
it just mustn't be .
that man , i hate him !
i hate him too .
everybody hates him .
all europe hates him .
they should .
i mean , two nights in a row !
two nights in a row?
what are you talking about?
he walked out on me again !
bronski , bronski !
can't you forget about you for one minute?
my god , war .
what's happening?
what's going on?
we've been invaded .
this could be the end of poland .
this is bad too .
air raid !
mutki .
everybody to the cellar !
to the cellar !
a bomb !
ka boom .
oy , oy , oy !
what's going on?
all right .
don't panic .
you'll get your costume .
it's war !
the germans are bombing us .
hurry up .
come on .
hurry up !
is everybody here?
what did we do to them?
nothing .
we don't have to do anything .
poland , the doormat of europe .
everybody steps on us .
if it isn't the russians , it's the germans .
listen .
i wish we could do something .
what can we do?
we'll do what a theatrical company should do .
we'll hide till it's over .
warsaw is almost leveled as the luftwaffe relentlessly pounds ... ... the polish capital into rubble .
a stunned poland unprepared for the mighty german war machine ... ... is brought to its knees in less than three weeks .
poland surrenders but the fiight is carried on from england ... ... by the polish squadron of the r. a. f.
forgive me , but just hearing that song took me back to warsaw .
my regret is that i'm too old to do the splendid things . . . . . . that you brave young men do for poland .
professor siletski , your radio speeches on the voice of free poland ... . . . are worth a thousand bombs .
thank you , but i won't be doing them again for a while .
why is that?
you see , i'm leaving for
i'm going on a little trip .
where to , professor?
thank you for the fine supper and wonderful songs .
it's a secret mission .
please .
you're going to poland , aren't you?
are you going to krakw?
i can't tell you any more .
i shouldn't have mentioned it .
you didn't .
we coerced you .
my wife's in krakw .
if you could
i understand , but i cannot jeopardize the purpose of my trip .
not one of us would mention a word
all right .
if i can't trust you , whom can i trust?
write down the names and addresses of your people and i'll do what i can .
my family got out of poland , but there's someone still in warsaw .
can you handle a delicate matter?
is there a lady involved?
exactly .
you want to contact her?
without her husband knowing .
that is delicate .
what is the message?
just say , " to be or not to be . " she'll understand .
in code?
and the lady's name is mrs. . .?
believe it or not , it's anna bronski .
let me write all that down .
to be or not to be .
what did you say the lady's name was?
anna bronski .
b r o n s k i , is that correct?
you've never heard of anna bronski?
should i have?
you said you lived in warsaw .
oh , yes , yes , the name is familiar .
familiar?
she's famous !
oh , that anna bronski !
what was i thinking?
of course .
can you read this?
my brother's with the underground .
with the underground?
brave .
my cousin's in the underground .
what's his name?
nobody from warsaw could not know anna bronski .
something is wrong , and i thought it was my duty to inform you .
siletski already left .
he's due in sweden .
how'd you know he was leaving?
he told us he was going to warsaw .
he told you?
that's why we gave him the names and addresses .
what?
of whom?
people in the underground .
he wrote them down?
yes , sir .
if he isn't stopped , we've sentenced the polish underground to death .
how is he getting to warsaw?
by boat , then by train .
lieutenant , how long would it take you to fly to warsaw?
seven hours .
it's imperative that list never falls into the gestapo's hands .
take this .
find him and kill him .
i will , sir .
coming up on the jump site , sir .
good luck .
now !
three hundred years to build a city and in three weeks they wreck it .
heil hitler .
where's bronski?
at the german censorship board . . . . . . trying to convince them shakespeare wasn't jewish .
shakespeare wasn't jewish?
go figure .
hold it , gruba .
he's coming .
whoa !
thanks , dobish .
mr. bronski , i could talk to you?
what is it?
who's this?
my cousin , rifka .
she was bombed out .
she's a jew .
she has nowhere to go .
could i keep her downstairs with me?
all right .
keep it quiet .
thank you , mr. bronski .
who are they?
you expect her to leave a husband and son behind?
you crazy?
i must be .
all right , go inside .
thank you , mr. bronski .
thank you .
mr. bronski , i've got a notice for you from the gestapo .
the gestapo?
yeah .
what?
they're turning my house into gestapo headquarters .
they are?
no , they're not .
they cut off my gasoline , closed my bank account , took my stickpin .
took my pinkie ring and the top of my gold cane .
but they are not , i repeat , not taking my house .
never !
got everything?
everything .
everything they're allowing us to take .
good .
excuse me .
you're sitting in col. erhardt's chair .
forgive me , i have a rotten memory .
ten minutes ago , it was my chair .
fifteen years we've lived in this house .
come , sweetheart , come .
let's go .
don't look back .
don't look back .
just one more to go .
sasha , we can't thank you enough for taking us in .
oh , think nothing of it .
my house is your house .
here we are .
voil .
your new home .
oh , sasha , it's so . . . .
it's it's it's  it's a rathole .
don't you dare call this place a rathole .
he's sharing everything he has .
it's charming .
i love it .
oh , we're gonna be very happy here .
forgive me .
i'm not myself .
come on , let's get the rest of the things .
oh , mutki , we're living in a rathole .
stay back .
who is it?
what do you want?
it's sobinski , let me in .
oh , " to be or not to be . " i must see anna .
where do they live?
you know that beautiful house on posnan street?
don't go there .
they don't live there anymore .
it's gestapo headquarters .
where do they live?
they moved in with sasha .
kubelski st. , number 52 .
kubelski st. , number 52 .
thank you .
oh !
ow !
why are you getting dressed?
i'm going out .
what the hell's that pink thing?
haven't you heard?
the latest fashion in occupied poland .
jews wear yellow stars .
homosexuals wear pink triangles .
oh , sasha !
how awful for you .
i hate it .
it clashes with everything .
they're rounding up jews .
are they?
no , not yet .
so far , so good .
when are you coming back?
don't wait up .
i've got a date . . . . . . with another triangle .
are you my precious little sweet potato , and are you hungry?
is your little belly hungry?
sweetheart , come .
here we go .
andre !
come in .
anna .
how did you get here?
parachute .
you parachuted in to see me?
you could've been killed .
you mad , impetuous , romantic darling .
foolish boy , you shouldn't have .
i didn't .
oh .
i was sent by british lntelligence .
british lntelligence?
i've got to stop a dangerous man .
who?
what?
his name is professor siletski .
on radio?
the voice of free poland?
he is a traitor .
a german agent .
he's coming with a list of everyone in the polish underground .
if he reaches the gestapo , every person on that list will die .
where is he?
he arrives by train tomorrow morning .
how are you gonna stop him?
i don't know .
right now , i can't think .
i'm exhausted .
you must get some rest .
i didn't mean to get you involved .
i had nowhere to go .
german patrols are everywhere .
can i sleep on your sofa?
no .
what?
you take the bed .
what about your husband?
he'll take the sofa .
here , get out of those wet things .
what about you?
i'll wait for bronski .
if he finds you in that bed without an explanation . . . . . . we'll all be doing " highlights from othello .
i better get dressed .
here , 52 .
may i help you , gentlemen?
anna bronski?
yes .
come with us .
why?
i haven't done anything .
just come along .
please .
i'll get my coat .
206 .
please .
good evening , mrs. bronski .
i am professor siletski .
siletski?
is something wrong?
no .
i'm curious to know why i was brought here .
i'll come to the point .
i'm going to read something to you .
i want you to tell me what it means .
" to be or no to be . " hamlet .
act 3 , scene 1 .
is this a theatre quiz?
not quite .
this message was sent to you from england .
we thought it might have another , more secret meaning .
more secret?
oh , more secret meaning .
yes , a more secret meaning .
yes , it does .
it does .
it means , and i hope it won't go any further than this room
you see , my husband is that great polish actor , frederick bronski .
who?
he's world famous in poland .
his favorite soliloquy is , " to be or not to be .
he takes 1 0 minutes to get through it .
i thought that might be a good time to invite this young flier backstage .
just to chat , nothing more .
well , he turned out to be quite intelligent and humorous and . . . . . . tall .
well , i begin to understand .
this is just a secret love code between you and your young lieutenant .
well . . . .
well , i am relieved .
i apologize for having brought you here .
you see
forgive me .
siletski .
hello , colonel erhardt .
absolutely .
thanks for sending the plane to sweden .
the train takes forever .
oh , yes , yes .
i have the list .
good , 1 0 : 00 tomorrow at gestapo headquarters unless i hear from you .
yes .
i am looking forward to meeting you too .
heil hitler .
i won't keep you any longer .
thank you for , " to be or not to be .
wait .
it seems i have the night off .
why don't you stay and have dinner with me?
we representatives of the third reich can be quite charming on occasion . . . . . . if given half a chance .
perhaps i could convince you to join our cause .
i'd love to have dinner with you , professor .
but just as you'd like to present germany in the best light . . . . . . i'd like to plead the polish case dressed in something more special .
of course .
hurry back .
may l?
you're drooling .
thank you .
this lady is permitted to leave .
this is a difficult place to get into , but even more difficult to get out of .
au revoir .
i kiss your hand . . .
. . . for now .
sweetheart , sweetheart , sweetheart .
so many hours with those nazi censors !
and there's some more bad news .
they want us to cut out the gypsy number .
it seems they don't like gypsies either .
let's face it , sweetheart . . . . . . without jews , fags and gypsies , there is no theatre .
i know , i know .
that's what i told them .
but there's nothing , nothing they're gonna do about it .
i'm so tired .
so tired .
sweetheart , i'm so tired .
you feel good .
when this war's over , i'm gonna get you everything you need .
you need a coat .
you need a dress .
you need shoes .
and you need a shave .
a shave?
to be or not to be .
excuse me .
pardon me .
excuse me .
pardon me .
talk , and talk fast .
who the hell are you?
andre .
your voice !
andre .
anna .
what is andre doing in my bed?
siletski's here .
where?
he's here?
how?
he came by plane .
you sure?
i was just with him .
what?
and i'm going back .
good .
good?
who are you?
sobinski .
sobinski?
then who's solinski?
siletski .
a spy .
i heard him talking with erhardt , the head of the gestapo .
siletski has that list .
he'll take it to the gestapo tomorrow , or tonight .
what are you talking about?
what do i do?
keep siletski there .
he mustn't get to erhardt with the list .
if he's dangerous , why send her back?
somebody's got to stop him .
wait a minute .
siletski and erhardt haven't met .
if we find someone to play erhardt . . . .
a good actor .
a great actor .
a dead actor .
don't look at me .
don't look at me .
look at me !
i'll never get away with this .
who'd believe i'm erhardt?
that this is gestapo headquarters?
the flags !
give me hitler .
relax .
siletski's never met erhardt .
he doesn't know what he looks like .
if we all play our parts properly , he'll never suspect a thing .
me my moe !
dobish !
let's rehearse the scene .
all right .
heil hitler .
heil hitler .
all right , i've got it .
it took longer than i thought .
i hope the effect was worth it .
it was definitely worth it .
i would die for the fhrer any time , except for the next few hours .
come , my dear .
shall we go?
go?
where?
what?
i've booked a table at ladow's .
it's getting late .
the gestapo won't be calling anymore tonight .
ladow's .
what a lovely surprise .
oh , a piano !
i haven't seen one in ages .
and with keys !
and it works .
come , my dear .
i'm afraid we're running
you and the night and the music
fill me with flaming desire
setting my being completely
on fire
the flags .
don't forget the flags !
hurry up .
we're late .
you drive like an understudy .
i won't take that from you .
will you stop?
how long can anna keep him there?
sweetheart sweetheart
sweetheart
heart and soul i fell in love with you heart and soul
the way a fool would do madly
because you held me tight and stole a kiss in the night
darling , your little recital is over .
time to go .
but i wasn't finished .
yes , you were .
are we mad?
are we insane?
what are we doing?
we're going out to a noisy restaurant . . . . . . when we could dine here , in this beautiful hotel suite .
professor siletski's room .
206 .
who may i announce?
we will announce ourselves .
button your collar .
yes , sir .
why don't we call room service?
this is german military headquarters .
there is no room service .
then why don't we just skip dinner?
yes .

i'll get my staff started on these .
i'll send the duplicate to berlin in the morning .

i must get back to the hotel .
there's someone waiting for me .
how is anna bronski?
how did you?
the gestapo knows everything .
sit .
tell me about her .
i had official questions to ask , and i discovered that she was good company .
good company?
hasn't she got a husband?
isn't she married to that famous actor frederick bronski?
you've seen him?
no .
oh .
what does that matter?
she not only has a husband , she has a lover .
she does?
yes , a certain lt. sobinski .
they have a secret love code .
whenever her silly husband was on stage emoting , " to be or not to be " . . . . . . that was the signal for their backstage rendezvous .
i knew it !
we at the gestapo know everything .
so they call me " concentration camp " erhardt?
back to mrs. bronski .
why don't we forget her?
yes , why don't we?
she's just a cheap , common , promiscuous little
i think i know what you mean .
i know , mr. bronski .
now , up with your hands .
i don't know if you ever played a corpse . . . . . . but you'll be one unless you do as i say .
tell your friends at the door to clear away from there .
i won't do it .
get up against that wall .
you're a pole .
how do you live with yourself?
turn around !
no .
i wanna see it coming .
i don't have to see it coming .
goodbye , mr. bronski .

put it in here .
oh , sugarplum , i'm so glad you're okay .
don't " sugarplum " me , save it for lieutenant sobinski .
what did you do with siletski's body?
never mind siletski's body .
what did you do with sobinski's body?
how can you ask that at a time like this?
schultz is ready to take you to erhardt , who's head of the gestapo .
the gestapo , i forgot .
i don't think i can do it .
i can't get away with it .
yes , you can .
you can and you will !
you're a great actor .
you even look like siletski .
big nose , beady eyes .
you'll be a better siletski than him .
i hope so , he's dead .
beady eyes?
sorry , sweetheart .
goodbye .
bye .
freddy .
good luck .
if i don't come back alive . . . . . . i forgive you for what happened between you and sobinski .

i thought you'd react like that .
what?
nothing .
brandy?
no , thanks .
brandy .
that reminds me of a funny story going around warsaw .
a story about our fhrer .
how does it go?
oh , yes , they named a brandy after napoleon .
they made a herring out of bismarck .
and hitler will end up as a pickle .
a pickle?
yes , because he is such a sourpuss .
that's not funny .
the fhrer won't find it funny .
do you think it's funny?
no !
i hate it .
please , professor .
now , professor , what about the underground movement?
yes , the underground movement .
well , let's get down to details .
yes , let's .

revanski .
stephan revanski?
yes .
you don't have to worry about him .

. . . and nobody saw it .
where is sasha?
of all days not to show
hide me !
they're putting homosexuals into concentration camps .
i have a list of lovely things
that make my life complete
and at the top you'll fiind the thing
that makes my poor heart beat
it isn 't money or power or a castle rising in spain
it's a simple word that you've often heard
but let me repeat it again
that word is " iadies
those wonderful ladies
those fabulous ladies
they're driving me wild
i'm talkin 'ladies
all ages of ladies
from 20s to 80s
they've got me beguiled
out of the way .
i love those ladies
those glamorous ladies
over amorous ladies
they're simply divine
i don 't care if i'm headed for heaven or headed for ... ... hades
as long as there's ladies
oh ladies be mine
i told you there was no one in there .
you invade poland , warsaw , and now my dressing room .
you people are compulsive invaders .
he loves the ladies they smell ofperfume
those wonderful ladies they light up a room
those fabulous ladies soft and sweet as a rose
they're driving him wild in or out of their clothes
i'm talkin 'ladies
i certainly am those heartbreaking ladies
those breathtaking ladies
they've got me beguiled
he calls us ladies but there's one that's the best
his glamorous ladies stands out from the rest
over amorous ladies here's the one that i mean
she's a princess no no she's a queen
so ... ... although the lucilles and the sallys and susies and ... ... sadies
may be beautiful ladies
this lady's my queen
what are you doing?
help me , they're after me .
get him !
no !
wait a minute !
we're doing a show here .
he's under arrest .
just a moment .
you made a mistake .
he's a performer !

wait a minute .
i am anna bronski , and this is my friend .
take him away !
oh , sasha .
anna !
sasha !

this theatre is closed .
everyone must leave at once !
why am i being taken to gestapo headquarters?
my orders are to bring you to erhardt .
that's all i can say .
chief of police keeps me waiting an hour and a half .
then comes in and says , " nobody knows where they're holding sasha .
i used to command respect to this city
what's that?
the gestapo arrested anna .
she's at erhardt's office .
my god !
i've got to get her out .
are you crazy?
you walk in with a gun , they'll shoot you down .
she's my wife .
if there's any , " i'll get her out , " those are my lines .
how are you gonna do it?
i don't know .
let me think .
let me think !
siletski !
i can play him again .

mrs. bronski .
ah , mrs. bronski , mrs. bronski .
we're all here .
so happy you could come .
i am colonel erhardt .
won't you sit down?
forgive me for calling you on short notice .
i'm taking advantage of the fact that we have a mutual friend .
siletski .
in that case i'm puzzled , colonel erhardt .
why am i under arrest?
arrest?
get out .
no , i brought you here because i have some wonderful news for you .
tonight , you and your theatre company will perform for the fhrer .
he's paying a surprise visit to warsaw .
what a great honor .
we really don't deserve it .
besides , we can't do it .
you can't?
no .
our theatre's been closed .
it's boarded up .
who closed it?
the gestapo .
excuse me .
schultz !
what idiot gave the order to close the bronski theatre?
you did , sir .
open it up immediately .
and stop blaming everything that goes wrong on me !
but , colonel , i was only obeying all i was doing heil hitler .
heil hitler !
he gets out of everything with that heil hitler .
mrs. bronski , i had the pleasure of seeing you on the stage once .
you're even more beautiful in person .
would it be too forward of me . . . . . . to propose a champagne supper after the performance this evening?
i'd love to .
but i'm already having a candlelight dinner with siletski .
any chance we could have supper after dinner?
i'm sorry .
i never sup after i dine .
oh .
i don't want to take advantage of our new friendship .
but when they closed our theatre , they arrested my dresser .
since i'm going to perform tonight , do you think he could be released?
what is his name?
sasha kinski .
sasha kinski?
yes .
he's being held downstairs .
he's set for transfer tomorrow .
what does that mean?
you better find a new dresser .
excuse me .
what? !
murdered?
you sure it is his body?
positive identification .
this is terrible .
terrible !
mrs. bronski , please .
sit down .
i'm afraid l i'm afraid i have very bad news for you .
your friend , our friend , siletski , has been killed .
he's dead .
his body was found in a trunk .
well . . . .
i guess you're free for dinner tonight .
it's a bit of a shock .
i'm still a little upset .
naturally , naturally .
forgive me .
this is an emergency .
siletski's on the phone .
good .
what?
professor siletski?
did you tell him he was dead?
no .
good .
hello , professor siletski .
it's good to hear your voice .
how are you?
how are you feeling?
he's alive?
no , he's still dead .
this is obviously an imposter .
i can see you in 20 minutes .
is that good for you , professor siletski?
fine .
we'll be waiting for you .
i must run , there's so much to do .
i'm so sorry .
see you later .
right after the show .
yes .
ah !
schultz !
about professor siletski .
let's prepare a surprise for him .
as soon as he comes , let's get a whole

good .
no , wait !
the beard , it's coming loose .
oh , god , you're right .
i'm gonna take a spare .
you never know .
just in case .
sobinski , look .
if something goes wrong . . . . . . i don't blame you for falling in love with her .
it's easy .
good luck .
no !
don't say that , it's bad luck .
what do you say to say good luck?
you say , " break a leg .
break a leg !
what happened?
i tripped .
i almost broke a leg .
don't say , " break a leg " anymore .
good luck .
thank you , thank you .
goodbye .
professor siletski .
heil hitler !
heil hitler .
how's the professor?
fine .
how's the colonel?
excellent .
pity you didn't get here sooner .
you just missed madam bronski .
she's gone?
she went to the theatre .
they're doing a show for your friend , the fhrer .
oh !
i'll be going too .
would you wait in my office?
i have a few matters to take up with these men .
then we'll get to you .
if it's not too much trouble .
no , no trouble at all .
no , no trouble .
no trouble .
no trouble .
trouble .
don't move .
i'll be right back .
good .
he should've cracked by now .
patience !
give him time to think .
this is the intellectual approach .
what if he isn't an intellectual?
they'll break every bone in his body .
excuse me .
i tried to open a conversation with your friend .
he seems to be slightly dead .
no !
really?
let's go and see .
you're very observant , professor .
he is dead .
have you observed he looks a little bit like you?
he's a dead ringer for me .
or versa vice a .
obviously , one of us is an imposter .
obviously .
it looks bad for me .
doesn't look good .
did you know him?
never met him .
you must have observed him for months .
it takes that long to grow a beard .
good !
yes , schultz .
i might be wearing a false beard .
very funny .
a clever agent like you wearing a false beard .
maybe he's wearing a false beard .
why don't you convince yourself?
why don't you pull his beard?
all right , i will .
i can't do it .
too sensitive?
you can murder a man in cold blood , but you can't pull his beard?
ah !
ooh , ooh , ooh . . . .
good work .
i can't wait to see the fhrer's face when i tell him .
schultz , you put me in this position !
you yourself gave the order .
shifting your responsibility again?
all you ever do is shift !
but , colonel !
get out .
all of you .
professor . . . .
i don't know how to apologize .
what can i do to make up for this?
there is something .
yes , anything .
mrs. bronski is performing .
it would be wonderful to release her dresser .
impossible !
he's scheduled for transport .
remember , i'm seeing the fhrer .
who knows what we'll talk about !
no schultz !
release the sissy .
which sissy?
the one from the bronski theatre .
bring him here .
i knew it was you .
i had to satisfy the curiosity of those dummkopfs .
to put your mind at rest , would you like to pull my beard?
please , professor .
don't rub it in .
i'm sorry .
where is erhardt's office?
you can't go in there .
arrest him !
wait !
silence !
i'm general von seidelman , head of the fhrer's safety squad .
i arrived this morning and in one hour , i discover a plot against him .
can't i rely on anybody?
general
he's an imposter .
shut up .
i will not .
are you blind?
any fool can see he's wearing a false beard .
you didn't even pull on it .
what do you have to say?
i
who is this?
a prisoner .
i was going to release him in the imposter's custody
i'll take charge myself .
there will be a reorganization here .
believe me , heads will roll .
you will hear from me .
you haven't heard the last of this .
schultz !
remember , we've gotta be convincing .
the dress circle will be protected by hitler's guard .
if they suspect anything , they'll shoot first and ask questions later .
be certain hitler's in his box before the diversion .
and i am the diversion .
all your life you've wanted to play shylock .
please , be wonderful .
don't worry , i can do it .
with a little luck , tomorrow night . . . . . . we'll all be in england .
me too?
of course , you too .
and them?
what them?
this them .
what's going on here?
we started with three .
what are they , jews or rabbits?
how can we take them?
how can we leave them?
all right , we'll take them .

what does he want from us?
aren't we human?
silence , jew .
let him speak .
hath not a jew eyes?
hath not a jew hands?
organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions?
fed with the same food .
hurt with the same weapons .
subject to the same diseases .
if you prick us , do we not bleed?

if you poison us , do we not die?
and if you wrong us . . . . . . shall we not revenge?
silence !
bring this man to my headquarters .
i want to question him myself .
you were wonderful .
