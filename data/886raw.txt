carmen
i don't know much , but i know that the innocent don't control this world ...
we'll go on , if possible .
i'm not scared , but it's because i never could ... ... never knew how to ... ... get involved .
i have to run .

i'm the girl , who shouldn't be called carmen .
when shit's worth money , the poor won't have assholes .

badly seen , badly said .
you worked hard today !
that's very good .

you might get a fever yet .
if i put my finger in your ass , and you count to 33 ...
see?
do , re , mi , fa , sol ...
see?
i'll have a fever .
why did you say that?
people don't do what they feel like these days .
i feel like saying it , so i do .
will i get a fever?
maybe .
to be ...
to be ...
in other words ...
mr. godard's room? ... in order to abolish ignorance and crime , must i rage like a storm and sow evil at random?
a lousy idea !
a good idea !
it's time your madness saw the opposite of all things !
we'll write to you .
where am i?
who is this?
don't you remember me?
carmen .
you're elizabeth's daughter?
yes .
won't you ask why i'm here?
sure .
it could provide dialogue .
i need your help , uncle jean .
it was long ago , ... ... the last vacation .
long ago .
young people are crazy !
they have great memories , but they forget anything !
they're in a black hole .
do you really live here now?
no .
not really .
it's not easy .
i have to get sick every week .
so , you need my help ...
that's new !
but this time i mean it .
i do .
her great beauty had already struck me ...
her gentleness , her honesty ...
no matter where or when , the classics always work .
do you still own the apartment in trouville?
of course .
it's paid up until ... the year 2000 .
may i use it?
sure .
what for?
it's quite empty , you know .
some friends and i are making a movie .
then it's yes?
i met a rich guy .
he wants to see some tests .
so i thought ... ... we could shoot them there .
the story takes place by the sea .
is it yes?
does the story end happily?
we don't know yet .
yes , you do .
no !
don't bug me .
you never got along with her .
with whom?
with your mother , like that electra kid ...
you don't remember .
you have a talent for doom .
how did it end , when ... ... the guilty ones in one corner , the innocent in another?
i don't know .
so , is it yes?
i'll lend you my new camera .
it makes music , i built it here ... ... with the kitchen staff .
don't you want to go back to making movies , uncle jean?
we should close our eyes , not open them .
you could help us with your video equipment .
there's tons of money to be made .
shall i ask my friend?
let's wait and see .
but can i borrow the apartment?
who'll give me the keys?
the gardener or his wife .
she does the cleaning .
you said it was empty .
so?
i'll keep you posted .
he's agreed .
it's not a good idea .
it is .
we wanted perfect timing .
right .
but we're improvising !
clara makes too many mistakes .
i'm aware of it .
i realize it , fully .
life isn't the greatest good .
of all evils , mistakes are the worst .
hi claire .
where is my brother?
he went to buy cigarettes .
is it really for me?
why?
it's cold , isn't it?
tell him about saturday ...
you tell him !
my sister's invited you for dinner on saturday .
i can't .
i have a training session .
he should change jobs !
you should .
i told my father will get you another job .
i'll take claire home , then i'll drop you off .
coffee break !
if anything's not normal , call me .
what's not normal?
everything !
be more mysterious ...
the chord shorter?
no , it develops and there it becomes more tragic ...
the second violin and the alto must be louder ...
we'll take it from d ...
move on , goddammit !
can i have your autograph?
aren't you jean gabin?
you look just like him .
video , who wants cassettes?
will you keep moving !
all films in all colors !
pal , secam ... all videos .
keep moving !
shit !
freeze !
everyone out !
down there !
hurry !
see you in the hall .
out of my way !
it must be more violent .
once more .
the tempo was a bit slack .
don't fade so soon ...
the phrase on which you fade is very long ...
right .
act , don't ask .
perform miracles , before you reveal them .
it's the only way to fulfill your destiny .
let's get out of here .
let's leave .
i'll tie you up , it'll look more real .
the keys !
give her the keys !
they're in the ignition .
same place?
nothing's changed .
untie me .
if i want to .
will you , when i love you?
i'll be tied up , then .
untie me , i have to piss !
good , so do i.
then let's go .
go on !
the first phrase built on the harmony ...
you have quite a chest ...
maybe .
sorry ...
were you able to phone?
out of my way !
sorry .
no ...
i'm sorry .
what's the matter?
i'll explain .
i can't ask for more .
soldier boy ...
i'll look for something to eat .
he's really nuts .
there's a tape recorder in the fridge .
i'm sorry .
it's really empty .
who owns this place?
scram !
no .
grab me .
yeah !
what do you want?
now?
how about you?
what do i want?
in life?
to show people what a woman does with a man .
with a man?
what she says to him?
no , not at all .
what she does to a man .
i lived here once .
it belongs to one of my uncles .
i must have been 13 or 14 ...
that was the living room ...
this was his room .
his room ...
we're going to make a movie , some pals and i.
really?
yes ... a documentary .
we're not sure yet , but ...
that's why you held up a bank?
later , later ...
when my friends get here , i'll explain .
i'll phone again tommorow .
then i'll explain ...
there's no rush .
move ...
no .
explain it now .
what if i told you to get lost?
no .
you're attracted to me .
yes .
maybe ... ... i am , too .
one , two ...
higher ...
enough ...
draw it out ...
vibrato ...
go ahead , stupid ...
gently ... gently !
so it goes .
why do women exist?
ready , claire .
fate , show your power !
we're not our own masters .
what has been determined ... ... must be .
so be it .
now i know ....
what?
jail ... ... why it is called " the hole "?
why?
why?
everything shakes ...
what did you say?
i didn't hear .
everything shakes ...
the earth ...
the house ...
me .
maybe ...
... my ass also shakes ...
you already have a woman's behind .
check everything ... ... in the evening .
and the clouds ...
... the clouds ... ... will they reveal ...
... torrents of life?
will you write to me , when i'm in jail?
you won't go .
nothing's lost .
wou'll write to me?
and you?
me ... ... actually i have no friends , male or female .
i know one girl , but she's too special .
loneliness forced me to be my own best friend .
i really thought you wouldn't untie me .
i haven't had that kind of scare in ages .
you went to college?
not really .
were your parents too poor , or didn't you want to?
they were too poor , and i didn't want to go .
why?
telling you why would take all day .
i have to figure myself out , first .
get it?
i get it .
jacques only hires college kids .
but i'll try ...
but then ... you've been a cop .
how else would we have met?
that's just it ...
you have a young girl's behind ...
a woman's too .
you know , joe ... joseph
i'm warning you ...
if i love you ... ... that's the end of you .
yes , carmen .
what's it called?
what?
something about ... ... the innocent ones on one side ... ... the guilty ones on the other , ...
and ... i don't know ...
neither do i.

society?
you mean big business !
establishment funds !

he did right .

it's in all of us ...
such violence is a kind of peace ...
ok , i'll tell you ... we're going to kidnap a guy .
kidnap?
yes , a wealthy businessman .
on fridays and saturdays he gambles here at the casino .
it's either him , or his daughter .
why not both?
there aren't enough of us .
we're only 4 people .

is he in the film business?
no ... the movie was my idea .
i said let's do like dillinger .
i read it in a comoc strip ...
he held up a bank , pretending to be making a movie ...
so ... with this video craze nowdays ... ... that seemed to be the thing to do .
then i thought of my uncle .
he's a famous film director .
he's all washed up now , he's sick ...
i don't know what's wrong with him .
i visited him at the hospital .
i said we'd finance a movie for him .
he was in love with me when i was a kid ...
at least ...
i think ...
i was his favourite relative .
he wanted me to be in his films .
but i didn't want to .
lunch time .
lunch recess !
you can't free that bum?
if the bail's high enough ...
you judges are a drag !
we bust our asses to find the guilty ones ...
they'll get him off .
where are you?
to be or not to be ...
that's not really a question .
does that woman really matter to you?
something really strange ... almost taboo ...
a force propels me towards her ...
like the tide rushing in ...
it also goes out .
i'll help you .
will you let me?
he will .
you can stay with us a few days .
tell him , dad .
i got you a job with the railroad .
ok , back to work !
will you let me?
i think it'll work ...
i forgot ... someone gave this for you .
you forgot your gun .
you need us .
screw you !

some brioches for my friend .
kids today are scum !
they haven't invented cigarettes or blue jeans .

we must talk business .

you have to look .
i look forward to making another movie in a casino .

3 years ago on the riviera ...

we lost it .
i was expelled from the movie business ... ... a cinematographer .

i came to see someone .
that woman !
if i go to the moon , to get financing , will you write to me?
yes .
you took a long time to count to 33 !
maybe .
i won't work under these conditions .
i'll go say good bye .
the perfect blending of several voices hinders their ... ... individual progress .
i'm writing that down .
you and your lousy ideas ...

when everything's been lost but a daybreak ... ... and yet we're still breathing?
it's called sunrise , miss .
