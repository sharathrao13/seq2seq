i wanted us to write our own vows for the wedding , and now i can't do mine .
i ...
how do you explain love?
uh , i i guess i wouldn't know .
i don't think i've ever felt that way about a guy .
oh , someday you will .
maybe .
but in the meantime , i don't think it would hurt to get a little rowdy this weekend .
<i>jim's got single friends , </ i> <i>right? </ i>

hey , stifler .
why don't you come in and make yourself comfortable?
your letter made a great impression on coach marshall when he read it .
let me just refresh your memory , partner .
dear steve ,
i will be forever in your debt if you teach me to dance like you did in the gay bar .
i put serious thought into that letter .
don't push me 'cause i'm close to the edge .
i'm trying not to lose my head . " uh huh .
<i>uh</ i> <i>huh . </ i>
<i>[ laughs ] </ i>
<i>[ cadence ] </ i>

<i>at least something</ i> <i>you can actually wear again . </ i>
<i>wear again . </ i>

<i>but you don't think</ i> <i>it's too sexy , do you? </ i>
i mean , i don't want to seem slutty or anything .
i'm trying to attract a decent guy here .
<i>[ michelle scoffs ] </ i>
<i>it's a wedding . </ i>
<i>they'll all be decent guys . </ i>
i just don't feel quite like a virgin in it .
oh !
so , you guys have to be psyched to be done with college .
i mean , i swear , i'm running out of room in my brain for everything .
there's always room for plato and aristotle .
some of my favorites .
excuse me , guys .
finch , she thinks you were being sarcastic .
<i>[ stifler ] </ i>
<i>okay .
it's so good to see you . </ i>
<i>you want some help? </ i>
<i>here .

thank you .
oh , here they are .
hi , boys .
don't stand up .
the dads aren't here yet?
i'll go find him .
now , which one of you is the best man?
jim didn't pick just one .
or i mean , he he couldn't decide .
hey , paul .
hey , kevin .
<i>mom , i want you to meet steven . </ i>
he's friends ofjim's and mine and , oh , everyone's .
you look very familiar , steven .
really?
oh , i'm afraid we've never met .
oh .
oh .
well , we have now .
oh , looks like you found samantha's sweets .
oh , yes .
isn't their chocolate just to die for?
oh , well , you have no idea .
<i>actually , i do . </ i>
i love chocolate more than life itself .
more than life itself .
<i>yes . </ i> !
<i>i was just saying</ i> <i>to your friends that ... </ i>
i have something very precious here .
what is it?
michelle's grandmother's ... my mother's ... wedding ring .
isn't that precious?
but since all of you are the best man ,
i don't know who should ho hold onto it .
i think it's best if i ...
oh , um ...
i think you should get to know us first and then decide .
you are such a gentleman , steve .
i hear that all the time , but it never gets old .
aw .
hey , paul , uh , do you have a camera?
how thoughtful .
i must have forgotten my camera at home , steven .
oh , m maybe you could take , like , a mental note .
i won't forget this moment .
i bet you won't .
would you care to join us?
i would love to .
thank you .
well , come on .
lovely to see you fellas .

okay , i know ...
i know what you're doing .
look .
have you seen yourself?
i can't believe you're doing this .
just calm down , dude .
it's all set .
what's set?
i'm gonna teach you to dance like a " baryshiniankov .
oh , yeah .
he is pretty good .
<i>jim , he's not doing it to be nice . </ i>
<i>he's doing it to bone cadence . </ i>
look , maybe we should give him a chance .
you know , i think ...
i think ... that underneath all the fucks and shits and blow mes , there's a very sensitive person who is just thirsty for acceptance .
that's that's what i think .
oh , jim , you've gotta stop masturbating .
it's melting your brain .
observe the fuckin 'stif meister .
what is his defining characteristic?
he uses the f word excessively .
thanks , man .
but i also have confidence .
you're one big floppy cock .
look at you .
you've gotta stand like a man .
your posture tells your partner where to go .
okay .
okay .
okay?
follow my lead .
this is the waltz .
waltz .
okay .
waltz .
okay .
that's pretty good .
you're fuckin 'right it's good .
i'm gonna save your ass in this wedding .
pretty soon you're gonna want me to shave your balls .
should i shave my balls?
do you shave your balls?

<i>you know , there's nothing like</ i> <i>a local pub . </ i>
mm hmm .
it's like real america ... without all that corporateness and catchy jingles .
well , what's wrong with a good jingle?
i think it was voltaire who said ,
ajingle witty proves everything for my friends and i.
cadence .
i didn't know you were gonna be here .
you're just in time for voltaire's greatest hits .
voltaire?
stifler , please , who was voltaire?
someone much wiser than you , i'm afraid , finch .
actually , i'm getting a little burned out on all the intellectual stuff .
<i>yeah .
me too . </ i>
being smart is so hard .
i'll give you some intelligence .
voltaire can suck on my balls .
what?
it's about time somebody finally came out and said it .
hey , i'm gonna give you a quote to live by .
love life , get paid and then get laid .
that is the basic philosophy of the finch meister .
i like that .
bet you do .
but i don't know why you do ... because finch meister doesn't make any friggin 'sense .
sure , it does .
no fuckin 'shit it does .
cadence , let's leave the " crayton " here , shall we?
whatever .
fuck it .
i'm walkin 'anyway .
wait .
you know , actually , i think i'm gonna go stretch my legs with the finch meister .
you don't mind , do you , steven?
no .
ha !
it's on like donkey kong , bi i itch .
pack it up , bitch .
i'm on it .
thank you .
so , uh , cadence say anything about me?
whatever you and finch are pulling , she seems to like you both .
finch .
is she gonna be around tomorrow night?
no , she's going up to chicago with michelle for the final dress fitting .
what about her parents?
i think her mom kind of likes me .
they're going up north with , uh ... with my parents ... for , uh ... you know , to get things , uh , ready for the rehearsal .
so , uh ...
so that's where they'll be .
so don't bother looking for them or anything , you know .
a wedding .
shit .
how do you know she's the right girl?
i just do .
i'm a better person when i'm with michelle .
nobody else can ...
<i>no , no , no , shithead . </ i>
you hooked up with one other girl for , what , 10 seconds .
not to mention you passed on nadia .
dumbest fuckin 'thing ever .
you're like a blind man picking out his favorite porno .
this shit is crazy .

you know , michelle is the only , uh , girl that i've ...
i've been with .
honestly , now ...
honestly , would you have passed up sex with nadia?
why?
did she say something?
hypothetically , dad .
oh , hypothetically .
well , i mean , you know , jim , i'm a married man .
i'm ...
if lf lf you weren't married .
she's a college girl .
if you were a college guy .
in a heartbeat .
oh , yeah .
mm hmm .
first of all , what what you're feeling is so normal and perfectly natural .
marriage is not about , uh , animal lusting and and kinky sex games .
it's not so much about who's the dog and who's the fire hydrant tonight .
it's it's deeper than that .
the longer a marriage lasts , uh , the longer you can go , uh , without sex .
but when that magic night does happen , uh , it's it's all the more meaningful .
and let me tell you , your mother , bless her , can still make me , uh , squeal like a pig .
uh , and i mean that in the good sense , son .
do you follow what i'm saying?
you understand where i'm going?
i do .
i , uh ...
i think i , uh ...
anything else you need?
no .

this sucks .
did i say that out loud?

now , i thought about what you said , kev .
about , uh , about how my problems always seem to work out .

for the first time in my life ...

i i guess i just wanted to say thank you .

and it's natural .
it's perfectly natural .
but it's impossible to describe a feeling .
okay , first , nothing is impossible .
so , let's not focus on that .
why do you think , michelle , they call it " making love "?
i don't know .
i just call it " boning .
boning .
well , when you're doing other things with jim ... when you're not , um , boning ... how does he make you feel?
horny , like i wanna bone .
but we can't be boning from sunrise to sunset , dear .
oh , you've never tried it?
i certainly have .
i have .
i've boned .
from sunrise right through brunch , on more than one occasion .
but boning aside , um , i think they call it " making love " ... because you have to make love work .
you know , it's about compromise and sacrifice .
and i thinkjim has sacrificed for you .
my god , he shaved his entire pubic region , which would baffle most cultures around the world .
but he did it , and he did it for you .
you're right .
love isn't just a feeling .
it's shaving your balls .
thanks , dad .
i wouldn't get into too much detail on that .
excuse me .
pardon me .
