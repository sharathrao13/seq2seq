today is a good day to die .
what's happening?
it's crack .
get some help .
crackheads take up all our time .
what have we got?
hemmorage .
vaginal bleeding .
probably a street abortion .
we've got to open her up .
all the o. r. 's are full .
we can't wait .
i'll operate .
you can't !
just do it !
get him out of here .
15 years on the job and you're gonna get me canned in one day .
here we go .
forceps !
where is it?
clamp !
you got her .
all right , i've got her .
dave , get out of here .
now !
iabraccio !
what the hell are you doing?
randall steckle , " diary of a surgeon . " no .
randall steckle , " diary of a surgeon to be .
randall steckle , " making of a ...
forging of a surgeon . " no , pretentious .
randall steckle , " genesis "?
genesis of a young surgeon . " brilliant !
morning .
nice work .
keep it up .
suddenly , even though i was in a coma , i saw myself .
suddenly , even though i was in a coma , i saw myself .
iike , from above , looking down .
ralph , my husband , was crying .
the doctor was saying i was dying .
i saw myself in the bed and everything .
i started to float out into the hall .
then into this tunnel toward this light .
it was the most beautiful light i ever saw .
i heard this voice .
it was the most beautiful voice i ever heard .
i'm going to take your baby .
but you are going back .
and i woke up , and there was ralph and the doctor .
i was legally dead for 41/ 2 minutes .
but i didn't see no tunnel and i didn't see no light .
i did ... and it was so beautiful !
i was in this garden ...
this tunnel and this light ...
then this guide ... and a chariot and music .
terry , i think they'd better get you off medication .
thanks .
what's up?
good morning .
there's trouble in e. r.
you'd better watch your ass .
why are you always asking the patients about death?
i'll be late for class .
thanks , edna .
the spoils of arthritis .
some rather resilient inflammatory tissue here .
we're now under the transverse arch of the foot .
the metatarsals ...
brilliant , dr. steckle .
bring all that talent with you tonight .
nelson , about tonight .
i like you .
i have to decline on moral grounds .
there enough atrocity in the world without your own little horror .
it's ignorance we fear .
when did truth and knowledge become a horror?
especially to a scientist and a genius like yourself .
how are you doing , mannus?
fine .
i've been meaning to ask you , are you dating anyone?
identify .
costodiaphragmatic recess .
is it offensive if i make conversation?
sometimes it's nice to open up .
like old lenny here , he's open .
identify .
pylorus .
i've heard all the rumours and nicknames about you , rachel .
i'm sure you're a very warm woman .
not in the least bit repressed .
identify .
your brains .
you want to come over to my place?
dr. hurley , i need a word with dr. mannus .
i already said no to this .
steckle and hurley are in .
two of the top gpa's in the school .
i need you to handle the injections and the i. v.
i have no interest in watching you kill yourself .
i think you do .
good morning , class .
today's exam will be scaled .
three a's will be given , five b's and ten c's .
the remaining four will get d's and f's .
as in life , you're competing not with me , yourself or this exam ,
but with each other .
there are a lot of others who'd like to make a name for themselves .
it's a shame that the people with the ability don't have the nerve .
all right , we'll be there .
speak for yourself , joseph .
sure , it'll be dramatic , nelson .
you'll cry or faint , puke at best .
but then what?
i don't think you have the balls .
you just bring the equipment .
i'll bring my balls .
did you hear about labraccio?
dave , it's a four month suspension .
it won't affect your scholarship .
forget it , i'm out of here .
you're the best they've ever had .
they won't let you walk away .
besides , you were wrong .
no , damn it !
she was dying .
i saved her life .
what would you have done?
they have to make an example out of you to protect their insurance bond .
they'll take you back next term .
it doesn't matter .
i'd do the same thing again .
i know you would .
that's why i need you there tonight .
there are a few people i'd like to kill , but you're not one of them .
i don't want to die .
i want to come back with the answers to death ... and life .
i can get there with the others ... ... but i need you .
i need you to bring me back .
please .
i'm sorry , man , i can't do that .
just walk away , dave .
go climb a mountain .
i don't understand you any more .
you burn your career on a stranger .
now you turn your back on a friend .
iook , i'm real sorry about what happened today .
i won't make it back without you .
so don't do it .
dave ...
what if it works?
i don't want to be buried on saturday .
it costs $150 more to be buried on saturday .
mrs. amsler , you're doing much better .
ieave a message after the beep .
i know you're home .
don't be late .
bring the camera .
what camera?
thank god he called a specialist .
no lectures , okay?
you're engaged .
grow up .
i'm recording a few last adventures before resigning myself to monogamy .
i didn't realise .
i thought you were just a pussy marauder .
what the hell are we doing here?
this is goodbye med school .
ten bucks says he shits his drawers and we're out of here .
not those lights .
security will come running .
set up over the grate .
i just got the boiler going .
you're really going to do this?
just humour the man .
take me down with nitrous , sodium pentathol and a cold blanket .
i've got some chilled d5w .
when my temperature is 86 % , hit me with 200 joules .
the shock will stop my heart .
then take my mask off .
you said rachel was coming .
steckle , shut the door .
you handle the injections .
when the eeg flatlines , the brain is dead .
i'll be exploring .
give me 30 seconds .
set the blanket to warm and take me up to 93 % .
inject 1cc of adrenalin , and joe , come in with the defibs .
you bring me back to life .
with brain damage .
resembling in many ways ... a cabbage patch doll .
not with a body temperature of 86 % .
dr. mannus , will you handle the injections?
wait a minute .
quite simply , why are you doing this?
to see if there's anything beyond death .
philosophy failed .
religion failed .
now it's up to physical science .
mankind deserves to know .
you're doing this for mankind?
this letter absolves you of any responsibility .
this isn't for mankind .
you want to get on " 60 minutes "
sandwiched between andy rooney and the commercials .
tonight , a medical student who experienced death and came back .
fame is inevitable .
that's the wrong reason .
dr. hurley , electrodes .
don't you want to be on " 60 minutes "?
rachel , how about a little nitrous?
at least i'll go out with a laugh .
dr. hurley , get the blanket .
we're all professionals .
i'm sure this'll go very smoothly .
can i have your apartment?
it's a joke !
one minute .
don't be late .
start filming now .
you'll have a complete record of the experiment .
promise me you'll go through with this .
one little kiss goodbye .
i'll see you soon .
96 % .
this letter doesn't mean shit .
iet him sleep .
he'll have a wet dream and think he went to heaven .
now i know why i'm here .
i've stated my feelings , goodbye .
are you willing to risk your future for nelson's fame?
someone's coming !
is he dead?
he's only sleeping .
talk some sense into these people .
i'll do it .
i've got nothing to lose .
just his life !
i can get him back .
just stop his heart for a minute .
don't think i couldn't have .
no !
clear .
what are you doing?
a systole .
you're killing him .
no wonder you got tossed .
stop this shit .
i did not come to medical school to murder my classmates !
flatline .
they're getting smaller .
he's dying .
brain death .
now it's real .
start filming .
he's dead , isn't that enough?
let me try to bring him back .
just watch the door .
we're in the room with a dead man .
one minute to go .
start filming !
30 seconds to go .
okay , let's heat him up .
20 seconds .
89 % , 90 % ...
sodium bicarbonate ready .
i'm charging the paddles .
monitor the ekg .
body temp : 93 % .
here we go .
what have we got?
not a goddamn thing .
up me to 300 .
begin cpr .
sodium bicarbonate and eppy .
my god !
not a goddamn thing !
98 % .
hit him again .
350 .
nothing .
got him !
steckle , help me .
more eppy .
in .
we got rem .
nelson , can you hear us?
welcome back , man .
the crazy motherfucker did it !
jesus christ !
steckle , that's some bedside manner .
you'll make one hell of a doctor .
suck me .
can you recall any specific emotion?
heat , cold , anything like that?
you can't be specific .
did you see a tunnel of light?
no , but there is something out there .
it's comforting .
have you any idea how big this is?
he could use some air .
you guys could get us some fluids .
thanks for saving my life .
it was so much fun .
how do you feel , wise one?
like a highly tuned instrument .
can you hear the traffic on the lake shore?
underneath that there's a hum .
it's the street lights .
even fainter ...
i can hear a kind of dragging sound .
and it's getting louder .
no .
i not only hear it , i can feel it .
yeah , your prognosis is excellent .
you'll be great on " 60 minutes " .
it's bigger than that , david .
i'm sure you'll see to that .
you're not buying any of this .
you forgot ...
i'm an atheist .
are you all right for a few minutes?
how's he doing?
he thinks he's back from the dead .
how's he doing?
he thinks he's back from the dead .
that's what we did , right?
all we did was get lucky .
i would like to go next .
yeah , i'd like to be famous , too .
it's not about fame .
they'll build monuments to you .
small stone ones .
rest in peace . " i'm going next .
i'd be willing to go 1minute 20 seconds .
1 : 30 .
are you two so competitive that you're willing to bet your lives?
1 : 30 .
that's it then .
not a bad price to pay for fame and glory .
die to be a hero , but don't die to be a celebrity .
champ?
someone ought to stay with him .
i will .
are you okay?
i'd like to go home .
are you okay?
you were hyperventilating .
your blood pressure will rise
as your cardiovascular vessels constrict .
god , you're beautiful .
get some rest .
i bet 24 hours ago you didn't think you'd be spending the night here .
you were lucky last night , nelson .
don't push it .
engagem ent party
i want to wish you two the best of everything together .
hello , may i please speak to anne coldren?
anne?
hi , i've been thinking about you .
how are you?
counting the days to thanks giving break .
i've got to transfer to a school closer to you or get a faster car .
we should've married last summer .
my mother wasn't ready yet .
you know , you're the best .
if anything happens ...
joe , what's wrong?
i don't know .
i'm just tired .
i'm not making any sense .
i should go .
joe , you're scaring me .
it's okay , nothing's wrong .
i love you .
bye .
nothing .
starting cpr .
cpr and adrenalin , and nothing !
what's going on?
come on , joe !
come on , nelson , let me try .
we're running out of time !
let me try .
i'm doing everything i can !
nelson , step back .
come on , joe !
i got him .
oxygen .
0xygen ready .
cpr successful .
hurley lives .
it's okay , joe .
it was great .
here it comes .
define " great " .
i don't know , it's not thinking about the past or the future .
it's difficult to explain .
yeah , dying is funny that way .
nelson's right , there definitely is activity beyond death .
absolutely .
the experience was strange .
it was almost erotic .
he's dead and he gets laid .
what do you mean , erotic?
i don't want you to think it was wantonly sexual .
no , that never would have occurred to me .
it was friendly .
it was something vaguely feminine guiding me .
this could be the conquest of our generation .
the last great frontier .
first you had the sea , then america , the west , the moon ... ...
mr. leary , drugs , the inner journey ...
our former first lady and the outer journey ...
but this is ours !
we did have disco .
fuck the baby boomers .
watch your mouth .
i found something .
remember?
i came back from the dead tonight .
it doesn't surprise me .
we had elvis in here last night .
pay when you're ready , okay?
was it difficult getting back?
not that i remember .
but you remember everything else?
i think you guys are full of shit .
i'm not buying any of this .
i wouldn't buy it either ... ... unless i'd been there .
so what about it , dave?
an atheist has nothing to lose .
i'm going next .
nobody's going next .
you're looking for answers where there are none .
you just saw what you wanted to see .
give it up .
it's too dangerous .
we can't turn back now .
i'm going further .
1 : 50 .
two minutes ...
i changed my mind .
two minutes .
2 : 10 .
2 : 20 .
it looks like we found a winner .
enjoying yourself , nelson?
joe ...
was there anything negative about your experience?
no .
nothing .
good .
hold on .
was that your idea of chivalry?
were you trying to show me up?
not everything is about you .
nobody seems to want me to go under .
i don't need your protection .
what do you need , mannus?
what do you think i need?
when someone is as smart and driven as you are , and very beautiful ,
it makes the rest of us very nervous .
why did you change your mind?
i'm the sceptic on this .
if i see there's nothing out there , there's no reason for us to go on .
how do you explain the similarity in death experiences?
people from different cultures see the same things in the same order .
maybe there's a hormone released by the brain at the time of death .
no , you're reaching .
what if you go and there is something out there?
then you can kill yourself , too .
i'm not going to kill myself .
i'm glad to hear that , mannus .
i might miss you .
so why this obsession with death?
it's just an interest .
a personal interest .
goodnight .
can i drive you home?
no , thanks .
i didn't take the money .
i got the toaster , but too many appliances make you love me .
right , nelson?
in the end , we all know what we've done .
champ?
come here , champ .
come here , boy .
what are you doing here , kid?
are you all right?
are you okay?
are you lost?
halloween morning .
rotting pumpkins , burning leaves ,
black cats mating like rats in the alley .
it were as if we felt no fear .
as if we were already dead , and had nothing to lose by dying .
because we lived life so well , and loved life so much ,
we imagined ourselves immortal .
overwhelming the powers that be with our passion for science .
or maybe we were fucked in the head .
hey , i'm joe hurley .
you're terry , right?
you had a near death experience .
i don't want to talk about it .
wait a minute .
i had a near death experience also .
i need someone to talk to .
this thing changed my life .
at first , they didn't believe me .
what the hell do they know?
if you have to go to class , maybe we can discuss it one night this week?
all that day i knew something was going to happen .
i've always had premonitions .
once , my aunt was to fly ...
why did you do this to me , joe?
no !
trick or treat .
it's halloween .
there's a full moon .
aren't we pushing it a little bit?
i'm sorry i'm late .
i ran into some very big guys .
let me take a look at it .
i'm fine .
where the hell have you been?
i don't feel well .
look at you .
just worry about your camera .
nice outfit .
are you ready?
i'm ready .
who are you supposed to be?
boner man?
2 : 20 , don't forget .
you just hurry up and get back .
you can buy us breakfast .
don't let go of the rope .
hoka hey .
see you soon .
20 cc's sodium pentathol in .
86 % .
200 joules charged .
clear .
flatline .
what hangs in the air palpably?
ls it hope , or the fear of death?
shut up , steckle .
no , you shut up !
what if he didn't make it back?
would you miss him , rachel?
one minute .
90 % .
give him another five seconds .
why not ten?
we've got the time .
are you serious?
joey , i trusted you .
stations .
joe , move yourself .
come on , no kidding around here .
who's kidding?
what's going on here?
92 % .
joe , get it !
come on .
2 : 15 , 2 : 16 , 2 : 17 , 2 : 18 ... 2 : 20 .
hand it over .
this is my lab .
300 joules .
charged .
clear .
breathe !
1, 000 , 2, 000 ...
what comes next?
knock it off , nelson !
5, 000 .
breathe .
300 joules charged .
clear .
come on , dave .
that's it !
that's not it .
it's a v fib !
try lidocaine .
not yet .
come on , dave .
raise it to 360 .
clear .
try lidocaine .
three fucking minutes .
starting cpr .
joe , keep filming .
i'm going to bring him back .
you lied to me , joe .
we've got him .
1mg eppy in .
that was close .
that was way too close .
hoka hey .
what did you say?
hoka hey .
it's the war cry of the sioux lndians .
it means ...
today is a good day to die . " so was it , dave?
i don't know if i was dead .
i may have felt something .
a dream ... or just a bunch of stuff stored up inside my mind .
you were brain dead .
some electrical current circulating through my body ...
it would've shown up on the eeg .
you were dead .
so what happened?
it's hard to verbalise .
it's like being paranoid without the fear .
iike being watched .
you guys were standing over me .
who could be watching?
the dead .
the sceptic did feel something .
i'm going again .
no way !
i've been bumped twice .
four minutes .
labraccio went for 3 : 50 .
that was a mistake .
under four minutes is pointless .
nobody is going for four minutes !
4 : 25 .
5 minutes .
i'm next or i'm out for good .
it'll be hard without her .
but without me ...
or me .
well , mutiny at last .
i trusted you with a brilliant idea .
it was the chance of a lifetime .
give it a rest , nelson .
none of you had my foresight !
rachel , you want to go next?
be my guest , but this was my idea !
you're tourists !
i would've gone 3 : 30 or 3 : 40 .
i still might .
but 4 : 25 is crazy .
we're pushing the five minute mark .
it's dangerous .
you shit , joe .
you said you loved me , joe .
i love you , joe .
buddy?
skelator , are you listening to me?
thanks for staying .
i'm on the early shift .
you seem fine .
i'll see you later .
about tonight ...
don't try to talk me out of it .
why are you doing this?
i've lost people that are close to me .
i want to make sure they've gone to a good place .
is that so trivial?
to tell you the truth , it's the best reason i've heard yet for going .
there's something i didn't tell you about last night .
i had this feeling that if i had gone any further ... ... that there was something out there protecting me .
something good .
so you don't need to go under .
the atheist now believes in god?
i'm trying to tell you that i don't want you to do it .
think about all we'll have to talk about ... when you bring me back .
i'm dying .
don't lie to me .
i'm dying .
don't lie to me .
mrs. amsler , you've fought well .
sometimes we just have to let go .
that's what the voices say .
what voices?
they say , " have you done enough?
have you told everyone you love them?
i have .
they're friendly voices .
they're telling you what you need to know .
what?
that you have someplace to go .
do you believe that?
yes , i do .
yes , i do .
hey , fellatio !
got a match?
well , i do .
your face and my ass .
your breath and a buffalo fart .
do i know you?
you don't know jack shit !
butt wad , needle dick , cock bite ,
jack off , limp wrist ,
banana breath , shit bird , bird turd , turd face ,
kiss ass , brown nose , macho wimp , limp dick !
what's the matter?
gonna cry?
cry baby davie .
shit faced , rat turd , ass licking , son of a bitch .
how did it happen?
i was playing hockey .
about last night ...
it's okay .
no show labraccio .
that's not like him .
it's his way of trying to stop me .
it's not a good idea to continue .
we don't need david .
can you do this?
can you trust me?
no , but let's do it anyway .
nitrous on .
see you soon .
how long's she been under?
we're bringing her back .
she hasn't been under long enough .
just do it , joe .
don't expect any kisses for this .
aborting fourth experiment .
why?
why don't you ask dr. death?
what's going on?
we're bringing rachel back early .
drop it .
think about rachel .
joe's right .
91 % .
let's be ready .
rachel , don't go in there .
i told you not to do that .
denny !
it's your fault !
nothing .
take me up to 300 .
come on , rachel .
300 joules .
clear !
got her ! .
v fib .
we don't have her .
it's okay , we'll get her .
step me up to 360 .
what did you do to me?
a short , maybe a circuit .
joe , you charged the battery?
shit !
starting cpr .
bag her , steckle .
no pulse .
it's not working .
joe , take over .
she's been under 4 minutes .
we're moving to bretylium .
it's the only way .
don't do it , you'll fry her .
nelson !
please , don't !
you'll bring her back?
come on , mannus .
iidocaine in .
come on back to us .
come on .
wait !
i heard something .
oxygen !
she's back .
why did you stop us?
something happened to me today .
there was a girl ...
winnie hicks .
i went to school with her .
we used to make fun of her .
on the train , she started calling me names .
right in front of me !
she was still only ten years old .
maybe you fell asleep .
no , it was not a dream .
i've seen some odd things , too .
i thought it was brain damage .
in your case it probably is .
shut that off , steckle , this is personal .
i've been haunted by images of women that i secretly videotaped .
they're all members of the joe hurley video library .
what about you , nelson?
who's come looking for you?
his name's billy mahoney .
he's a kid we picked on in school .
it's no big deal .
then what happened to your face?
the little guy gets carried away .
wait a minute .
i can understand dave nodding off , and pervert here having flashbacks .
you're saying this guy physically touches you .
that is not possible !
this is too weird .
weird?
we've experienced death .
now somehow we've brought our sins back physically .
when did you know about this?
after joe went .
but you didn't say a word !
jesus christ !
we're scientists .
it's reckless , immoral and unethical for you to withhold your findings .
rachel mannus may have the answers to life and death .
she was under for five minutes !
if she walks out of that ladies 'room with those answers ,
the whole world will worship her .
just like you do .
you should've told us , nelson .
you wouldn't have done it .
at least we'd have had a choice !
we're fucked .
rachel , are you all right?
i'm okay .
i said i was fine .
are you guys gonna watch me?
come on , billy mahoney .
give it your best shot .
i dare you ...
i fucking dare you .
things from our past want revenge?
i'm not exactly sure how it works .
but if you see anything , i want you to talk to me about it .
you can tell the doctor .
i'll be in the living room .
is it people we've hurt?
did something happen tonight?
no .
just try and get some rest .
how's she doing?
i think she's hiding something .
what did nelson do to that kid?
i don't know !
we must keep each other informed .
yeah , i'm sorry .
why don't you guys take off?
i'll stay with her .
i'm sorry .
we're gonna get you , billy mahoney !
no !
stop , nelson !
how are you doing?
i'm late .
i'll see you later .
wait .
where are you going?
i've got to stop her .
good morning , rachel .
no ... no ...
her voices were wrong .
there's nothing beautiful out there .
losing them is part of our work .
but i was wrong .
you look like you're enjoying the day .
don't you remember me , joe?
yes , of course .
are you a model?
you could be .
look , i've got to go .
i'm not picking you up .
i just picked you out .
mind if i buy you a drink?
i'll call you this weekend .
fine , i'm in the book .
hey , gorgeous .
who are you?
what are you doing?
some crazy girl ...
do i know you?
would you like to?
we don't have to do anything .
we can just lie together .
hold each other in our underwear .
i'll call you .
i promise .
i'm tired of playing the field .
we can stop whenever you want .
it'll only make our relationship better .
i've never felt like this before .
of course i respect you .
call me whenever you want .
show me that you love me .
you're not real !
anne , is that you?
is it really you?
you sounded so upset on the phone .
i was worried .
i took the bus .
what a great surprise .
how long have you been here?
long enough to see your tapes .
my god !
you're gonna think i'm leaving you because you slept with those girls .
they meant nothing to me .
i wish they had meant something .
if you had cared for any of them ,
i could have fought that .
but to film all those girls ...
to have so little respect ...
those women trusted you .
you have no understanding of trust .
it's not what you think .
yes , it is .
hello , is this mrs. earl r. hicks?
hello , is this mrs. earl r. hicks?
do you have a daughter winnie , about 26 years old?
you do?
i'm david labraccio .
i was in school with winnie .
yeah , my parents still live there .
i wanted to get in touch with her and i was wondering ...
okay .
do you have her address?
great .
i really appreciate it .
bye .
jesus !
it looks as bad as it feels?
you want me to take a look at it?
no .
how's rachel doing?
she didn't come out of that bathroom with the answers to life and death .
where are you going?
can i go?
it's a two hour drive .
i don't want to be alone .
you will remove the left kidney and dissect the lower intestines .
remove the ascending colon from the transverse colon .
proceed to the sigmoid colon and on to the appendix .
where the hell are you going?
are you okay?
i would be fine if everyone would stop asking me if i'm all right .
is she getting the heebie jeebies?
i'm spooking , too .
getting us kicked out of med school won't get anne back .
mannus !
i'll handle this .
back to work or suffer the consequences .
fuck it .
this must be it .
winnie did well for herself .
she won't even remember you .
it's worth a shot .
are you coming?
no .
iisten , if anything happens ....
if you need me , just honk the horn .
ring , ring , ring .
dave , you should've sent a letter .
anybody home?
hi , is your mother at home?
coming .
go in the house , baby .
yes?
can i help you?
yeah , i think you can .
are you winnie hicks?
from claremont?
i'm david labraccio .
we went to school together .
i was a little smaller then .
i just drove up from the city .
that's my truck .
hello , i'm nice .
he's nice .
we're both fucking lunatics .
can i come in , please?
i've got to hand it to you , dave ... you've got guts .
this is beautiful .
you've done well for yourself .
well , it isn't medical school .
but i never liked school anyway .
i wasn't very good at it .
i'm surprised you remember me .
i do remember you .
i also remember the way we treated you back then .
you were a little shy , and i was a real jerk ... and i'm sorry .
what are you talking about?
that was so long ago i don't even remember .
iet's not dredge up all that stuff .
however we made you feel ... it was wrong .
we were wrong .
go on .
i have a family now .
i haven't been that ugly little girl in quite some time .
you were never ugly .
why did you come here?
david , help !
i know how kids are .
it didn't mean anything .
i didn't mean to come here ...
winnie , are you all right?
i'm fine , ben .
i'm sorry if i made you feel bad .
i didn't want to hurt you again .
i'm gonna go .
david?
thank you .
are you sure?
thanks .
david , help !
nelson , stop .
stop !
where's billy mahoney?
no one's here but the two of us .
iet go !
where the hell have you guys been?
she freaked in class .
how are you doing?
fine , for somebody who keeps seeing her father who's been dead 20 years .
death is beautiful . " what a bunch of crap .
how are you doing , nelson?
okay?
i'd like to thank you for the nightmare .
you were so eager to jump on ...
welcome aboard .
you withheld information .
i'm sorry you're so upset .
you're not the only one at risk !
i always felt this was unnatural .
steckle , you didn't risk a thing .
stop !
we're all in this together .
no , we're not .
isn't she strong?
so independent .
when i get into trouble , i don't drag everybody down with me .
come on !
what happened to you?
caught with your videotapes down .
you swore at a little girl .
you're having bad dreams about your daddy .
i'm really sorry !
you don't know anything about me .
but dave does , doesn't he?
come on , they're your sins .
live with them ...
i do .
you want to see death?
take a good look .
it is beautiful .
you've already hurt yourself .
do you want to hurt her , too?
help him find billy mahoney .
just do it , all right?
don't leave him alone .
why do we want to find billy?
young dr. dave thinks he's solved our karmic problems .
atonement , gentlemen .
atonement?
wait a goddamn minute !
you're always running away from me .
why don't you talk to me?
my father shot himself .
and you feel responsible?
there was this door in our hallway and i wasn't supposed to go in ...
kids always feel responsible .
you could not have been to blame .
you said it yourself .
people we've wronged want revenge .
i don't know if this will help , but going to see winnie hicks ...
i can't explain , but it lifted ... just asking for forgiveness ...
winnie hicks is alive .
my father's dead .
your father is in a good place .
he wants you to let him go .
then why is he back?
here .
where the hell are we?
we'd better get you to a hospital .
come on , this is a short cut .
i can't believe i remember all this .
the neighbourhood's falling apart .
give me the keys !
step on a crack break your mother's back ...
iast one over is a rotten egg !
come on , boys , salvation just ahead .
this is a graveyard .
nelson , where the fuck are you?
this isn't funny any more .
it never was .
where the hell are you?
right here .
this is where billy lives .
wake up , you little shit , you've got company !
i knew he was here ... because i put him here .
billy mahoney !
no , nelson , don't do it !
i was taken away from my family when i was nine years old .
i went to stoneham school for boys .
i thought i'd paid my dues !
it was an accident .
let's go home , okay?
dave's right ...
i can still make amends .
how?
nelson?
joe , i've got to borrow your car .
nelson , wait .
my god !
hello .
what?
where?
nelson freaked out .
joe and steckle are stranded .
will you be all right alone?
yeah .
daddy .
rachel .
sweetheart ...
i'm sorry .
forgive me .
billy mahoney died 17 years ago , and nelson feels responsible .
do you know where he went?
he ran off to make amends .
you think he'd try to flatline?
alone?
that would be suicide .
david?
no , it's nelson .
david's out trying to find you .
i wanted to say i was sorry .
please , tell david .
i'm sorry i got you into this .
no , none of that matters now .
rachel , everything matters .
everything we do matters .
that's why i'm going under again .
no , nelson , wait .
tell me where you are .
i really am sorry .
it's payback for our arrogance .
save it .
it's a good thing i didn't flatline .
i used to tease my fat babysitter .
