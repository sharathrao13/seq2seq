# you know how we do it , ain't nothing to it
# but the floss of the crowd , harris & ross
# 'cause if you fuck with ours , we leave scars
# on a " g " right course , living like stars
# might hit the highway on the vegas run
# fool , 'cause it's friday
# oh , yeah , throw your neighbourhood in the air
# if you don't care
# oh , yeah , throw your neighbourhood in the air
# if you don't care
# standing outside on the friday
# living on the edge
# 'cause we all got them hard heads
# it seems like we all away
# for the drive by , playing tag with satan
# but we chillin ', yeah , we ready and willin '
# you hear about the latest west side killing?
# but we slippin ', say trippin '
# for dipping , pistol gripping , never slipping
# big g's trying to hang out

# my big homie just got out
# used to be damned , now we just crack dead
# he's about as hard as darth vader
# in his sweatshirt , khakis , and chuck taylors

# with half a chicken and a cock
# and i love her
# 'cause she dared to fuck around
# with the underground
# pussy hound , and her ass is big , round , and wide
# jacked up , making niggers down the rye
# smoking in dope , playing that super nintendo
# hear a rat a tat on my window
# there goes that pelvic thrust
# don't trust a rubber , 'cause it's bound to bust
# in the oven , in the nappy
# i had on 2 , so i was happy
# 'cause that hlv will make your dick hang sideways
# and that ain't cool , fool , 'cause it's friday
# throw your neighbourhood in the air , if you don't care
# oh , yeah , throw your neighbourhood in the air
