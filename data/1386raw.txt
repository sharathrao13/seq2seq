all you can do is ... pray for a quick death ... which ... you ain't gonna get .
oh , god .
you ever listen to k bllly's " super sounds of the '70s "?
it's my personal favorite .
joe egan and gerry rafferty were a duo known as stealer's wheel ... when they recorded this dylanesque , pop , bubble gum favorite ... from april of 1974 .
that reached up to number five ... as k bllly's " super sounds of the '70s " continues .

i'm fuckin 'dyin '!
they're not to make a move 'til joe cabot shows up .
i was sent in to get him .
all right?
you heard 'em .
they said he's on his way .
don't pussy out on me now , marvin .
we're just gonna sit here and bleed ...
'til joe cabot sticks his fuckin 'head through that door .
say hello to a motherfucker who's inside .
cabot's doing a job .
he wants me on the team .
this better not be a joke .
this ain't a joke .
i'm in .
i'm up his ass .
nice guy eddie tells me joe wants to meet me .
he says i should just wait for a phone call .
after waiting three days he calls me last night and says joe's ready .
he'll pick me up in 15 minutes .
who picked you up?
nice guy .
we get to a bar .
what bar?
smokey pete's in gardena .
we get there ... and i meet joe and a guy named mr. white .
phony name .
my name's mr. orange .
mr. orange?
mr. orange .
okay , mr. orange .
you ever see this motherfucker before?
who?
mr. white?
yes .
mr. white .
no .
he ain't one of cabot's men either .
he's gotta be from out of town .
joe knows him good .
how can you tell?
the way they talk .
you can tell they're buddies .
you two talk?
me and joe?
mr. white .
a little .
about what?
the brewers .
milwaukee brewers?
they won the night before .
he made some money off them .
good .
if this crook's a brewers fan , he's gotta be from wisconsin .
and i'll bet you everything ... they got a sheet in milwaukee on this mr. white's ass .
so i want you to go through everybody in milwaukee ... with a history of armed robbery and put a name to the face .
nice work , freddy .
thank you , my man .
how was long beach mike's referral?
perfect .
his backing me up went a long way .
i told them i played poker with him .
nice guy checked it out and said it was a okay .
said i was a good thief , i didn't rattle ... and that i was ready to move .
he's a good guy .
i wouldn't be inside without him .
long beach mike is not your friend .
long beach mike is a fucking scumbag .
he's selling out his friends .
that's how nice he fuckin 'is .
i'll take care of his ass ... but you get that scumbag out of mind and take care of business .
gone .
use the commode story?
what's the commode story?
it's a scene .
memorize it .
a what?
undercover cops gotta be brando .
to do this job you gotta be a great actor , naturalistic .
you gotta be naturalistic as hell .
if you're a bad actor , that's bullshit in this job .
what is this?
that's an amusing anecdote about a drug deal .
something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job .
i gotta memorize all this?
there's four pages of this shit .
think about it like it's a joke .
memorize what's important .
the rest you make your own .
you can tell a joke , can't you?
well , pretend you're don rickles ... and tell a joke , all right?
the things you gotta remember are the details .
the details sell your story .
this particular story takes place in a men's room .
you gotta know all the details whether they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands .
you gotta know if the stalls ain't got no doors or not .
you gotta know if they got liquid soap or that pink , granulated shit ... they used in high school .
you gotta know if they got hot water or not , if it stinks ... if some nasty , lowlife , scum ridden motherfucker ... sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls .
you gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode .
what you gotta do is take all them details and make 'em your own .
while you're doing that , remember that this story is about you ... and how you perceived the events that went down .
the only way to do that ... is keep sayin 'it ... and sayin 'it and sayin 'it .
this is during the l. a. marijuana drought , 1986 .
i still had a connection , which was insane 'cause ... you couldn't get any weed anywhere then .
anyway , i had a connection with this hippie chick in santa cruz ... and all my friends knew it .
they call me and say , " hey , freddy
i say , " hey , dude .
you gettin 'some?
can you get some for me too?
they knew i still smoked , so they asked me to buy some for them .
it got to be
every time i bought some weed i was buyin 'for four or five people .
finally i said , fuck this shit .
i'm makin 'this bitch rich .
she didn't even have to meet these people .
i was doing all the work .
that got to be a pain in the ass , people calling all the time .
i couldn't even rent a tape without six fuckin 'interruptions .
when's the next time you're gettin 'some?
motherfucker , i'm tryin 'to watch the lost boys .
when i get some , i'll call you .
then these rink a dink potheads come by .
they're my friends and everything , but still
i got it laid out in 60 dollar bags , they don't want 60 dollars worth .
they want ten dollars 'worth , and breaking it up wasn't easy .
i don't even know what ten dollars 'worth looks like .
this was a very weird situation .
remember back in '86 ... there was a major fuckin 'drought .
nobody had anything .
people were livin 'on resin , smokin 'the wood in their pipes .
this chick had a bunch and she's beggin 'me to sell it .
so i told her i wasn't gonna be joe the pot man anymore ... but i would take a little bit and sell it to my close friends .
she agreed and we kept the same arrangement as before ten percent and free pot for me ... if i helped her that weekend .
she was sellin 'a brick of weed and didn't wanna go to the buy alone .
her brother usually goes with her , but he's in county unexpectedly .
what for?
his traffic tickets gone to warrant .
they stopped him , found warrants on him , took him to county .
she doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed .
i don't wanna do this .
i have a very bad feeling about it .
she keeps asking me , asking me .
finally i said okay 'cause i'm sick of hearing it .
so we go to the train station  wait .
you're goin 'to the train station with the weed on ya?
the guy needed it right away .
anyway , we get to the train station ... and we're waitin 'for the guy .
i'm carryin 'the weed in a carry on bag .
i gotta take a piss , so i tell her i'm goin 'to the boy's room .
so i walk into the men's room and who's standing there?
four los angeles county sheriffs and a german shepherd .
they're waitin 'for you?
no , they're just talkin '.
when i walked in , they all stopped talkin '... and they looked at me .
that's hard .
that's a fuckin 'hard situation .
german shepherd starts barking .
he's barkin 'at me .
i mean , it's obvious he's barkin 'at me .
take off , man .
just bail .
get the fuck outta there .
panic hits me like a bucket of water .
bam !
right in the face .
i'm drenched in panic and these cops are lookin 'at me and they know it .
they can smell it , sure as that fuckin 'dog can .
they can smell it on me .
shut up .
so anyway , i got my gun drawn .
i point it at this guy and i tell him ...
freeze .
don't fuckin 'move .
this little idiot's looking right at me and saying ...
i know , i know .
but meanwhile his right hand is creepin 'toward the glove box .
i scream at him , " asshole !
i'm gonna blow you away right now !
put your hands on the dash .
he's still looking at me , nodding his head .
i know , buddy , i know .
meanwhile his hand is still going for the glove box .
and i said ...
buddy , i'm gonna shoot you in the face ... if you don't put your hands up .
chuck , what are you doin '?
listen to the officer !
put your hands on the dash !
so then the guy snaps out of it and puts his hands on the dash .
what was he goin 'for?
his fucking registration .
you're kidding .
no , man !
stupid citizen doesn't know how close he came to gettin 'blown away .
that close , man .
you knew how to handle that situation .
you shit your pants , dive in and swim .
tell me more about cabot .
i don't know .
he's a cool guy .
he's funny .
he's a funny guy .
you remember the fantastic four?
yeah , with that invisible bitch ... and " flame on " and shit , right?
thing .
motherfucker ...
iooks just like the thing .
hey !
showtime !
grab your jacket .
i'm parked outside .
i'll be right down .
he'll be right down .
don't pussy out on me now .
they don't know .
they don't know shit .
you're not gonna get hurt .
you're fuckin 'baretta .
they believe every fuckin 'word 'cause you're super cool .
there goes our boy .
the guy has to have rocks in his head the size of gibraltar ... to work undercover .
you want one of these?
yeah , give me the bear claw .
i know what i'm talking about .
black women ain't the same as white women .
there's a slight difference .
very funny .
you know what i mean .
what a white bitch will put up with , a black bitch wouldn't for a minute .
if you cross their line , they fuck you up .
i gotta go along with pink on that .
okay , mr. expert , if this is such a truism ... why is it that every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
i'll bet those same niggers who show their ass in public ... when their bitches get 'em home they chill the fuck out .
not these guys .
oh , yeah .
those guys too .
tell you guys a story .
in one of daddy's clubs there's a black cocktail waitress named elois .
elois?
yeah , elois .
e and lois .
we called her lady e.
where was she from?
compton?
she's from ladora heights .
ladora heights .
the black beverly hills .
it's not the black beverly hills .
it's the black palos verdes .
anyway ...
lady e , she was a man eater upper .
un fuckin 'believable .
every guy who ever saw her had to jack off to her at least once .
you know who she looked like?
christie love .
remember that tv show get christie love ... about the black female cop?
she always used to say , " you're under arrest , sugar !
who played christie love?
pam grier .
no , it wasn't pam grier .
pam grier was the other one .
pam grier did the film .
christie love was like a pam grier tv show without pam grier .
so , who was christie love?
how should i know?
great .
now i'm totally fuckin 'tortured .
whoever it was , she looked exactly like elois .
anne francis .
no .
that was honey west .
anne francis is white .
i'm tryin 'to tell a story here .
she looked exactly like elois .
we come into the club one night ... and there's carlos , the bartender .
he's a wetback .
he's a friend of mine .
i says to him , " carlos , where's lady e tonight?
apparently lady e ... was married to real piece of dog shit , a real animal .
he used to do things to her .
like what?
what would he do?
beat her up?
i don't know .
he just did things .
so anyway , one night she plays it real cool .
she waits for him to get drunk .
he falls asleep on the fuckin 'couch .
she sneaks up on him , puts some glue on his dick ... and glues his dick to his belly .
jesus christ !
i'm serious , man .
i'm dead serious .
they had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose .
was he all pissed off?
how would you feel if you had to do a fuckin 'handstand to take a piss?
you guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around , huh?
giggling like a bunch of girls in the schoolyard .
well , let me tell a joke .
five guys sittin 'in a bullpen ...
san quentin ... wonderin 'how the fuck they got there .
what did we do wrong?
what shouldn't we have done?
it's your fault , his fault
all that bullshit .
finally somebody says ...
wait a minute .
while we were planning this caper ... we just sat around tellin 'fuckin 'jokes .
got the message?
i don't mean to holler at ya .
when this caper's over , and i'm sure it'll be successful ... we'll go down to hawaiian lslands , i'll laugh with all of youse .
find me a different character down there .
right now it's a matter of business .
with the exception of eddie and myself ... who you already know ... we're gonna be using aliases on this job .
under no circumstances ... do we want any one of you to relate to each other ... by your christian names .
and i don't want any talk about yourself personally .
that includes where you been , your wife's name ... where you might've done time ... or a bank maybe you robbed in st. petersburg .
all i want you guys to talk about , if you have to ... is what you're gonna do .
that should do it .
these are your names
mr. brown , mr. white ...
mr. blonde , mr. blue ...
mr. orange and mr. pink .
why am i mr. pink?
because you're a faggot !
all right?
why can't we pick our own colors?
no way .
no way .
tried it once .
it doesn't work .
you get four guys all fightin 'over who gets to be mr. black .
they don't know each other , so nobody wants to back down .
no way .
i pick .
you're mr. pink .
be thankful you're not mr. yellow .
but mr. brown , that's too close to mr. shit .
mr. pink sounds like mr. pussy .
how about mr. purple?
that's sounds good .
i'll be mr. purple .
you're not mr. purple .
some guy on some other job is mr. purple .
you're mr. pink !
who cares what your name is?
easy for you to say .
you're mr. white .
you have a cool sounding name .
if it's no big deal to be mr. pink , you wanna trade?
nobody's tradin 'with anybody .
this ain't a goddamn fuckin 'city council meeting , you know .
now listen up , mr. pink .
there's two ways you can go on this job my way or the highway .
what's it gonna be , mr. pink?
jesus christ , joe .
fuckin 'forget about it .
it's beneath me .
i'm mr. pink .
let's move on .
i'll move on when i feel like it .
do all you guys got the goddamn message?
i'm so goddamn mad hollerin 'at you guys , i can hardly talk .
let's go to work .
let's go over it .
where are you?
i stand outside and guard the door .
i don't let anybody go in or out .
mr. brown .
he waits in the car .
i give him the signal , he pulls up in front .
mr. blonde and mr. blue .
crowd control .
they handle the customers and the employees .
that girl's ass .
sittin 'right here on my dick .
myself and mr. pink?
you two take the manager and make him give you the diamonds .
we're there for those stones , period .
since no display cases are being fucked with , no alarms should go off .
we're out in two minutes , not one second longer .
what if the manager won't give you the diamonds?
a store like this is insured up the ass .
they're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever .
if you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's charles bronson ... smash their nose with your gun .
drops him right to the floor .
everyone jumps .
he falls down screaming , blood squirts out of his nose .
freaks everybody out .
nobody says fuckin 'shit after that .
some bitch might talk shit to you .
give her a look like she's next .
watch her shut the fuck up .
if it's the manager , that's different .
the managers know not to fuck around ... so if he's giving you static ... he probably thinks he's a real cowboy so you gotta that bastard in two .
if he won't tell ya something , cut off one of his fingers .
the little one .
then tell him his thumb's next .
after that he'll tell you if he wears ladies underwear .
i'm hungry .
let's get a taco .
fuck .
jesus .
i'm blind , man .
i'm fuckin 'blind .
no , you just got blood in your eyes .
is he dead?
did he die or not?
let's go .
hold it !
get out !
get out of the fuckin 'car !
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , larry .
i can't believe she killed me .
who'd have fucking thought that?
hey , just cancel that shit right now .
you're hurt .
you're hurt real fuckin 'bad .
but you ain't dying .
all this blood's scaring the shit out of me , larry .
i'm gonna die .
i know it .
what the fuck happened?
he slashed the cop's face , cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive .
what?
i didn't hear you .
i said ...
blonde went crazy .
he slashed the cop's face , cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive .
this cop?
he went crazy?
something like that?
worse or better?
eddie , he was pulling a burn , man .
he was gonna kill the cop and me .
when you guys walked in , he was gonna kill you and run with the diamonds .
what'd i tell ya?
that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho .
you should've asked the cop , not just killed him .
he talked about what he was gonna do when he was slicing him up .
i don't buy it .
doesn't make sense .
makes perfect fuckin 'sense to me .
you didn't see how he acted during the job .
we did .
he's right .
the ear's hacked off .
let me just say this out loud , 'cause i wanna get this straight .
you're saying that mr. blonde ... was gonna kill you ... and then when we got back he was gonna kill us ... take the diamonds and scram .
i'm right about that , right?
that's your story?
i swear on my mother's soul ... that's what happened .
the man you killed just got released from prison .
he got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items .
he could've fuckin 'walked .
all he had to do was say my dad's name , but he didn't ; he kept his mouth shut .
he did his fuckin 'time like a man .
he did four years for us .
so , mr. orange ... you're telling me that this good friend of mine ... who did four years for my father ... who , in four years , never made a deal , no matter what they offered him ... you're telling me that now that he's free ... and we're making good on our commitment to him ... he's just gonna decide , out of the fucking blue ... to rip us off?
why don't you tell me what really happened .
what the hell for?
it'd just be more bullshit .
this man set us up .
dad , i'm sorry , but i don't know what's happening .
it's all right .
i do .
what are you talking about?
that lump of shit's workin 'with the l. a. p. d.
i don't have the slightest fucking idea ... what you're talking about .
joe , i don't know what you think you know , but you're wrong .
like hell i am .
trust me on this .
you've made a mistake .
he's a good kid .
i understand you're super fuckin 'pissed .
we're all real emotional .
but you're barking up the wrong tree .
i know him .
he wouldn't do that .
you don't know jack shit !
i do .
the cocksucker tipped off the cops ... and got mr. brown and mr. blue killed .
mr. blue is dead?
dead as dillinger .
how do you know all this?
he was the only one i wasn't 100 percent on .
i should have my head examined , going ahead when i wasn't 100 percent .
that's your proof?
with instinct , you don't need proof .
i ignored it before , but no more .
have you lost your fuckin 'mind?
i'm not gonna let you make a terrible mistake .
come on , guys .
nobody wants this .
we're supposed to be fuckin 'professionals .
larry , look ... it's been quite a long time .
a lot of jobs .
there's no need for this , man .
let's just put our guns down ... and let's settle this ... with a fucking conversation .
joe , if you kill that man , you die next .
repeat : you kill him , you die next .
larry , we have been friends .
you respect my dad and i respect you ... but i'll put bullets in you .
you put that fuckin 'gun down now .
goddamn you , joe ... don't make me do this .
larry , you stop pointin 'that gun at my dad !
i'm sorry , kid .
looks like we're gonna ... do a little time .
i'm a cop .
larry ...
i'm sorry .
i'm ... so sorry .
i'm a cop .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm ... sorr
freeze !
drop the fucking gun , buddy !
now !
put the gun down !
don't do it !
drop the gun , man !
drop the fucking gun !
we're gonna blow you away !
