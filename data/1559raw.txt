our lord , jesus christ , on the night he was betrayed
took bread , gave thanks
take , eat : this is my body which is given for you .
do this in remembrance of me .
likewise he took the cup , and gave thanks
for this is my blood of the new testament
which is shed for many for the remission of sin .

our father , which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven .

and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil .
for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever .

you're unwell .
i need to rest .
can't rev. broms take the service at frostnas?
no , he's taking the new car out for a spin .
i bet you have the flu .
my throat's pretty sore .
tomas ...
how did it turn out?
did you find a housekeeper?
no .
you won't be able to manage on your own in the long run .
i've managed for five years now .
why don't you ask marta lundberg?
she's dying to help you out .
i'd be glad to ask her .
no , thank you .
hello , reverend ericsson .
hello , mr. frovik .
hi there , aronsson .
hi , algot .
how are you?
thanks for the sermon .
can we help you with something?
not really ...
well , there was one thing .
i'd like to have a word with you .
i'll be at frostnas at three .
and you'll have time to see me?
of course , after the service .
i'll be at the church an hour beforehand , to turn the heating up .
will we be using the same hymns?
you appear to be unwell .
i've come down with a cold .
i bet it's the weather , i always ...
right .
he has his disabilty pension from the railway company
and a pittance for his services from the church council , i suppose ...
you have a visitor .
mrs. persson would like to have a word .
i've got to talk to you , vicar .
yes , of course .
i'll call you this evening , in case you need a hand .
please have a seat .
good bye , mr. and mrs. persson .
you wished to speak to me?
yes ...
but that's not the whole truth .
actually , jonas is the one ...
but he won't talk about it , and so ...
this morning i decided we should go to church , and see someone .
you see , we're feeling so lost ...
well , not me so much , but jonas is at his wit's end .
could you talk to him , please?
of course ...
how long have you felt troubled?
it started last spring .
jonas read about china in the papers .
the article said that the chinese people were brought up to hate .
and that it's only a matter of time before china has atom bombs .
they have nothing to lose .
that's what they wrote .
it doesn't worry me all that much ...
maybe that's because i'm short on imagination .
but jonas can't stop thinking about it , and so we discuss it constantly .
though i can't help him much .
not with three kids and one on the way ...
right .
everyone feels this dread ... ... to some extent .
we must put our faith in the lord .
we live our simple daily lives .
and atrocities rend our secure world .
it's so overwhelming and god seems so very remote .
that's right ...
i feel so helpless , i don't know what to say .
i understand your anguish ... but life must go on .
why do we have to go on living?
i shouldn't be bothering you with this .
and we're powerless to do anything .
let's discuss this ...
take me home and then come back here .
you and the vicar need to talk in private .
we live ten minutes away .
i'll see you in twenty minutes .
promise the vicar you'll be here .
all right , i promise ...
is your car in the parking lot?
yes , down at the corner end .
i'll be expecting you within half an hour .
i'll make sure he comes .
i'll be waiting for you .
i'll be waiting right here .
what a ridiculous image ...
oh , it's you .
here's something nice and hot .
oh , i brought coffee with me .
i'm expecting a visitor any minute .
don't worry , i won't stay long .
it's getting pretty cold out .
poor tomas ...
what is it , tomas?
it wouldn't matter to you .
god's silence .
god's silence?
god's silence .
jonas persson and his wife were here , and i could only spout drivel .
yet i had a feeling that each word was decisive , somehow .
what am i to do?
poor little tomas .
you should be in bed with a brandy .
you're running quite a temperature .
why did you take communion?
it's a love feast , isn't it?
have you read my letter?
no .
i haven't had the time .
you're hopeless .
when did it arrive?
yesterday .
it's on my desk ...
read it later , when you feel like it .
a sunday in the vale of tears i don't feel very well .
want me to feel sorry for you?
then you'll have to marry me .
oh?
you should marry me .
then i wouldn't have to leave this place .
why would you have to leave?
as long as i'm a substitute i can be transferred .
far way from you .
we'll see what happens .
yes , i know ...
you can't marry me , because you don't love me .
i've got to go .
aunt emma is here and she plans to bake a cake .
marta ...
what if mr. persson doesn't return?
then you can get some rest .
and read my letter .
you don't understand ...
what's the matter?
poor tomas .
i'm not being very nice to you .
god's silence .
there's no word from god .
god doesn't exist !
it's as simple as that .
now you'll come down with the flu .
that's fine , seeing as it's a gift from you .
would you like me to stay?
no , that won't be necessary .
you have a lot to learn .
says the schoolmarm .
you must learn to love .
and you can teach me that?
not me ...
i don't have magic powers .
he has to show up !
my dearest ...
we find it difficult to talk to each other .
we're both rather shy .
and i tend to retreat into sarcasm .
that's why i'm writing ...
i have something important to say .
remember last summer , when that awful rash broke out on my hands?
one evening we were in church arranging flowers on the alter .
preparing for a confirmation .
do you recall what bad shape i was in?
my hands all bandaged , and itching so i couldn't sleep?
the skin had flaked off and my palms were like open sores .
we busied ourselves with daisies and cornflowers , or whatever they were
and i was feeling irritable .
and i challenged you angrily .
asking you if you actually believed in the power of prayer .
you replied that you did .
nastily , i asked if you had prayed for my hands .
but it hadn't occurred to you to do so .
i melodramatically demanded that you do it then and there .
oddly enough , you agreed .
your compliance enraged me and i tore off the bandages ...
you remember the rest ...
the sight of those open sores affected you .
you couldn't pray , the entire situation disgusted you .
i understand your reaction , but you have no understanding for me .
we had lived together for some time at that point .
almost two years .
this could have represented capital in the face of our emotional poverty .
our caresses and clumsy attempts to evade the lack of love between us .
when the rash spread to my forehead and scalp
i soon noticed how you avoided me .
you found me distasteful .
even though you tried to spare my feelings .
then the rash spread to my hands and feet .
and our relationship ended .
this came as a shock to me .
i had to face the fact
that we didn't love each other .
there was no way to hide from this fact , or to turn a blind eye to it .
tomas ...
i have never believed in your faith .
mainly because i've never been tortured by religious tribulations .
my non christian family was characterized by warmth
togetherness and joy .
god and jesus existed only as vague notions .
and to me , your faith seems obscure and neurotic .
in some way cruelly overwrought with emotion , primitive .
your peculiar indifference to jesus christ .
and now i'm going to tell you about answered prayers .
laugh , if you feel like it .
personally , i don't believe the two are connected .
life is messy enough , without taking the supernatural into account .
as you recall , you were going to pray for my weeping hands .
but the rash left you dumbstruck with distaste , something you later denied .
i went berserk and wanted to provoke you .
be quiet !
since you can't pray for me , i'll do it myself !
god , why have you created me so eternally dissatisfied?
so frightened , so bitter?
why must i realize how wretched i am?
why must i suffer so hellishly for my insignificance?
if there is a purpose to my suffering , then tell me .
so i can bear my pain without complaint .
i'm so very strong , both in body and soul
but you never give me a task worthy of my strength .
give my life meaning , and i'll be your obedient slave .
this autumn , i realized that my prayers had been answered .
i prayed for clarity of mind , and i got it .
i've realized that i love you .
i prayed for a task to apply my strength to , and i received one .
that task is you .
this is what the thoughts of a schoolmarm might run to
when the phone refuses to ring on a dark and lonely night .
what i lack entirely is the capacity to show you my love .
i haven't a clue how to do it .
i've been so miserable i've even considered praying some more .
but i still have a shred of self respect left in spite of it all .
my dearest tomas ...
this turned out to be a long letter .
but now i've put down in writing what i never dared say
when you were in my arms .
i love you .
and i live for you .
take me and use me .
beneath all my false pride and independent airs
to be allowed to live for someone else .
and i suffer .
when i think about it , i can't see how i will be able to pull it off .
maybe it's all just a mistake .
please tell me it's not a mistake , my dearest .
i'm so glad you came .
it's been a long wait .
i'm sorry i'm late .
i didn't mean to reproach you .
please , take your coat off .
i've got some nice hot coffee .
no , thank you , i'm fine .
i don't expect you spend much time at sea this time of year?
we just take short fishing trips , that's all .
plenty to do ashore?
yes , i'm building a new boat .
over at tornstrom's yard .
an excellent establishment .
i had my own boat built there , at tornstrom's yard .
do you have money worries?
forgive me for asking , but things like that can drive a man to despair .
that's true ...
how long have you considered taking your own life?
i'm not sure ...
a long time .
have you spoken to a doctor?
i mean , are you in good health?
as far as i know .
it's not unusual to ...
do you get along with your wife?
karin's all right .
she's all right .
so it all boils down to this business about china ...
listen , jonas .
i'm going to be frank with you .
my wife died four years ago .
i loved her .
my life was over .
i'm not afraid to die and there was no reason for me to hang on .
but i did .
not for my own sake , but to be of some use .
i had great dreams once .
i was going to make my mark on the world .
the sort of ideas you have when you're young .
i knew nothing of evil .
when i was ordained , i was as innocent as a babe .
then everything happened at once .
i was a seaman's pastor in lisbon during the spanish civil war .
i refused to see what was going on .
i refused to accept reality .
my god and i resided in an organized world where everything made sense .
and i ...
you see , i'm no good as a clergyman .
i put my faith in an improbable and private image of a fatherly god .
one who loved mankind , of course , but me most of all .
do you see , jonas , what a monstrous mistake i made?
an ignorant , spoiled and anxious wretch makes a rotten clergyman .
picture my prayers to an echo god
who gave benign answers and reassuring blessings .
every time i confronted god with the realities i witnessed
he turned into something ugly and revolting .
a spider god , a monster .
so i fled from the light , clutching my image to myself in the dark .
the only person i showed my god to was my wife .
she supported me , encouraged me and helped me ...
patched up the holes .
our dreams .
i'd better be going ...
no , don't go .
i want you to understand why i'm telling you this .
so you realize what a wretch i am , what a poor beggar ...
i must be going , or karin will be worried .
please , stay a little bit longer .
let's have a nice , calm discussion .
forgive me for talking in such a confused manner
but all this suddenly hit me .
if there is no god , would it really make any difference?
life would become understandable .
what a relief !
and thus death would be a snuffing out of life .
the dissolution of body and soul .
cruelty , loneliness and fear ... ... all these things would be straightforward and transparent .
suffering is incomprehensible , so it needs no explanation .
there is no creator .
no sustainer of life .
no design .
my god ...
why have you forsaken me?
i'm free , free at last .
i had this fleeting hope ...
that everything wouldn't turn out
to be illusions , dreams , and lies .
i have to get ready .
the service at frostnas starts at three .
i'm coming with you .
no .
i saw your car , vicar , so i came over .
fredriksson's boys found him .
just down the hill .
it's jonas persson .
he's shot himself in the head with his rifle .
the police superintendent is at the scene .
the boys reported it immediately .
i met them on my way here , they were terrified .
could you please guard the body until the van arrives?
goodbye .
please call me .
do you have any aspirin?
sure , and some cough mixture , too .
but isn't your aunt visiting?
wait in the schoolroom then .
hello .
who's boy are you?
the strand's .
how old are you?
ten .
what brings you here?
i left something in my desk .
what's the dog's name?
jim .
is he yours?
no .
is he your big brother's , the one who's being confirmed this year?
will you go to confirmation class too?
why not?
i don't know ...
does your brother find it boring?
i don't know ...
well , goodbye then .
goodbye , sir .
hello , johan .
what brings you here?
i left something in my desk .
how's your brother , pelle?
he's much better .
he'll be back in school next week .
good .
give my love to your folks .
careful , that's hot .
it's really for gargling with .
you dissolve the tablets in hot water .
auntie gave them to me .
she swears by them .
my aunt is often troubled by sore throats and these really help .
suit yourself , here's the aspirin .
would you like some cold water?
that won't be necessary .
you sound so unfriendly .
sometimes ...
sometimes you sound ... as if you hated me .
take the whole box if you like , auntie arrived well stocked .
can't i come to frostnas with you?
i'm going to the persson's place .
i'll wait in the car .
i thought your aunt baked a cake?
i need some time on my own .
are you trying to get rid of me?
don't do this right now .
i don't have the strength .
why do you want to get rid of me?
my dear little tomas , you're getting old .
you're dissatisfied with life , but most of all with yourself .
and here i am throwing myself in your arms , clouding the issue ...
or am i forcing it?
you be the judge .
you have your dreams , and i pay no attention to them .
at times i even despise them .
i should have been kinder .
those are just trivialities .
no , you've been unlucky .
i'm so very bossy .
don't bother contradicting me .
could you just listen to me?
sorry , i'm doing all the talking .
i feel humiliated by the gossip .
no one used to care much about the cleric .
he was a simply a fixture ...
though no one knew exactly what he was good for .
then the rumors began , about you and me .
all that tittle tattle .
so that's your reason?
you don't have to sneer at me .
well , marry me then .
no .
it's hard to plead one's own cause .
yes , it certainly is .
you can't ...
you mustn't push me away .
how can you be so blind?
don't get hysterical .
that's what you always say whenever you see me crying .
i suppose i am a tad hysterical .
don't alarm your aunt .
i can't hold back the tears .
just go on talking , i can still hear your every word .
i thought i'd figured out a good reason .
i mean all that about a vicar's reputation , but you didn't bite .
and i understand that , since it's a pack of lies .
the reason that matters is that i don't want you .
did you hear that?
yes ...
of course i did .
i'm tired of your loving care .
your fussing .
your good advice .
your candlesticks and table runners .
i'm fed up with your short sightedness .
your clumsy hands .
your anxiousness .
your timid ways in bed .
you force me to occupy myself with your physical condition .
your poor digestion , your rash ...
your periods , your frostbitten cheek .
once and for all i have to escape this junkyard of circumstance .
i'm sick and tired of it all , of everything to do with you .
why haven't you told me this before?
because of my upbringing .
i was taught to regard women as beings of a higher order .
admirable creatures , unimpeachable martyrs .
and your wife?
i loved her .
did you hear that?
i loved her .
and i don't love you , because i love my wife .
when she died , so did l .
i couldn't care less what happens to me .
am i making myself clear?
i loved her , and she was everything you could never be
but that you insist on trying to be .
the way you mimic her behavior is such an ugly parody .
i didn't even know her .
i'd better be going .
before i spout even worse bits of senseless drivel .
could it get any worse?
stop rubbing your eyes like that .
sorry ...
stare all you like .
i can take it .
i can barely see you without my glasses .
you're all fuzzy .
and your face is just a white blob .
you're not really real .
yes , i see that i did it all wrong .
from the beginning .
i've got to go , i have to talk to mrs. persson .
every time i've hated you
i've made an effort to turn it into compassion .
you can't make it on your own .
you won't survive , tomas dear .
nothing can save you .
you'll hate yourself to death .
can't you leave me alone?
can't you just shut up? !
would you like to come along?
do you really want me to?
or is that fear talking?
suit yourself .
but i am asking you to come .
of course i'll come .
i don't have much choice , do l?
auntie , i'll be back by six .
she must be asleep , i'll just go check the stove .
your husband is dead , mrs. persson .
they've taken him to the infirmary , but there's no hope .
he shot himself .
so , i'm all alone ...
shall we read from the bible together?
no , thank you .
i've got to let the children know .
i'll be in all evening , if there's anything i can do for you .
i'll come by some time this week , to make funeral arrangements .
i spoke to him , but there was so little i could do .
i'm sure you did what you could , sir .
it was my parents dream that i become a clergyman .
well , hello there .
those bells tolled twenty seconds too long .
it's a nuisance , but i was busy replacing the candles .
i usually turn on the bells , light the candles
and make it back in time .
but today i bungled it .
an unfortunate mishap .
but those candles were tricky to light .
and i guess my broken down body is slowing down my actions .
the reason hardly matters .
i leave the temple in semi darkness until just before the bells start .
electric lights disturb our spirit of reverence .
don't you agree , miss lundberg?
you asked to have a word with me .
yes , about a rather urgent matter .
once , when i complained about my pains keeping me up nights
you suggested that i read ... ... to distract myself .
i began with the gospels .
and real sleeping potions they were too , if i may say so .
in between whiles , that is .
now i've got as far as the story of christ's passion .
and it's given me a pause .
so i figured i'd discuss it with you , rev. ericsson .
i feel compelled to do so .
the passion of christ , his suffering ...
wouldn't you say the focus on his suffering is all wrong?
what do you mean?
this emphasis on physical pain .
it couldn't have been all that bad .
it may sound presumptuous of me
but in my humble way , i've suffered as much physical pain as jesus .
and his torments were rather brief .
lasting some four hours , i gather?
i feel that he was tormented far worse on an other level .
maybe i've got it all wrong .
but just think of gethsemane , vicar .
christ's disciples fell asleep .
they hadn't understood the meaning of the last supper , or anything .
and when the servants of the law appeared , they ran away .
and peter denied him .
christ had known his disciples for three years .
they'd lived together day in and day out
but they never grasped what he meant .
they abandoned him , to the last man .
and he was left alone .
that must have been painful .
realizing that no one understands .
to be abandoned when you need someone to rely on
that must be excruciatingly painful .
but the worse was yet to come .
when jesus was nailed to the cross
and hung there in torment
god , my god !
why hast thou forsaken me?
he cried out as loud as he could .
he thought that his heavenly father had abandoned him .
he believed everything he'd ever preached was a lie .
the moments before he died , christ was seized by doubt .
surely that must have been his greatest hardship?
god's silence .
yes ...
no service today !
not a soul turned up .
you don't count : you belong , so to speak , in the sheep pen .
so , how are you doing?
that vicar you're running after , isn't worth much .
don't deny it .
you don't think a spinster can be choosy .
marta , for your own sake ...
you can leave this place , so get out as quickly as you can .
everything at mittsunda and frostnas is in the grips of death and decay .
take me , for instance .
remember when i used to arrange musical soirees?
on that pile ofjunk upstairs?
i gave concerts .
and the things tomas achieved .
people actually attended church .
but his wife was his undoing .
that got your attention , didn't it?
the little woman ...
and tomas was no judge of human nature
he only had eyes for her .
he was besotted .
well , marta , so much for their love story .
god is love , and love is god .
love proves the existence of god .
love is a real force for mankind .
you see , i know the drill .
i've been an attentive listener to the vicar's outpourings .
bye bye , you old turtledove .
get out while you can .
hello , you tubercular old wheezer , don't pass your flu on to me .
will there be a service?
i don't feel well .
florence nightingale is out there waiting to minister to your needs .
personally , i'd like to get some shut eye .
i'm playing tonight at the masonic lodge , you see .
what's your opinion , algot?
don't have one .
i'll go upstairs to the organ .
algot can give me a sign when the bells stop ringing .
well?
there's no one but miss lundberg out there .
if you pardon my wording ...
it's time to start the service bell .
that usually brings them in .
if only we could feel safe .
and dare show each other tenderness .
if only we had some truth to believe in .
if only we could believe ...
shall we have the service , then?
holy , holy , holy is the lord of hosts .
the whole earth is full of his glory .
