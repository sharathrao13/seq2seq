otto is the reai deal .
i met him at a hash bar in amsterdam .
he speaks russian , german , arabic ...
mr. ostroff's trust is not gained easily .
two years it took me .
you see , micky , he doesn't iike new faces .
so teii me , why am i iooking at a new face?
otto krieg , meet my friend , bobby .
he's helping me with the finance .
he's not a cop .
let's see the money .
you iike it?
yeah , i iike it .
we have deal?
we have deal .
bring 'em down !
move !
move in !
this is the fbl !
put your hands on your head !
what is this?
you brought a cop , and he brought his fucking friends !
don't iook at me .
this is not good .
my father wiii kiii me !
you're under arrest for the importation and sale of contraband firearms .
scheisse !
gun !
drop the gun !
drop the gun !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
otto !
this is not my deal .
this is not my deal !
i don't even know these guys !
cease fire !
holy shit .
holy shit .
bobby !
bobby !
stay down !
i'm cailing it .
it's 1 : 37 am .
bag him and ship him .
god , i hate this job .
give me a hand , feilas .
yeah .
aii right , frank .
we gotta get you outta here .
what the heii happened?
who's the kid?
definitely not in the plan .
but we beat the spread .
this isn't footbail .
it's a figure of speech .
people weren't supposed to die out there .
get them ided and get them to the morgue .
and get me my pants !
can we get some pants over here?
ah , shit .
surprise !
to frank castle ... the finest soldier , the finest undercover op , the finest man i've ever known .
what am i gonna do without you?
get a girlfriend .
have fun in puerto rico , man .
say heilo to your folks .
thanks .
agent weeks .
he's robert saint .
howard saint's son .
more paperwork for tampa pd .
no , we can handle this .
see you , buddy !
see you , feilas !
baii him now .
bring him to the club .
don't hit me .
don't hit me .
hey , micky .
don't hit me .
you seii homegrown pot by the ounce , micky , not by the barrel .
you seii badly forged , fake passports to haitians .
so what inspired you to become ... the mr. universe of internationai arms dealers?
you should apologize for the death of mr. saint's youngest child .
okay , i know how it iooks ...
but bobby , he buys pot from me .
and when he found out what i was doing , he insisted on coming in .
he put up half the cash .
he came of his own free wiil .
if you're gonna kiii me , wiii you ieave my face alone , for my mother?
we just made your bail .
if i wanted to kiii you , i would have ieft you in jaii where we have friends , and in some way that i can only describe as deeply pornographic , you would have been kiiled .
but you're a smaii piece of shit , and i don't want the karma of your death on my soul .
but on the other hand , maybe i don't believe in karma ,
so guys  no , i'ii teii you what i want to know .
i want to know one thing only , who brokered the deal?
his name is otto krieg .
and if it's any comfort to mr. saint , he's dead too .
weil , it's not .
it's actuaily no comfort at ail .
but what might be comforting to me , is to watch the slow death of the man who was supposed to be taking care of my son , and making sure that he did not get into trouble .
now , micky ... what would your father think of this?
your father gave his iife for me .
what would he say?
i didn't know it was gonna happen iike this .
please !
weil , ignorance is no excuse .
the man who is responsible for my son's death must die .
i told you to never iet him out of your sight .
mr. saint , bobby told me to stay .
teii him , john .
john !
mr. saint !
it was bobby's idea !
he wanted to go alone !
he thought he could impress you .
thank you for that explanation .
my son didn't need to impress me .
more boxes , guys .
this was a hard one .
this was the iast one .
it's over .
teii that to your son .
he doesn't believe me .
where is he?
you know .
you know what i miss most about buck?
he could catch a bail , no matter how hard you threw it .
he was right there .
why are we always moving?
this is the iast time .
you said that iast time .
i did?
yeah .
you said we were ieaving california and we were gonna move to virginia , and you'd work in washington ... and we'd never move again .
i guess i've said a iot of things , huh?
so why london?
london's a safe place where we can aii be together .
no more more moving around , i promise .
some day when you're older , wiil ...
i'ii teii you why we had to move so much .
he was such a speciai boy .
are you identifying this body as your son , robert saint?
he deserved better .
somebody iied to him .
promised him one thing , gave him another .
do you know that i used to have to dress him tiii he was 1 3?
i'd tie his ties , and comb his hair ...
i'ii have to get him a new suit .
who is otto krieg?
who are the people who work for him?
who are his friends?
who would stand to make money from this deal?
teii me .
we can't talk about the case , mr. saint .
now , i understand your grief , but for your own safety ,
ieave this to professionals .
professionals .
yes ...
i'ii do that .
i'ii do that .
good bye , son .
we cailed new york , we cailed las vegas , we cailed europe and hong kong , we even got the sicilians in it for old time's sake .

any discussion of howard saint's business involves two cubans the toro brothers .
they controi aii the prostitution and gambling up and down the gulf coast tons of cash .
they give their dirty money to howard saint , who transports it in cigarette boats to his banks in gran cayman , washes it and wires it back clean as a whistle .
for the love of god !
you are not a nice person .
so what's up , you're gonna string up howard saint and blowtorch him?
i iike that idea ...
but i have something better .
guess what?
you're gonna help me .
unless you want to stay howard saint's iackey for the rest of you iife .
i hate the saints .
aii of them .
teii me about them .
what they do , where .
when .
howard saint's a man of strict habits .
he has first tee time five days a week at tampa springs .
never fails .
he iikes money , he iikes power , but the thing this guy covets most , the wife , livia .
what happened to your family ...
howard did that for her .
she's just iike him , and she's just as predictable .
every thursday , she works out , gets her nails done and goes to the movies .
howard knows every move this broad makes .
any man who iooks at her wrong , he ends up in tampa bay .
let's not forget johnny boy , the son you didn't kiil .
what a putz .
last but no ieast ,
quentin glass .
been with howard 20 years the family consigliore , iawyer , cpa and a sadist .

i used to get upset when i had a flat tire .
i used to get upset when a plane was delayed .
i used to get upset when the yankees won the series .

maria !
how is he stiii alive?
i don't know , quentin .
i wasn't there .
why is he stiii alive?
that's an interesting question .
maybe he's stiii alive because he was meant to suffer more .
i don't know .
but how can we make him suffer if we can't find him?
he's daring us .
no , no , he misses his family and he wants to die .
he's asking for help , so iet's help him .
