previously on " alias " ...
someone now has the ability to detonate six nuclear weapons , and i am responsible .
so i am going to be part of the team that finds and disarms those warheads .
i need your help .
there are two things you need to know about this necklace .
it's layered with c 4 .
if you remove it while it's armed , you'll break the circuit , and it'll detonate .
if at any moment i believe you're attempting to escape or sabotage us ,
i'll activate this remote trigger and blow your head off myself .
hold it .
back up now !
is there something you'd like to tell us?
we'd like the warheads you've acquired .
thank you for the supplies .
of course .
absolutely .
mr. vaughn .
yes , sir .
mr. vaughn .
the necklace has been deactivated .
i'll have to call you back .
when?
just now .
you've confirmed this?
yes .
satellite imagery detects combat .
combat?
what just happened?
it's over .
can we tell if there's survivors?
not with this bird .
we need new satellites .
even if they survive , sending in a team is out of the question .
why?
they're on an authorized mission .
a clandestine mission .
if we start scouring the countryside , the indian government is gonna figure out that
pakistani supported rebels have acquired nuclear weapons .
they're gonna launch strikes .
the pakistanis retaliate .
i'm gonna get called in front of committees demanding to know why we screwed up !
the only thing we're interested in is how to make this problem disappear .
i want an options paper from you in two hours .
after that , i'd like to look for the bristows .
nuclear weapons .
i shouldn't have to define your priorities .
i don't think we should cut them loose .
alive or dead , the mission failed .
so if the bristows are out there , they're on their own .
hey , man .
check this out .
nothing like more bad news?
maybe they were a roving patrol .
no , prf rebels would never be this deep into indian territory without being dispatched .
your father's right .
we had one advantage .
surprise .
now that's gone .
just a second .
can't stop .
more patrols could be in the area .
what happened?
nothing .
i just scraped my leg .
dad , i can do it .
i got it .
you need to stop the bleeding .
where are you going?
these bushes .
they have myrtus communis berries .
their juice soothes the skin , helps healing .
you should put this on first .
seriously , i'm fine .
you're not .
no , you're not fine .
jack , i know you're determined to get to srinagar , but my contact in jaipur is much closer .
he's reliable .
he has good equipment .
this is a cla mission .
i have operational control .
you're a prisoner .
your only function , sole reason you're breathing air , is to use your knowledge of the rebels 'base to help us steal the suitcase nukes and leave .
that's why we're using people i know and trust .
i'm not having this conversation again .
you okay?
thanks .
this is not a power play .
the facility we're headed for , security's tighter than the nsa .
if i don't have the right equipment , it's pointless .
we should move .
i know what you're thinking .
do you?
the toaster .
what are you guys talking about?
we used to have this toaster at home .
it was broken , and using it one night ,
i started a small fire .
we had something like this to drink , and we both had a little too much .
i forgot about the toast i was making .
when was this?
you were 4 years old .
there was so much smoke , we had to move out for a week .
we stayed in that hotel .
summit .
wait .
was that the hotel with the sundaes?
i think you had one every night .
you should get some sleep .
jack?
i would have called .
i need your help .
yes , of course .
no one can see you dressed like this .
that's one of the reasons we're here .
it is good to see you again .
you too .
you look well .
imagine how bad i looked before .
are you who i think ...
is she yours?
yes .
he always brags about you .
he showed me a picture once ...
we need to penetrate a class a target outside muzaffarabad .
we'll need aliases , papers , transpo , ammo , sat phone , and security penetration .
yes .
would you like some tea?
no , thank you .
we also need tactical gear and night vision goggles .
yes ... except no .
my main supplier died two months ago .
saresh was killed?
heart attack .
we are old men , jack .
we don't live forever , especially in kashmir .
of course , i can provide aliases , basic weapons , access to satellite phone and transportation .
what kind of security?
biometric sensors .
dual infrared passive and microwave sensors .
fiber optics on the fence .
your timeframe?
none .
we're behind schedule .
well , i can do what i can do , but it might not be enough .
we'll take whatever you've got .
thank you .
yes .
first thing ...
you need to be looking not like you .
hi .
i'm on a secure line .
sydney .
we saw the blast .
what happened?
i'll fill you in later .
we were compromised .
i'm glad you're okay .
what about your parents?
some people go miniature golfing .
we go to india and look for nukes .
listen , sydney .
we intercepted a communication .
the rebels say they're activating the nukes tomorrow .
activate how?
we don't know .
deploy , detonate?
activate .
that's the word they used .
it might mean delivery , detonation .
we don't know , but we have to assume the worst since they got the control codes through sd 6 .
i got the control codes for sd 6 .
i can deactivate the nukes .
if you get there in time .
perfect .
here .
my truck is on the other side of the market .
i owe you .
what kind of air filter does it have?
a foam filter .
that won't work .
it'll clog up in the desert .
we'll return the truck as soon as we can .
it'll never get us there .
you think i'm second guessing you .
this is my decision .
it is not negotiable !
listen to me !
we have a job to do .
your issues are going to have to be dealt with later .
please excuse us .
right now we have six suitcase nukes that are going to be activated tomorrow .
is that confirmed?
cla doesn't have details .
they want us to deactivate the nukes .
cla needs to get authorization for a strike now .
they need confirmation the nukes are there .
it'll be too late .
not if we work together .
this is the way it's gonna be .
dad will decide how we get to the base .
it's his call .
once we arrive , mom takes over .
you know your way around .
you'll lead us to the nukes and back out .
then you'll resume control and get us home .
there will be no objections to and no deviations from this plan .
three of these are filled with grain .
irina , you'll be in the fourth .
you can't be serious .
she's the most likely to be recognized .
the rebels are looking for a 3 person team .
we have a better chance of avoiding detection if we alter our configuration .
you sure she can breathe in there?
dad , we need to get moving .
i know .
i'm just ... preparing myself to let irina out .
it'll be fine .
sydney , i've been doing this job a long time , so when you lectured me about continuing the mission ...
dad , my point was ...
i know what your point was .
the truth is ...
i needed to hear it .
i'm proud of you .
that's all .
thank you .
what are we doing here?
this is not the drop .
the filter got clogged , didn't it?
we're still 10 miles away from the base .
we need to hike to the field , where we'll access a sewage tunnel .
that'll lead us into the facility .
i thought you said security was heavy .
it is , on the other side of the facility .
at the entry point we're using , the rebels rely on land mines to keep intruders away .
we don't have the equipment to detect land mines .
we don't have the equipment because your contact didn't come through .
i know where the mines are .
you'll walk through a minefield you haven't seen in 19 years?
is there another way?
and assume no new mines?
i just spent five hours in a grain bin .
it's my turn now .
let's get to it .
i spoke with gerard cuvee , leader of the prf .
he's quite charming .
more like a banker than a rebel leader .
but you're a money man , too , aren't you?
is everything in place?
the nuclear cores will be activated at 1700 hours .
as soon as it's done , they'll upload the results to our server .
sir , i have someone calling regarding your wife .
they won't identify themselves .
record the call .
i need some privacy .
romantic touch .
your wife's ring finger .
by now , your lab's confirmed that despite your best efforts , you didn't kill emily .
and now i have her .
what do you want? $ 100 million in bearer bonds .
this is about money?
everything is about money .
instructions for the drop have been electronically mailed to you .
you've got 24 hours .
fail to deliver the bonds , and the next delivery will go to the alliance .
where did the prf get all these mines?
you americans have the worst inventory controls in the world .
so , sydney , how's school?
i'm writing my dissertation .
supposedly .
quiet .
behind the tree !
to your left , jack !
jack , i need a gun .
don't move .
you're on a mine .
sydney , don't move !
five steps forward .
three to your left ... and straight towards us .
are you hurt?
no .
the bullet hit my vest .
it's an m 26 anti personnel mine .
we'll need to pry off the panel and remove the blasting cap .
you need to cut the core that leads to the blasting cap .
her knife's not coated .
if she cuts with metal , she'll complete the circuit and set it off .
i can do it .
it's okay .
over that hill is the entrance to the tunnel .
we should hurry .
follow closely .
contact the bristows .
tell them to pull out .
i have no way of initiating .
why?
the indians found out the rebels have acquired nukes .
they're launching air strikes in 24 hours .
we have to get them to back off .
they're angry we knew and kept it from them .
they're insisting on going forward .
then let me make a personal appeal .
vaughn , everybody is working on this .
state , nsc , dod .
you're probably gonna say no to this ... but i want to go to india .
i was stationed there for two years .
i have relationships with ...
go .
go?
i'll have a military aircraft waiting .
this is totally back channel .
you're just gonna ...
are you trying to get rid of me?
clear .
we're here .
the nukes will either be in a sealed r& d lab or a vault located in the sub basement .
the lab's security system is more sophisticated .
so check the vault first?
not if we only get one shot .
the lab has thermal sensors to detect intruders through their body heat .
if we raise the room to body temperature , 98 . 6 degrees , the sensors won't be able to distinguish between us and the thermostat level of the lab .
sydney , you'll get to the central heating control panel .
it's located in a room near the stairwell in the sub basement .
find the panel for zone 3 .
got it .
jack , the lab door is controlled by a voice recognition system .
only cuvee's voice is programmed to open it .
we need to break into the main computer system here to access his file .
you'll erase his voice and substitute your own .
i'll be in cuvee's private office .
you and i are not separating .
not in here .
jack , listen to me .
unless i deactivate the facility's surveillance system from cuvee's office , we won't get anywhere near the nukes .
no .
you've done good work getting us here .
i'm not blind to that .
but i'm also far from trusting you .
if you want those nukes for yourself , this is a perfect setup .
you were an officer in this facility .
you've got friends here willing to work with you .
friends?
know what this place was when i was here , jack?
a prison .
where the kgb interrogated suspected traitors .
and , no , i wasn't an officer here .
i was a prisoner .
why do you think i learned the sewage tunnels or memorized the mine locations?
so i could escape , you idiot .
we're out of time .
we either split up and meet at the lab in five minutes , or we're going back .
it's your choice .
dad , she's right .
we don't have any more time .
i'll be in the lab in five minutes .
i promise .
you better be .
mera naam gerard cuvee .
mera naam gerard cuvee .
thank you for agreeing to this emergency meeting .
despite my best efforts to comply with your orders to kill my wife after she learned the truth about sd 6 , someone interfered .
and this person is now extorting me for her return .
last week , the blackmailers sent me emily's finger .
her ring finger .
lab tests confirmed emily was alive when they severed the finger .
blood coagulation tests are not 100 % accurate .
yes , but they are reliable .
then , two days ago , security section obtained those .
those are photographs of airport security in santiago and london .
and we have confirmed that emily was on flight manifests last week .
any idea on the men with her?
no , but the blackmailer wants $ 100 million in bearer bonds for her return .
who else knew about your instructions to kill emily?
only the people in this room .
you believe one of us may be behind this?
no .
but someone has infiltrated our secure communications .
well , whoever it is will get nothing .
no .
it's not quite that simple .
we have to eliminate this leak before more damaging information about the alliance gets out .
so i propose that we put a tracking device on the bonds .
that we make this exchange .
that we follow the blackmailer .
and we assassinate him .
you understand , arvin , after all this , if you get your wife back , she will still have to be eliminated .
i understand .
the thermal sensors are neutralized .
where's your mother?
i haven't seen her .
we got this far .
she must have gotten to cuvee's office and disabled the system .
she'll be here .
mera naam gerard cuvee .
we're not waiting .
use the control codes to begin deactivation .
the plutonium core is gone .
hi , mr. sloane , it's me .
marshall .
but ... sorry .
you probably already know that .
we planned this .
anyway , the tracer on the bonds is working perfectly .
good .
i'm turning off my comm .
i see you .
leave the briefcase on the bench and keep walking .
proceed toward the corner while we verify the authenticity of the bonds .
oh , yeah , i got you , baby .
right into my wheelhouse .
come on .
go to the row of vending machines .
take the " city view . " fifth from the top .
i told you , ain't nobody getting by
magic marshall's invisible liquid tracer .
i say , come on !
come on !
wait a minute .
wait .
no .
where did ...
oh , god , no .
no !
i think you understand the situation you find yourself in ...
not to brag , but i'm kind of responsible for matchmaking you and irina .
didn't she tell you?
i was a supervisor at the kgb .
i gave her the assignment to go to the u. s.
and marry a cla officer .
you weren't the only prospect , but you had the most potential .
i actually thought it would dawn on you that a woman like this would never go for someone like you .
luckily for me ... your ego was too big for that .
you're a dead man !
no , wait , wait .
i want what we came for .
sark's made a deal with us .
what kind of double cross is he planning?
maybe you didn't hear me .
we know sark has a new partner .
who is it?
get the information ...
and meet me in my office .
i was caught .
i had to do this , or we'd all be killed .
they're not detonating the nukes .
here's what you have to do .
is everything on target?
we ran into a few problems , but ...
what kind of problems?
we've got it under control .
we'll proceed as planned .
i'll expect your report within the hour .
trust me on this .
if you don't make it out , i'm sorry this happened .
mr. vaughn , good to see you again .
but i'm afraid you came a long way for nothing .
we have people at the prf base stealing the nukes .
if they fail , we'll be the pakistanis 'target .
they won't fail .
you can't guarantee that .
if you launch those strikes , you will be killing some of our best assets .
your government knew the rebels acquired the suitcase nukes .
they said nothing .
they place our country at risk .
at least delay a few hours until we get our people out .
i'm sorry .
the air strike goes as planned .
you look more like your father every time i see you .
my father wrote about you ... in his journal .
he wrote that he trusted you and respected you , and that is why i came such a long way .
i cannot call off the strike .
but i will give you a head start .
meaning what?
meaning a chopper and a pilot .
but if you're going to try to rescue your friends , you're doing so at your own risk .
dad !
shh !
how did you get free?
your mother is helping us .
what?
what about cuvee?
she was torturing you .
she was putting on a show for cuvee .
before she left , she put these in my hand .
she told me they're using the cores to activate a rambaldi artifact .
they're not detonating the nukes?
rambaldi experimented with self sustaining cell regeneration .
this artifact they're opening is reported to be rambaldi's proof of endless life .
we have no time to make any meaningful assessment .
your mother claims to have provided us the opportunity to contact the cla for extraction , and we should act on it .
can't this thing go faster?
this is it .
we're going against the wind .
operations .
this is mountaineer .
voice i. d. number alpha charlie 7 1 10 .
i need to speak with agent vaughn .
vaughn's not available .
let me give you kendall .
agent bristow , do you have the package?
we're in process .
we'll need extraction .
abort .
the indians have launched air strikes .
air strikes?
we're not finished .
get them to hold off .
fighter planes are in the sky .
you have to leave now .
not until we get my mother .
i am ordering you out .
head for the extraction point .
this is jack .
you'll either hear from us again , or you won't .
our assignment is to bring her back .
that's our job .
a flower?
that's what this is all about?
we need to get the cores and get out of here .
it's vaughn !
we've got the cores .
tell them to call off the air strikes .
this is agent vaughn .
abort the air strikes .
repeat .
abort the air strikes .
you must have a lot of questions .
one thing that should not wait any longer is why i shot you in taipei .
the rebel leader , gerard cuvee , when you were in taipei ... he was in the next room watching to see if i would betray him or you .
shooting you in the shoulder ... giving you time to escape .
it was the only way i could think to maintain his trust ... and keep him from killing both of us .
we're both tired .
you should get some rest .
you too ...
... mom .
hi .
any word on the flower?
preliminary analysis indicates that it's anywhere from 400 to 600 years old .
like i said , preliminary .
what's this?
