the beginning is always today .
one of my favorite quotes .
president wagner , what a pleasant surprise .
so , what ex citing new beginnings ... can we look forward to this year?
well , for the most part , i'll continue with ... the overall dire ction of the program .
that dire ction is a losing one .
i don't think we can measure the su c cess of our program ... by the number of people ... shaking their butts in the stands ... and no , we didn't win the b. e. t. classi c ... but our fiirst obligation is to edu cate ... and then entertain .
please , not the edu tainment spee ch, james .
save it for your students .
it's a good one .
the kids in my program are learning .
there won't be a program ... if the alumni continue to lose interest .
we win , they write che cks .
dr. henderson was smart enough to know that .
he played popular musi c .
that was james brown and marvin gaye ... not the thong song .
now , i will play popular musi c ... but not at the expense of musi cianship .
when you hired me ... you wanted me to strive for ex cellen ce ... and that is exa ctly what i am doing .
i also said we needed to win .
1 , 2 .
1 , 2 .
1 , 2 .
freeze !
i want your knees hitting your chest .
then drive your feet into the ground .
i'll say it again ! knees into chest !

ernest a ctually might get a chest .
and diedre might get strong enough ... to pi ck up a hot comb .
hold up .
hold up .
what are y'all lookin 'at?
drums ain't goin 'nowhere ... so what you clowns lookin 'down for?
always remember this .
playin 'the drums ... it's like makin 'love .
you can't be lookin 'down there ... seein 'what's going 'on , trying to get the fow right .

maybe you don't .
eyes on me .
yeah ... you know how it is ... when you hittin 'that spot , right?
don't ya , girl?
never look down .
that was impressive .
thank you , sir .
what i like most ... was instead of making sean look bad ...
look like a ja ckass .
let's take this from the top ... and this time , follow me .
don't look down , remember?
you have to learn to follow ... before you can lead , mr. miles .
congratulations .
you're not crabs anymore .
now you're crab drummers .
and tomorrow ... it's tree shaking eliminations ... whi ch will determine who will be come a& t drummers .
so tonight , celebrate ... 'cause you made it through training .
after you prove a thorough knowledge of the rule book .
what is mandatory of all a& t musi cians?
all a& t musi cians must read musi c .
when can a p 2 or p 3 ... challenge for a spot on the fiield?
at the pra cti ce before the performan ce , sir .
what is ...
last rule of the rule book?

tree shaking is going to rank you p 1 through p 4 .
but only p 1 s are guaranteed a spot on the fiield .
now , if you're a p 2 or a p 3 , you can still get a spot ... in se ctions that are available , so do your best .
i'll see you all on the other side .
who is that?
that's the upper classmen .

you the big dog .
do your thing .
no , i really think it'd help if somebody else played it .
i wouldn't do it no justi ce .
what are you two beavis and bla ck head?
it doesn't have to be perfe ct , devon .
i just want to hear it .
come on .
you kno cked that caden ce out i did ... in , like , a minute .
you got it .
go on , rip it , dog .
go on , dog .
let's go , devon .
what's wrong , d?
mr. miles , is there a problem?
don't feel like playing that wa ck ass caden ce .
yo , that was a bit ch move , sean .
it's obvious , if anybody bothered to pay attention .
personally , i don't give a damn ... if the boy can't read a book .
he's strong , and you know it .
have some respe ct for your se ction , robert .
snares have a standard .
it's my job to prote ct the line and that's what i did .
you don't like it , follow his ass out .
you lied on your appli cation ... you lied at your audition ... when you played the required pie ce ... and you lied to me .
i didn't think it was that big a deal .
play that .
that's the musi c for next week's game ... and you can't read it .
and as far as i'm con cerned ... that's a very big deal .
i'm enrolling you ... in the applied per cussion course .
man , that gives me 5 classes .
damn right it gives you 5 classes ... and it ought to be 1 0 ... espe cially if you plan on getting ba ck on the line ... anytime soon .
what you mean getting ba ck on the line?
i mean now you're a p 4 .
if you cannot read musi c ... you cannot be on my fiield .
man , you can't take me off the line .
i'm the best drummer you got .
ain't can't no class tea ch me how to do me .
ex cuse me?
doing me is what got me down here in the fiirst pla ce .
no , lying ... is what got you down here .
and if you don't have the honor and dis cipline ... to learn your craft ... then quite frankly , devon , you don't deserve to be here .
i don't get you sometimes .
if musi c is what you love ... why wouldn't you go to class?
you love dan ce , right?
why you ain't studying that?
my parents are paying for my edu cation .
and to them ... dan cing's not a real major .
well , is it real to you?
be cause when i see you doing your thing out on the fiield , you look happy .
that seems real to me .
it's not always about doing what you love ... all the time , devon .
see , i don't even get that , like , so why you even come to a& t?
i always knew i'd be here .
both my parents went to a& t.
my mom's a sigma phi alpha my dad's the all ameri can .
just ohh .
you'll meet them at home coming .
what?
brother's meeting the parents .
please take that class .
the s core's 1 4 to 1 0 .
and a& t university is in a third down situation .

this is how it's done .
dr. lee ... do you want to explain why devon is not on the fiield?
not really .
no , let me rephrase .
i want my boy on the fiield now .
there are some issues preventing that .
no , the only issue ... is for you to give me the same show ...
like you did the last game ... or there won't be a program next year .
i can't believe we ain't stepping to them fools .
that's a straight up challenge .
a& t going out like some punks .
is this how they make you earn your s cholarship?
mr. wayne , morris brown college .

but i bet dr. lee grounded you , didn't he?
a ctually , he ki cked me off the band .
i'm sorry to hear that , son .
but see , that's what happens ... when a talented brother like yourself don't have a real pla ce to shine .
uh , you know , mr. wade ...
i was wonderin 'if maybe you had a spa ce for me ... on your band next year .
that's a defiinite possibility .
but i want you to think very carefully about that
then you come ba ck and see me .
in the meantime , i'll talk to the coa ches ... about the s cholarship situation .
all right .
thanks .
all right .
look , i might as well tell you this up front .
what's that?
i can't really read musi c .
ha ha !
don't worry about that .
a lot of folks can't read the sign that says " toilet .
don't mean they don't know how to use one .
you want one?
ok .
just on ce , could a brother get a sli ce of pizza?
hi .
devon .
oh , snap , now you can see me?
look , i pani cked .
my parents were talking all that crap ... about " that hoodlum on the fiield that started the fiight , " and i just ...
devon , i'm i'm sorry .
it ain't about your parents .
you left me hanging .
you know how that feels?
no?
let me show you .
dr. lee?
dr. lee .
i just wanted to cat ch you before rehearsal .
i was thinkin 'that instead of promoting ... a p 2 to repla ce devon ... we might just keep the snare line at 9 .
and how long have you been thinking that?
just this mornin '.
are you sure?
i thought maybe it was the day you showed us all he couldn't read ... or maybe it was the night he took your solo .
i don't know .
but sin ce you heard him play ... you de cided that the line or perhaps maybe just you ... would be better off without him .
remember when i fiirst made you se ction leader?
you were sweatin 'bullets , wondering how you could lead ... this loud , passionate group of your peers ... and i said you would be fiine .
remember why?
you said i loved the sound of the line ... more than the sound of my own drum .
yes , and you've lost sight of that ... and that's ok be cause we all lose sight of things sometimes .
but if you don't get it together , mr. taylor ... you're gonna have a diffii cult time ...
leading the senate whether devon is on it or not .
now i put in a word with mr. hill ... to get you some fiinan cial aid next year ... hook you up with a part time job this summer ... put some money in your po cket .
you know you need some money , hmm?
hmm?
yeah .
yeah , everybody needs some money ... and the b. e. t. southern classi c comin 'up .
where you gonna sit , on the ground?
sit up in the skybox with us .

what you mean , what can i tell you?
what you mean?
what do i mean?
oh , i know dr. lee is workin 'on somethin 'big for the classi c .
the man's too damn stubborn ... to sit down and take ... his butt whippin 'like a man .
you know that .
i don't know .
there you go again .
you don't know .
at least a play list .
no , i don't have no idea .
lookie here , son ...
i'm talkin 'about throwin 'a lot of fiinan cial aid your way next year .
you need to give me somethin '.
meet me halfway on this thing .
you don't wanna pass up a deal like this .
look , man , i don't know what dr. lee got planned .
whatever it is , i hope he wipes y'all up with it .
fake ass alligator shoes .
hey , yo , d.

i just wanted you to che ck 'em out .
no , no , no .
let me see .

that's not a bad idea .
not a bad idea at all .
we're gonna try something ... a little different this year ... a little of my old s chool ... with a little of your new ... honoring the past and the present at the same time .
and that's what our new dire ction is all about
bridging the gap .
our new pie ce for the b. e. t. big southern classi c ... was arranged by 2 of your very own ...
mr. devon miles and mr. sean taylor .
this pie ce is very compli cated ... but it's not half as compli cated ... as the formations are going to be .
we won't have any time to waste here , people ... so as you would say ...
let's get crunk .
yo, jay , what are you doin ', man?
