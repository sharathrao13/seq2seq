ushi , are you there?
yes .
get something?
nothing but junk .
this is the best you can get?
burned kyoto .
the emperor's escaped to mt . yoshino .
no more big battles .
just skirmishes now .
can't do any business .
good millet !
one more .
take it or leave it .
want one more?
sleep with me?
who'd want you?
hachi !
you're back?
i'm hungry .
give me some food .
get him a bowl !
a wonder you got back !
my husband?
wait .
you came back alone?
i escaped !
where's my son?
it was the ashikaga army that made us go with them .
we fought twice .
the 3rd time , we got caught by the kusunoki army .
my son too?
yes , both of us .
so we became kusunoki men .
all the same to us .
not our war .
we didn't care who won .
there are two emperors now .
kusunoki fights for the emperor at mt . yoshino ...
ashikaga for the kyoto emperor .
it means the two emperors are quarreling .
at first we wanted to be heroes , but killing's not easy .
might get killed myself .
once i stabbed a man in the back with a spear .
he was in some bushes and i killed him .
my son?
it was 3 days ago ...
the kusunoki army was beaten flat at minatogawa .
wiped right out by the ashikaga men .
it was a mess .
couldn't tell friend from foe ... 2 days and 2 nights .
we tried to stick to the safest places .
the general ordered us to advance .
but we ran around till they chased us into a paddy field .
nothing to do but play dead in the mud .
we fooled them .
watching our chance , we ran into the mountains .
hid in the bushes all night , thought we'd starve .
we went to hunt for food .
thought we'd steal from farm houses , but they were empty .
no food .
soon , farmers with sticks came from somewhere and beat us up !
beat kichi to death !
i barely escaped alive !
my son was killed?
and then?
the samurai who took you?
killed right afterwards .
an arrow right through his throat .
here .
served him right !
had it coming to him .
they took my son so sudden , we had a hard time .
i was looking forward to the day he'd return .
only you came back .
it's a wonder you're still alive .
how do you eat?
frost in summer last year .
hail fell .
frost in summer , mind you !
the crops all failed .
strange things going on in kyoto too .
a horse bore a calf .
like the earth was turned upside down !
all the farmers are starving .
always fighting .
can't work .
the fields run wild with no men .
how do you eat?
never you mind !
we're beggars !
kyoto's burnt down !
not even a dog .
everything becomes food ...
snakes , even earthworms , mice .
wearing nice things .
steal them?
you look funny yourself .
i killed a priest on the way and put it on .
people trust a priest .
easier to get around in .
what'll you do now?
is my hut left?
i suppose so .
i see .
i'll go get some good sleep .
i'm very sleepy .
i'm sorry i came back alone .
what is it?
it's sad !
a fine day .
makes war seem far away .
big fish you caught .
nothing to eat .
what do you eat?
don't seem to grow anything .
what do you do?
you steal?
i see .
that's it?
they all do where there's fighting .
they all steal in kyoto .
you steal too?
right?
why didn't you save my husband?
no time to !
about 20 farmers attacked us !
all i could do to get away myself !
waited for him?
poor girl .
what'll you do?
he's dead .
no use staying with the old woman .
mind your tongue !
you're young yet .
how about coming to see me?
want to?
a nice day .
hachi , what're you doing there?
catching fish .
got to eat .
you eat it .
take what's offered .
it looks good .
what did he say?
nothing .
he's no good .
not even sorry he's back alone .
he may've killed my son !
like an enemy .
don't be too friendly !
help !
help !
get the one floating away !
he's alive !
we can eat now !
expensive stuff !
how about it?
a good buy?
this all?
farmers are in the mountains .
had a hard time finding this much .
risky work !
sake !
you were lucky .
a wonder you're back .
good business you have .
only while the war lasts .
don't know how much longer .
a long time yet .
until one side's beaten .
even if it ruins the country .
it's a business with them .
birds too .
bring good stuff .
ushi's got himself a good business .
camps will snap up swords , halberds , and armors .
not enough to go around .
none for common soldiers .
they use wooden or bamboo spears .
a good business .
you two do a neat job?
how many did you kill?
we're us !
stay out of it !
hadn't you better let me join you?
i'm war trained .
i'll be handy .
we're us !
we can manage .
hate me for returning alone?
you're you .
go it alone .
make me her husband?
idiot !
don't be stupid !
we're turning in !
you go home !
the no good !
he's after you .
his eyes !
like a dog after a bitch !
sniffing after you .
stay away from him !
that one !
wants a woman !
i want a woman .
come over .
be waiting tonight .
hachi's after you .
don't get caught .
who is it?
who is it?
it's you .
you came?
hachi !
hurry !
hurry !
i get scared running through the reeds .
silly .
you make your living by killing people .
lazy no good .
enjoying his nap .
hachi !
what?
only you , is it?
like sleeping?
nice to nap .
it's too hot .
best to sleep in the daytime .
sleep with me?
an old woman like you?
stupid !
i'm not old inside .
come on .
try me .
i'll go and take a swim .
wait !
what is it?
something nice?
don't act so innocent !
what're you doing with my daughter in law?
what's that?
i'll slap you !
i saw you !
what'll you do?
she came to my place .
you asked her .
why not?
i'm a strong man .
i can't stand it !
another man's wife !
your son's dead .
you no good , coming back alone !
taking your friend's wife?
he's dead .
she needs a man .
and no wonder .
she's young .
it's natural .
not if you leave !
go away !
if i do , i'd be taken to war again .
i'll stay here .
then leave her alone !
i've an offer .
let her be my bride .
you've got your nerve !
my poor son !
can't ask a young man and woman not to be friends if they're neighbors .
if my son's dead , she's all i've got !
i couldn't get along .
couldn't even kill !
take her and i'd starve !
don't worry .
i won't .
just friends .
in the end , she'll desert me !
i'll tell her not to .
hachi , i'm asking you !
i can't kill without her !
you ask too much .
your son's gone it's selfish to hold her !
when the war ends , i can farm and manage .
till then .
no telling when it'll end .
if you just want a woman , i'd do .
how about me?
i don't feel like it .
you intend to take her?
don't you know?
i won't !
just friends !
you think so , but she'll leave me !
i can't help that !
remember that !
what'll you do?
i'll spear you asleep together .
she'll die too then .
old bag !
where to?
i can't sleep .
i thought i'd get some fresh air .
yes , it's hard to sleep tonight .
no wind at all .
no .
dreamed kichi returned .
my son may come back .
hachi saw him die .
he won't return .
hachi's a bad man .
he may've lied .
he wouldn't lie !
if kichi's alive , he'd return .
no use lying !
aren't you sad my son died?
i am , but he won't come back .
i'll find you a good husband .
be patient .
when the war ends , men will come back .
let's farm again then like we used to .
fighting !
more good game will come our way !
i'll help you .
a wild dog?
not much spirit for a wild dog .
it's after a mate .
you pest .
we'll skin you and eat you !
it's a terrible thing !
once in kyoto , i heard a great priest talk .
people , who sin in this world , go to purgatory when they die .
what's purgatory?
the dead are just ashes .
no , no , that's not so .
there are really hells , they say .
hell of fire , hell of fury , sinners 'hell ...
and the terrible mountain of needles and the pond of blood .
the punishment for sinful love is the heaviest .
souls with human faces grow four legs .
and fall into sinners 'hell .
then they're tortured with red hot irons .
a lie !
there's no hell !
there must be hells .
a great priest said so .
it's no sin what we do .
everyone does it .
with a couple , it's all right .
with couples ...
it's quite all right .
it's a terrible thing .
merciful buddha , merciful buddha ...
let's go to bed .
calm yourself !
i'm a human being , not a demon .
i've reasons for wearing a mask .
i'm a samurai of good family .
as you see , i escaped from the battle .
i became separated from my men .
i hope to return to kyoto but i'm lost in this field of pampas grass .
tell me the road to kyoto .
go straight north and you'll get there !
show me the way out of the grass .
you'll kill me after i take you?
what good is there in killing the likes of you?
go alone !
old woman !
you refuse?
i'll go !
i'll take you !
i missed you ...
i missed you so .
that old woman !
if we sin , do we go to purgatory?
sin?
people been doing this thousands of years .
i'd go to purgatory with you !
a vast field of grass .
can't tell what lives here demons or snakes .
and monsters like you stray in .
i'm a demon .
why do you wear a mask?
i look stronger with it on , don't l?
you lost , you're running from the war?
so it's useless to try to look strong .
you're right .
many of my men were killed and many others left me .
i was left alone .
punished for beginning a war !
old woman ...
would you like to know why i wear a mask?
i feared marring my face .
my face is beautiful .
the handsomest face in kyoto .
to protect it , i wore this mask and went into the thick of battle .
as a reward for taking you , show me your beautiful face .
you'd feel faint if you saw my beautiful face .
i've never seen anything really beautiful since i was born .
show me your face .
you wish me to so badly .
show me .
a face you'd fall in love with?
i've never seen anyone so beautiful it would take my breath away !
walk on , old woman !
it's not a face to show peasants !
walk faster !
or i will kill you !
you made many soldiers die?
a cruel thing .
the dead are the losers .
the dead can't come back to life again .
don't talk !
walk !
serves you right !
men like you killed my son !
how beautiful are you?
the most beautiful face?
this is a samurai general's face?
peace be with you here .
you have friends here .
you made others die .
now , it's your turn .
heavy?
no , not very .
shall i go along?
no , i'll go by myself .
but it'll be night when you return .
if it's dark , it can't grow darker .
i'll be late .
eat early and go to bed .
be careful .
what's the matter?
you'll catch cold going to sleep there .
what is it?
are you sick?
your face is pale .
anything wrong?
what's she doing anyway?
are there really demons?
well ...
in hell , i guess .
they're here too !
did you see one?
no , i didn't .
we've done nothing bad .
a demon couldn't take us .
might take a bad person though .
shall we eat?
shall i go to ushi's place?
too hot in the daytime .
night's the best time to go out .
ushi's a sly one .
if i take too many at once , he knocks down the price .
better to take a few at a time .
we make more that way .
i'll be on my way .
be careful .
what's the matter?
a dream?
what kind of dream?
you woke me up .
say .
standing me up .
what's up?
tired of me?
it's raining .
don't go .
can't let ushi fool me .
said he didn't have the millet on hand and to pick it up tonight .
just a shower , so it'll stop .
it'll become nice and cool .
i'll be on my way .
say !
hachi !
a demon !
demon?
silly !
no such thing !
a demon !
there can't be .
you imagined it .
there is .
i saw it .
a fox or a badger maybe .
even weasels fool people .
my head's clear again !
i wish we could live together .
i told you so !
come to my place .
ouch .
a bug in my back !
set yourself free !
i can't .
i may be punished .
for what?
buddha's punishment !
there's no buddha !
i'll come for you from tomorrow .
wait !
wait !
it's me !
i'm not a demon !
it's me .
it's me !
you're ... !
it's me !
i'm your mother !
then that demon every night ...?
yes !
it was me !
i was wrong !
forgive me !
i wore the mask to scare you .
i'm being punished for it !
the mask won't come off !
why won't it?
why won't it?
why won't it?
it got wet in the rain and won't come off !
take it off !
why won't it come off?
why won't it?
why won't it?
look at you !
it's punishment !
please take it off !
take it off !
please ...
i didn't sin !
this proves it !
old meddler !
this proves it !
i was wrong !
i was wrong to meddle !
take it off !
you became a demon !
stay that way !
please take it off for me !
i'm asking you !
i'm asking you !
all right , but will you do everything i say?
i will !
i will !
i will !
exactly as i say?
yes !
yes !
yes , i will !
can i see hachi every night?
yes !
daytime too?
yes !
you won't complain about us?
i won't !
day and night !
you can !
sure?
i'm sure !
all right , i'll take it off .
it hurts !
it hurts !
what's happened?
hurry , take it off !
bear it even if it hurts !
it hurts !
it hurts !
the rain did it !
it hurts !
it's punishment !
it hurts so ...
it hurts .
it's that samurai's curse !
what?
understand?
put up with it !
i'm dying .
i'm dying .
it came off .
it came off .
it came off .
the mask came off .
demon !
i'm grateful .
that was good of you .
what is it?
wait !
i'm not a demon !
i'm a human being !
wait !
i'm a human being !
