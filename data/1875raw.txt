for my daughter mingxia
london , 2 : 30 pm
hi , mom .
hi , dear .
i have bad news .
your dad's prognosis isn't good .
you have to come .
did he ask you to call?
not in so many words .
we saw each other for 15 minutes last summer .
with his flat , bank account , insurance , the university ...
your sister's in australia .
it's too much for me .
i'll see if gaelle can come .
hi , love .
he's worse?
i have to be there .
i'll come .
the barbarlan invaslons
the body of christ .
the body of christ .
the communion's over here .
the body of christ .
how's mr desmarais?
i don't know .
i'm not mr desmarais .
sorry , the computer system is a mess .
constance lazure .
my wife louise .
must be hard having him here .
i threw him out 15 years ago .
so whether he's here or humping co eds in his condo ...
gimme a break .
you know it's been years since i humped a co ed
and raphaelle metellus?
she was dominique's student .
you were her personal tutor?
kneel down , open wide .
i'd best continue my rounds .
have a good day !
you too , sister .
i called sebastien to let him know .
you did?
aren't you glad?
lovely , we can play his video games .
he's still young .
ok , but couldn't he have read one book in his life?
any book?
is that asking too much?
he may not read , but he earns more in a month than you in a year .
thanks a lot .
that's ok , we had room .
it's flying to belfast monday ...
i'll probably have to stay longer .
my darling !
you must be exhausted .
what time is it for you?
2 a . m .?
gaelle , how are you , dear?
fine , thank you .
hello , sir .
young man .
do you remember gaelle?
gaelle is unforgettable .
how are you?
no private rooms?
i'm lucky i'm not in the hall .
i tried , all i got was voice mail .
dad's very sick .
please get in touch .
what i see isn't encouraging .
but to be sure i need a pet scan .
see if they can do it .
they can send it by satellite .
it stands for positron emission tomography .
sherbrooke has one , but there's a 6 12 month waiting list .
isn't he going to burlington today?
they have one , but it's expensive . $2000 u. s.
money's no problem .
you're lucky .
you never listened to my body .
but i'm not laying a guilt .
look , i have to get dressed .
an ambulance is taking me to burlington in 10 minutes .
no more excuses !
for my radiation therapy .
no !
the machines here are too old .
stop avoiding me .
this is my son , sebastien , he's going with me .
she's a woman i used to know , long ago .
i couldn't face coming alone .
you've never been here?
never .
but you see each other regularly .
always on neutral ground .
usually in restaurants .
did he come to your place?
occasionally .
but you never came here .
no .
this was where he brought his mistresses .
with luck , we'll find some panties .
i'm glad sebastien's going with him today .
it's important they talk .
christmas in the scanner , easter 6 feet under .
i have the scan .
it doesen't look good .
not good at all .
we can't be certain , but the margin of error is almost nil .
is he in a lot of pain?
why don't you bring him here?
at least he wouldn't suffer .
we'll make sure of it .
i'm sorry , buddy .
baltimore's not far .
7 hours by car , an hour by plane .
i won't go into exile .
wouldn't you like your own room with a bathroom , cds?
what cds?
so you can listen to music .
they have that in civilized countries .
know what that costs?
nothing .
i'll look after it .
i won't know a soul .
we'll all go tomorrow .
no we won't .
i'm not going to the states ,
i voted for medicare , i'll accept the consequences .
only idiots refuse to change .
i want to be with my friends .
your friends?
where are they?
dominique's away , but pierre ...
you've no one .
apart from that lunatic this morning .
which lunatic?
it's irrelevant .
my remy !
who's he talking about?
marlene dupire .
you didn't sleep with marlene dupire?
she's a certified nut , everyone knows !
you wrecked your family for her kind?
i wrecked nothing !
you ruined mom's life , my adolescence , sylvaine's ...
blaming me for her failure?
she loves the sea , she sails the world , delivering yachts .
beats a 3rd rate university .
you may be a millionaire , but you know nothing !
i know i won't end up like you !
she's the reason i'm here .
she raised me , not you !
don't you have a plane to catch to hong kong?
i don't need you , not for one second !
go to hell !
fuck you !
go to hell !
we're returning to london .
you can't .
we offer him the finest hospital , he refuses .
you heard him .
he'll never change .
you plan to have kids?
definitely .
until you're a parent you'll never understand .
he changed your diapers .
he called your teachers every month all through school .
he so wanted you to do well .
when you had meningitis at age 3 , he rocked you in his arms for 48 hours non stop , without sleep , to keep death at bay .
you can't remember that .
what should i do?
find his friends .
find him a comfortable room .
that shouldn't be hard .
the ministry forbids changing hospitals .
anyway , they'd park him in the hall in emergency .
the floor below is empty?
2 years , now .
could he move there?
ice cream with your pie?
you can always ask at administration .
good luck !
i'll leave you now .
you're lucky to have such a caring son .
you think so?
how many children come here?
look around !
see many children at their parent's bedside?
i'm here every day , so i know .
was your dad hospitalized?
did he die there?
in the end .
did you visit him?
he lived in chicoutimi , i was in montreal .
you came from england?
london , chicoutimi , for you ... same thing?
are you becoming confused?
when it's over , press end .
that stops it .
it's hard , but if you concentrate , you'll manage .
hi , dad !
see , the pacific ocean .
we sail from sydney to new caledonia , on to easter island and finally valparaiso .
i'm sending you lots of sea air .
they say it's good for your health .
i have to go .
satellite connections cost a fortune .
i'm sending you lots and lots of kisses .
bye for now !
security badge?
ms pelletier?
lloyd's of london .
didn't they give you one?
no .
last door on the right .
but next time you need a badge .
hello .
pauline joncas pelletier .
please have a seat .
so you're with lloyd's of london?
not at all , i said that to get in .
my father's here .
i'd like to move him to the empty floor .
set up something more comfortable .
that's wonderful !
it complies with our awareness programs involving family members .
but unfortunately our allocation of infrastructure is determined by the ministry's ambulatory thrust .
it's absolutely impossible to target our responses in terms of individual beneficiaries .
i'm sure our staff ...
i prepared this file .
you must understand , our resource allocation aims at prioritizing responses according to diagnostic parameters defined by the region 02 consultations .
this is silly .
we're not in the third world .
think it over .
even if we close our eyes , we'd require union integration .
and that is problematic !
i'll handle them .
this file will be updated weekly .
i'll come back tomorrow .
thank you !
there's a room on the empty floor .
it'll take 5 minutes .
i just want to show you .
i'll be back in 5 .
sorry , take the next one .
i want to set up a room on this floor .
we could ...
look , nothing happens without the union .
it starts and ends with the union .
understand?
i came to you , right?
you'd have to paint it , scrub the floor ...
just a sec , man .
you're talking overtime , you realize .
and my guys don't .
paid in cash .
cash?
cash .
one painter .
two .
six hours .
eight .
what's the rate? $40 . $35 .
i want a bed , curtains , chairs ...
look , man , we don't do that .
you hire a crew , supervise the work .
and charge me a reasonable fee .
reasonable?
let's say 25 % .
here's $2500 for starters .
we'll settle up every 2 days .
where's my laptop?
what?
my computer .
on the floor .
it's not there .
it must be .
nothing there .
the floor , not the locker .
i'm not crazy .
it's not there .
someone must have taken it .
who?
i don't know .
i've had 50 emails .
how'll i recover them?
my entire deal with norway .
there's no backup .
do you know what i do?
no .
you never told me .
why bother?
you never listen !
there were , what , 3000 dead .
historically , that's insignificant .
as a u. s. example , 50, 000 died at the battle of gettysburg .
what is significant , as my old prof said , is they struck at the heart of the empire .
in previous conflicts korea , vietnam , the gulf war the empire managed to keep the barbarians outside its gates , its borders
in that sense , people may look back on 9/ 11 , and i stress may , as the beginning of the great barbarian invasions .
alain lussier , thank you .
my pleasure .
excuse me , my computer was just stolen .
oh yeah?
fill out this form .
what for?
it's for the police .
look , i've had all these since monday .
the police ever investigate?
no , only when there's physical violence .
last week a woman was raped in the old laundry room , so they came .
otherwise they'd be here 24/ 7 .
it's easy to rob patients .
they're asleep half the time .
and the union protects the employees .
there's not much we can do .
ronald?
what can i do for you , pal?
i lost or misplaced my computer .
maybe in my dad's room .
so , on the off chance someone should find a laptop somewhere ...
we'll ask around , but i can't guarantee anything .
in case .
right , in case .
we'll check .
thanks , i appreciate it .
hello?
speaking .
of course i remember you , sebastien .
how are you?
yes , it's been a long time .
he's very sick .
and he's all alone , except for my mother .
i knew he was in hospital , but i didn't realize ...
i almost never come to montreal , so ...
is he still in hospital?
pierre , i need you , now .
school's starting , we haven't found a daycare , the kids are sick ...
that's life .
always the same .
i'll try to get a flight .
you say that because times are so terrible .
not especially terrible .
not at all .
contrary to belief , the 20th centaury wasn't that bloody .
it's agreed that wars caused 100 million deaths .
add 10 million for the russian gulags .
the chinese camps , we'll never know , but say 20 million .
so 130 , 135 million dead .
not all that impressive .
in the 16th centuary , the spanish and the portuguese managed , without gas chambers or bombs , to slaughter 150 million indians in latin america .
with axes !
that's a lot of work , sister .
even if they had church support , it was an achievement
so much so that the dutch , english , french and later americans followed their lead and butchered another 50 million .
200 million dead in all !
the greatest massacre in history took place right here .
and not the tiniest holocaust museum .
the history of mankind is a history of horrors !
they had a trial program with heroin .
see if it still exists .
heroin's 800 % more effective than morphine .
it makes a huge difference .
ok , thanks .
get some rest .
i will , good night .
are you pals with the premier , or a hockey star?
his son takes care of him .
i know .
and dumbo won't thank him .
my son is an ambitious and puritanical capitalist .
whereas i was always a sensual socialist .
sensual isn't half of it , sister .
lewd ! debauched !
bestial !
lascivious !
perverse !
how are you , you lusty sinner?
better !
give me a kiss , you randy snake !
you're back?
yesterday?
and alaska?
lovely and cold , like me !
you see , sister?
my exquisite daughter in law , my heroic wife , and two most charming mistresses .
i can die in peace .
you'll burn in the flames of hell .
and i won't be alone .
they're safe , but given the depravity of these two , they'll roast alongside me .
whereas you'll play the harp on a cloud for eternity , seated between john paul il , a surly pole , and mother theresa , a slimy albanian
his illness has affected his brain .
no , it's an ethnological truth , louise .
albanians are often slimy and poles are always surly . " for the misfortunes of poland are proof of god's existence !
hello .
i'd like to meet someone , a police officer or detective in the narcotics squad .
have a seat .
come stai , you big pig?
what are you doing here , old queer?
this is alessandro .
we've heard all about you .
gilles levac .
my partner , kim delgado .
have a seat .
thanks .
my father's hospitalized here in montreal .
he gets rotten care , of course , and he's in pain .
a doctor friend suggested i get him some heroin .
i know little about drugs .
as a student i smoked pot .
drugs are sold in every city , and the police know where .
i hoped , perhaps naively , you could recommend some spots where i can find high quality heroin .
that's fascinating , except that ... our job is to arrest dealers , not help prospective buyers . think of me as a smart guy trying to save time .
police help our journalist to buy narcotics .
i'm no ... she and i don't want to end our days directing traffic in chibougamau .
i swear i'm not a reporter .
why should i believe you?
i'm a market operator with macdougall deutsch .
it's easy to check .
it's easy to print phony cards .
sorry to disturb you .
i'll have to try the discos .
look , the citrouillard family !
claude , i don't believe it !
how are you?
heroin used to be for the rich .
now prices have dropped and that's changed .
but traditionally it's the drug of musicians and poets ...
you mean , ask my friends?
i don't mean anything .
i'm repeating rumors circulated in the media .
ok .
what exactly do you do?
my dear , i'm the director of the canadian university institute of rome .
what exactly does it do , the canadian university institute of rome?
in fact we're a leading cultural agency that assists canadian university students in rome .
and how many canadian university students are there in rome?
in fact , a few .
why do you ask?
we like to know how our taxes are being squandered .
we're a very modest operation .
naturally the director requires paid housing ... ... where you're always welcome , of course .
you haven't been hit by cutbacks?
quite impossible .
the institute is buried in the budgetary quagmire of foreign affairs .
the minister himself has no inkling we exist .
who should i have slept with to get that job?
i'm afraid that people i slept with would've been blind to your charms , however abundant they are .
abundance has it fans , dearie .
not in foreign affairs .
this it?
someone found it somewhere?
that's it .
i have to get heroin for him .
i need someone with contacts .
i've been away too long .
the only poweder i sniff now is baby's own .
i could try to ask my daughter .
remember nathalie?
yes , a little .
i can't promise anything .
i rarely hear from her .
hi , sweetheart .
it's mom .
it's diane .
i miss you , sweetheart .
look , remember sebastien , remy's son?
you often played together as kids .
he wants to meet .
he needs some information .
so call whenever you like , at any time .
if you prefer not to talk to me , i'll leave you his number .
we have to hit costco before 6 .
we need a shitload of diapers .
children cost so much .
why do people in the third world have so many?
what a dumb thing to say .
your poor students , if you teach such crap !
did you get that book i mentioned?
which one?
inner healing by swami rapudanthra .
no , unfortunately not .
i'll bring it .
your body's in your head .
illness starts and ends in the head .
i keep telling pierre that .
well , we'll be going .
see you soon .
how old is she?
it's not about age .
her breasts outweigh her brain .
cut it out .
it's true !
the quantity of blood they require drains the brain .
it's physiological .
no wisecracks .
she's given me two girls who've transformed my life .
and a mere brush of her hand makes me as hard as a bull .
which you'll agree is a godsend at our age .
nathalie?
i didn't recognize you .
come .
do you work full time?
what do you do?
proofreader .
for a publishing company?
boreal press .
so your hours are flexible .
my proposal is that i pay for your supplies , as well as my father's .
want brown or white?
i've no idea .
to smoke or shoot up?
i trust you .
you shouldn't .
why not?
you should never trust a junkie .
they make a habit of lying .
it's right there .
how much? $500 .
it's pretty chilly , huh?
that girl's innocent .
she's doing me a favor .
arrest me , but forget her .
arrest you?
think i'm a fool?
not at all .
you located olivier in two days .
nice going .
olivier?
the dealer .
why not arrest him?
want me to arrest everyone?
recognize him?
he's michel richer , the biologist .
you never bust suppliers?
all the time .
we work 2, 3 years , bust an iranian gang .
and then iraqis took their place .
or the lebanese , turks , italians .
there's too much demand .
it's an invasion .
what are you doing here?
i mean , now?
my job .
i see .
keeping the peace .
the fish are biting in zampino's pond .
time to go fishing .
what did you study?
why do you ask?
curious .
criminology , minor in psych .
you?
mathematics , minor in economics .
take care .
you too .
you don't remember me?
no .
i was close to your mom .
you mean you slept with her?
not just that .
were you married?
yes .
the married ones never stayed till morning .
i'd see them if i woke up at night .
from a child's perspective , it must seem sordid .
we called it sexual liberation .
what's that?
heroin .
it comes from opium , right?
it's morphine mixed with chemicals .
will you inject it?
we'll start inhaling and then see .
it's incredible to ...
be quiet now .
try to concentrate .
the first time is the best .
it's the one you long for .
it's called riding the dragon .
morning .
good morning .
it smells .
have you been smoking?
not on your life .
i light a candle and meditate .
where's your iv?
dr levesque had it removed .
good morning , my doctresses .
take a deep breath .
does it hurt here?
oh , yes .
and here too?
there too , yes .
is it unbearable?
goodness , no !
you're in high spirits .
couldn't be higher !
how do you sleep?
like a baby .
then i won't prescribe painkillers .
forget it !
that's wonderful .
i always say , the longer they stay lucid , the better .
i plan to remain lucid till i die .
wonderful , mr paranteau .
thanks so much , dr. dube .
i'm not dr. dube .
how fitting , because i'm not mr. parenteau .
who's he?
so it all started with maria goretti .
exactly .
the girl who said , no !
which one was maria goretti?
a portuguese peasant .
portuguese?
santa maria goretti !
she was italian?
from nettuno .
portugal , that's fatima , the apparitions , the virgin , the shepherds .
the secret of fatima .
which only the pobe could hear .
poor canada , in 1960 .
look , we believed it .
so they filmed the edifying life of maria goretti .
starring?
i've racked my brains .
ines orsini .
of course !
the immortal ines orisini !
how could i forget?
i saw it at school in padua with the jesuits .
me , the jesuits at brebeuf .
me , at the chicoutimi seminary .
for the whole film the immortal ines orsini is covered from head to toe .
but at some point they had to at least suggest the abject nature of the bestial desire of the vile rapist .
so the exquisite maria dips her adorable toes into the ocean .
with a regal but modest gesture , she lifts her skirt ...
the thighs of ines orsini !
even i remember !
oh , the rivers of sperm i spilled dreaming of her thighs .
so that explains the rise in the level of the st. lawrence river .
for years i'd fall asleep with a hard on , dreaming of ines orsini , until the day i saw francoise hardy on tv singing all the boys and girls .
i was suddenly indifferent to ines's holy airs .
maria goretti , alone , abandoned the fate of womanhood
for a long time i slept with francoise hardy .
we were very happy .
alas , i discovered julie christie in a film .
our mad affair lasted six months , till i met chris evert , the tennis champ , whom i left for the sublime karen kain dancing carmen in marseille .
all my life i went to bed with the world's most gorgeous women .
then one morning i awoke realizing i'd fallen asleep dreaming of the caribbean .
i'd grown old .
women had deserted my dreams .
it's been so long since i dreamed of a man .
just what is it you do?
you're president of a norwegian oil firm .
you've bought a north sea oil field from a failing u. s. company .
you can produce oil for $7 per barrel , and you sell for $25 .
but you want to limit your exposure to fluctuating oil prices .
how?
no idea .
you see me , we do a swap .
what's that?
a deal where my bank pays you a set price and you pay the floating price .
you contract to sell your oil at a set price for a set period .
in short ,
i manage financial risk .
are you good at what you do?
pretty good .
could you get the driver to stop at the lake?
probably .
i'd like to see it again .
at berkley i did my phd alongside locken and donaldson , two future pulitzers .
they were no better than me , but they were american .
me , i came back here , i started to teach , got married ,
and then ... then nothing .
your women kept you too busy .
that was small time , like you said .
no , what i lacked was extravagance .
i went in for pathetic trysts in poorly heated east end flats .
i was replaced by a ta within 48 hours .
the dean neglected to say goodbye .
the lowliest secretary gets a cake for maternity leave .
ladies and gentlemen , for health reasons i'll be unable to complete this term .
ms raphaelle metellus will replace me .
does this affect our deadlines?
no , deadlines and exam dates remain unchanged .
any other questions?
good luck .
thanks .
so , as you saw last week , the 1840 election was particularly stormy .
the whig party , then newly formed , united four distinct constituencies
first , the national republicans , followers of adams and clay , the party founders .
irina's home , i have to go out .
is nathalie buying for you?
she's a friend .
if you're a regular , maybe we should deal directly .
it's only temporary .
everything in life is temporary . " you can never swim in the same river twice , " said ... what's his face?
you know ...
you can't count on nathalie .
she'll pull a fast one on you .
we'll see .
you know where i live .
sure .
what are you doing?
i was waiting for you .
you're always on my mind .
i know , you've told me .
at night i picture you bleeding in an alley , in shooting galleries .
i'm always so scared .
it's unbearable .
you imagine too much .
you know this can't go on .
of course i know .
i know it better than you .
i know it's my fault , that's what's killing me .
that doesn't change anything .
i don't need this .
you don't care much about living , do you?
not really .
i was like you at your age .
ready to die at any time .
i didn't care .
that's why the young people make the best martyrs .
i've got 20 years left , 15 , 10 .
when you realize it's for the last time .
i'm buying my last car .
this is my last trip to genoa , barcelona ...
i won't live that long .
how do you know?
overdoses are pretty frequent .
but you can never tell .
maybe you'll kick it and reach a ripe old age .
we can't decipher the past , how can we know the future?
no one ever knows what'll happen to them .
except me , now .
i know .
are you scared?
sure am .
i don't want to stop living .
i loved life so much .
what was it you loved?
everything .
wine , books , music , women , above all women .
their smell , their mouths , the feel of their skin .
were there many of them?
yes .
don't they begin to seem the same?
a bit , yes .
but i never get tired of them .
still the great seducer?
no , not anymore .
with age , it's not the same thing .
do you still enjoy wine?
unfortunately not .
not with my liver .
the trips you dreamed of , did you make them?
nowadays there are tourists everywhere .
it's not the present you cling on , it's your past life .
that life is already dead .
perhaps .
i expected a musty antique dealer , not a ravishing young lady .
i warn you , i'm no specialist .
at one time everyone here was catholic .
like in spain or ireland .
at a very precise moment in 1966 , in fact the churches suddenly emptied out , in a few months .
a very strange phenomenon that has yet to be explained .
so now we don't know what to do with this .
the authorities would like to find out if it has any value .
commercial value?
yes .
do you have any 18th centuary french cahlices?
the americans snapped them up .
there are a few examples in the museums .
i'm sure this has great value for people here , the collective memory .
but is there anything that we could sell?
on the world market?
honestly , i can't imagine it .
in other words , this is all absolutely worthless .
i'll show you out .
pius xii sitting on his ass in his gilded vatican while primo levi was taken to auschwitz ...
that's not sad !
it's despicable !
hideous !
if what you say true , and history is a series of abominable crimes , then someone has to exist who can forgive us .
that's my belief .
i envy you .
if at least i'd written .
you wrote nothing?
a few papers here and there , nothing serious .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
it bugs me .
what would you have written?
the gulag archipelago , the periodic table .
really , in that class?
never .
so?
at least i'd have left a mark .
we need to succeed , even on our own terms .
to be a able to say we did our best .
it allows us to die at peace .
i'm a total failure .
at least you realize it .
so many professors are smug , unbearable .
i don't know your daughter , but sebastien's not exactly a failure .
not thanks to me .
you don't know that .
we thought we'd pay a visit .
everyone wonders how you are .
not everyone , surely .
you'd be surprised .
that last day in class no one seemed very moved .
we had no idea at the time .
exactly .
now that you're gone ...
we see what we're missing .
i'm touched to hear that .
sincerely .
we should be going .
we have a lecture by mr roby at 4 .
off you go .

it's not their fault .
no one taught them .
at this price we'll come anytime .
we'll see .
i don't want it .
we agreed .
no , thanks .
do you want to split hers?
we're getting married next summer , at my parents 'in france .
you'll see , the chapel's lovely .
louise and i married on a grey february day in a dismal suburb .
so we could sleep together without our families hassling us .
i want a wedding on the loire .
6 months later i cheated on her .
that was fast .
indeed .
with him it's forever , there'll be no one else .
i hope it lasts , for your sake .
because , you know , love ...
no , no , no !
not " love .
mom and dad talked like that .
love .
i love you .
i love you too much .
i don't love you .
you can't build a life on pop song philosophy .
love me tender .
love , love me not .
it's ridiculous .
my parents divorced when i was 3 .
for several years dad continued to come over for sunday lunch .
half an hour before he left , i'd vanish .
i'd be lying on the ground in front of his car so he couldn't leave .
my kids won't go through that .
so now my nocturnal pleasures are provided by my giant screen toshiba at the foot of my bed .
no more curled up toes?
that's over .
i've seen enough ceilings .
ei .
olen katsellut kattoa for ever?
i've closed the store , laid down my arms , hung up my skates .
things are much quieter between us too .
well , well .
he's in bologna all week and i'm in rome .
there's the weekend , but ...
my wife falls asleep in bed with the kids .
great , you can reread tocqueville .
that's what i did .
2000 pages on bible paper .
he's increasingly cultivated , and his prostate increasingly swollen .
sorry , i still enjoy it a lot .
in the country there's an old cowboy i ...
cowboy?
you're with a cowboy now?
yes .
there's an old cowboy i invite over to shake my bush .
to shae your bush !
yes , but we had a fight .
i'll never understand men .
all my life i date cads who thought only of escaping after satisfying their base needs .
to think we can still have sexual flings at our age .
he was incensed .
he doesn't want to be a sex object , talks about his masculinity .
we love that !
invokes father hunger goes on about exploring his feminine side , his inner me .
it was unbearable .
the last thing i want is a limp dicked sentimentalist .
i want to be screwed forcefully .
that's all .
i'm sensitive and smart enough for two .
a rub down?
would he like a rub down?
does the muslim need to bow towards mecca?
does the carmelite long for the holy species?
is this your first time here?
yes ...
i don't know if you believe in random acts of kindness , but if you do , render this sick man happy .
give him the mother of all rub downs .
you will be repaid a hundredfold in this life or another .
am i in heaven already?
are you my valkyrie , my houri?
oh joy !
nathalie didn't show .
it's bad .
your father's in withdrawal .
know where nathalie is?
no idea .
she's disappeared .
i warned you .
i may come back .
before 11 .
i'm not supposed to do this .
you were right .
you said not to trust you .
your dealer said that too .
wake up .
we've a contract .

i buy the dope , you look after dad .
what's with him?
he's waiting .
we're coming .

that's heavy , man .
we had a deal .
i'm counting on you .
at the market ... my dad ...
y'know , my dad ...

me , i made my life .
perfect young man .
perfect career .
perfect fiancee .
i'm imperfect .
it's sad .
it's very sad .
where have you been?
i didn't know what to do .
get a spoon .
what?
a spoon .
fill it to thirty .
i can't manage .
what is this?
don't ask , we don't have time .
you have to help .
i beg you .
give him this .
he needs it .
please , i'll explain later .
what's in it?
heroin .
i beg you .
shut the door , at least .
i'm going .
just this once .
it'll soon be over .
better?
we sat on your pier .
he was never happier than at the lake .
so could we borrow the cottage?
of course , i'll get the key .
what is it?
the keys to the cottage .
what for?
i'm letting sebastien use it .
he wants to take remy .
without asking me?
i'm truly sorry .
i'm the one who decorated it .
that's true .
the hours at ikea , don't they count .
or the curtains i sewed?
you lend our house to strangers without asking !
remy's not a stranger .
that's why nicole divorced tom cruise !
he'd lend their colorado home to anybody .
i'm lending my house to my friend reamy , and you shut up .
if that's how it is , i won't stay another second .
i'm taking the girls and moving out .
i'm sorry .
forget it , we'll manage .
no way .
use it whenever you like .
don't worry .
it's always this way .
that's life .
thanks .
no news from sylvaine?
no , i even called the boat's owned in chile .
i hope she's ok .
she is , it's just the net uplink .
the pacific's big .
goodbye .
embrace the mystery and you'll be saved .
say you love him .
tell him , and touch him .
drink this one .
right now?
here .
methadone's serious .
now i trust you .
drink one a day .
only one .
no more , no less .
come back on monday .
if you screw up , you're out of the program .
i still can't come to terms with it .
you know you have to .
i can't accept it .
that's how it is .
it's a law .
the very instant you shut your eyes , millions more will also die .
but i won't be here anymore .
me .
i'll be gone for good .
if at least i'd learned something .
i feel as helpless as the day i was born .
i haven't found a meaning .
it's
i have to search .
i have to keep searching .
we've been everything .
separatists , independantists , sovereignists , sovereignty associationists .
at first we were existentialists .
we read sartre and camus .
then fanon , we became anti colonialists .
we read marcuse and became marxists .
marxist leninists .
trotskyists .
maoists .
after solzhenitsyn we changed .
we were structuralists .
situationists .
feminists .
demonstructionists .
is there an " ism " we haven't worshipped .
cretinism .
god no .
think of guo jing .
who was he?
an archeologist with a skirt slit to the crotch .
even you remember .
in the 70s , china opens up to the west .
she comes on a cultural exchange .
the university sends its trusty radical , me ...
i enter the dining room of her hotel .
i spot her , and die .
beauty that could melt emperor qin's 7000 terra cotta warriors .
i order tea , we make small talk .
i can see us doing pekinese lotus .
the szechuan dragon .
to make myself appear intresting ,
your country has achieved so much .
we're so envious .
your cultural revolution is wonderful !
her lovely black eyes glaze over .
i'm mortified to realize that she's thinking ,
he's either a cla agent or the worst cretin in the west .
so much for the lotus and dragon .
for two years she'd cleaned pigsties on a re education farm .
father murdered , mother committed suicide .
and some dumb french canadian who's seen the films of jean luc godard and read philippe sollers says that the chinese cultural revolution , is wonderful !
cretinism doesn t sink any lower .
voluntary simplicity .
scrambled eggs with ossetra caviar and fresh truffles .
from tuscany .
and to stay in italy , castello banfi excelsus , a modest vintage .
why were we so dumb?
are we to infer congenital stupidity?
not at all .
intelligence isn't an individual trait .
it's collective , national , intermittent .
oh , a new theory !
athens , 416bc euripides premieres his electra
two rivals attend , sophocles and aristophanes .
and two friends , socrates and plato .
intelligence was there .
leonardo da vinci and michelangelo .
rafaello .
niccolo machiavelli .
philadelphia , usa , 1776 1787 .
declaration of independence and the constitution .
adams , franklin , jefferson , washington , hamilton and madison .
no other country has been so blessed .
i was born in chicoutimi , canada , in 1950 .
it's a miracle you're not dumber . in 1950 , everyone was dumb , in athens and chicoutimi .
in italy you'd have supported the red brigades .
now it's berlusconi .
philadelphia voted george bush .
you see , you're not that dumb .
intelligence has disappeared , and it can take eons to come back .
from tacitus to dante was what , 11 centuries?
the arabs kept intelligence alive .
true .
you're not hungry?
it won't go down .
and you?
no thanks .
i never thought i'd see the day you'd turn down fresh truffles .
alas , that day is here .
a sip of wine?
drink to my health and tell me how good it is .
i'd like to bow out just like felix faure .
why am i not surprised?
i can dream .
who was he?
why?
oh blessed felix faure , the president of the french republic .
his heart stopped beating , while his mistress the admirable madame steinheil , kneeling before him , bestowed on him the most glorious blowjob of all time .
my god !
she seized him , the would be caesar and he had a seizure !
henceforth madame steinheil was known as the kiss of death .
i should be so lucky !
it's not our fault if your heart is unstoppable .
i'd like to remind you that at a certain time , i and several others here blew you most heartily , with enough force to capsize a schooner .
what do you know about blowing buoys?
well , sir , our efforts earned gushing praise .
heavens , that's hard to swallow .
i'm beat .
go to bed .
aren't you coming?
not tonight .
the middle ages , the manuscripts ...
the barbarians , everywhere , tomorrow ...
their prince approaches .
are you trying to be funny?
i'm scared .
we'll do what you want .
it's your decision .
know what i want for you?
to have as fine a son as you .
heard from sylvaine?
no .
tell her i thought of her .
i love you .
not so long ago i'd have jumped you without asking .
i might have let you .
i suspected as much .
i wasn't here today .
you didn't see me .
of course .
this just came in .
on a ship , you call it the evil eye ...
striking a growler an iceberg at night , or a fire from an oil leak ...
it's been too long since i've seen you .
my daddy , my papuschka ,
i've have missed you all my life .
tell yourself i'm a happy woman , i've found my place .
i don't know how you did it , but you managed to pass on your lust for life
you and mom raised incredibly strong children .
it's a miracle really
you know , the first man in a woman's life is her father .
you'll always be with me .
friends , sharing this modest life with you has been a delight .
i take your smiles with me .
remy , remy ...
the man of my life .
my guardian angel .
it's a privilege to know you .
the privilege was all mine , miss .
mom doesn't want to live here .
i don't need to sell it .
you can move in for now .
if thls be a man
hlstorla and utopla
i love you .
