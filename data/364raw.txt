boxers !
not one step further .
the keeper of the lmperial seal .
just the man i was looking for .
a woman .
you chinese are very progressive .
a gift from an old friend .
wu chow .
he wanted me to send his regards .
father !
father .
the seal .
you must get it back .
i promise .
give this ... to your brother .
what are you reading?
oh .
roy o'bannon vs. the mummy .
it's incredible .
roy's just taken out the mummy's entire army of zombie confederate soldiers , and he only had one bullet .
that's impossible .
oh , no , it's not .
roy figured out the physics of the canyon and then ricocheted a bullet off the canyon wall .
nailed each zombie through the heart .
what about the shanghai kid?
he was captured and knocked out on page 10 while he was polishing roy's pearl handles .
don't you worry .
roy's about to save him from becoming a human sacrifice .
those stories are all lies .
no .
see?
it says right here on the back .
author sage mccallister bases all his stories on firsthand accounts .
sorry , sheriff .
no princess .
every day you meet the noon stage .
every day it's the same story .
she's not coming back .
pei pei's married to her work in san francisco .
modern woman .
sheriff , you got a parcel .
hey , maybe it's from her !
no .
it's from my sister in china .
i know .
i know .
i must go .
stay here and be a good horsey for the new sheriff .
uh , sheriff , that stage is headed east .
lsn't china kind of west of here?
i'm not going to china .
i'm going to new york .
roy invested my money .
ls it true that he lives in a penthouse at the top of the ritz surrounded by dozens of beautiful women at his every beck and call?
that's the old roy .
he's married , settled down .
trust me , he's changed .
so there we were .
completely outnumbered .
he didn't have to tell me we didn't stand a chance .
so i send the shanghai kid and the princess out the back .
poor shanghai kid .
he was so frightened .
he forgot to thank me for saving his life .
i'm used to that .
now , i returned to the front , and i counted to three ... and i burst out of the mission .
pearl handles blazing .
lead flying everywhere .
and not a single bullet touched me .
no !
yeah .
what happened to the emperor's gold?
well , we divided it up .
i insisted on giving my share to the lndians .
the savages?
please don't ever call those noble people savages .
lf being proud of your body and wanting to ride around naked all day makes you a savage , then , by god , you're drinking with a savage .
and that is what you call a french toast .
you are so sophisticated , mr. o'bannon .
whoo !
who's up for some more bubbly?
reach for the sky , roy .
say that again .
reach for the sky , roy .
chon wang !
you sly son of a gun !
look at you !
look at you !
what brings you to new york?
my share of the gold .
refresh my memory .
what gold?
the emperor's gold .
okay , now , that gold is in what the wall street pros call a long term investment .
we can't touch it because it's building .
i need it tonight .
you just got here .
let's celebrate .
no .
i don't have time .
you just got to the big city .
my father's been killed .
chon , i'm ...
you need the money to get back for the funeral?
no .
i must go to england .
the ship leaves tonight .
your father died in england?
china .
my sister followed the murderer to london .
wait .
murderer .
i'm a little bit mixed up .
let me see if i can get the facts straight .
you have a sister?
you never told me you had a sister .
ls she pretty or does she look like you?
be honest .
roy , i need my money !
i don't like that tone of voice .
you think after all we've been through i'd stiff you?
i'm doing pretty well for myself .
yeah .
i'm sorry , roy .
that's okay .
you're going through a really tough time right now .
you got to be more trusting of people , okay?
look at me .
it's roy .
the couple at table 5 is ready to order .
do you work here?
no , i don't work here .
it looks like these guys are wearing a similar jacket .
roy , here's your cut of the tips .
it's the craziest thing .
i guess because i come in here so much they're mistaking me for a waiter .
it's embarrassing .
you lost the gold .
not all of it .
where's the rest?
i have one word for you .
zeppelin .
i need my money now !
easy , easy .
will you do anything for this money?
yes .
i must leave tonight .
okay .
take this key .
go to the room .
get cleaned up .
your old pal roy's got a plan .
go !
come on !
howdy , big boy .
what?
there's a woman in there !
she wants me to sleep with her .
of course she does .
i told her the great wall ain't the only big thing coming out of china .
why did you say that?
so you could get the money .
i will not sleep with women for money !
why?
i'm gonna sleep with her for money .
chon , just go in there and do your business and think about your sister in england .
what?
roy !
duty calls .
roy !
good evening , mr. mayor .
where are they?
who?
my daughters .
10th floor .
roy?
roy , you got trouble .
roy !
i got to check on something .
i'll be right back .
chon , new plan .
we got to go .
chon , what are you doing? !
i'm fixing her back .
put her down , you decadent philistine .
hey , chon , come on !
let's go !
bye bye .
bye .
come on !
i don't understand .
what's going on?
i don't have time to explain .
all you have to know is there are bad men after us ... but i'm in the right .
roy .
you gotta trust me on this .
okay , look .
i'm in a transitional phase in my life .
but ...
but what?
you want to know the truth?
i'm a little lost right now .
i see you .
you've got a sense of purpose .
but look at me .
i'm a 30 year old waiter/ gigolo .
where's the future in that?
so what's the plan?
you were always my compass , chon .
the plan .
you ask me the right questions .
the plan?
the plan , i think , is to find the right woman .
raise a lot of children and teach them values .
no , roy .
the plan to get out of here .
okay , the plan .
here we go .
cops !
cops !
they can help us .
no , no .
chon , not these cops .
these are dirty cops .
they take advantage of people .
now , if they stop us , remember , i'm not roy o'bannon .
who are you?
i'm your friend smoky desperado from the west .
and who am l?
you .
you're benihana .
benihana .
yeah .
you teach crippled children yoga here in the city .
you go first .
no !
why me?
because you blend in , okay?
now , go !
don't let them see you !
benihana .
hey !
hey !
ooh .
psst !
chon !
come on .
stop wasting time .
you !
chon , i found our ticket out of here .
we're on our way .
looks like old roy came through again .
just like old times , chon .
check over there !
over to the alley !
that way !
yeah , just like old times .
will you forget about the gold for a second?
you're gonna have more money than you ever dreamed of when that first zeppelin takes off .
why do i always believe you?
what do you mean?
you're lucky i didn't invest in that ridiculous automobile idea .
yeah , that's gonna make a lot of money .
what's that?
doghouse .
i'm in the doghouse .
oh , come on , chon .
look , i'm sorry i lied .
i just didn't want to disappoint you .
that's exactly what i mean .
i can't take that look .
i learned it from my father .
that's how he used to look at me .
what did your dad do?
was he an lmperial guard?
no .
much more important .
he was the keeper of the lmperial seal .
that's what i love about china .
everybody's job description sounds so damn cool .
the seal has been symbol of the emperor's power since genghis khan .
it has been passed down from one emperor to another .
my family have been watching over it for 12 generations .
12 generations?
my father and i used to skip stones across the moat and talk about a day i would follow his footsteps .
i was his only son .
lf i'd have been there , i could have protected him .
it's not your fault .
you were 3, 000 miles away .
what's with that little box?
my sister sent it to me from my father .
there's a message inside .
what's it say?
it's a puzzle box .
i don't know how to open yet .
what do you mean?
get a hammer and smash it open so you can see what it says .
i must have patience .
by the time i'm able to open it ...
i will be ready to read the message .
come on , confucius .
that's the corniest thing i've ever heard .
let me see this .
you know what?
we're gonna go to england .
we're gonna find your dad's killer .
we're gonna get that seal back .
there's no reward for this , roy .
who said anything about a reward?
i'm talking about friendship , loyalty , honor .
okay?
thank you , roy .
and i hear england is ass soup .
a lot of pretty girls there .
first order of business , my lords ... is a report from our esteemed friend lord rathbone ... who recently returned from a diplomatic mission to china .
fellow lords ...
i'm afraid i bring disturbing news from the orient .
the opium wars have ravaged the land .
the emperor's enemies are organizing .
the most vicious are the boxers .
a godless band of rebels who murder without discretion .
china is not well .
i have brought back an envoy who should give us some insight into the inscrutable mind of the chinese .
ls he mad?
given to her majesty queen victoria by the emperor in recognition of her 50 glorious years on the throne .
outrageousness !
long live the queen .
# england swings like a pendulum do #
# bobbies on bicycles , two by two #
# westminster abbey , the tower of big ben #
# the rosy red cheeks of the little children #
jack the ripper strikes again !
extra !
extra !
read all about it .
howdy , partner .
the english are not very friendly .
they're just sore losers .
what did they lose?
a little thing called the american revolution , chon .
never heard of it .
i'll give you the highlights .
they came over with about a million men .
we had a bunch of farmers with pitchforks and beat 'em like a drum .
hey !
i'm walking here !
you're driving on the wrong side of the road !
bunch of amateurs .
these people don't get it .
hello , ladies .
look at you .
what?
i'm not supposed to notice a pretty lady?
i thought you wanted to settle down and have a family .
i do , chon .
i just hope i can .
why not?
sometimes i worry that all the damn horseback riding
i did out in the west , bouncing up and down on the hard saddles might have made it so my salmon don't swim upstream the way they're supposed to .
what?
i might be shooting blanks .
oh .
don't say anything .
roy , it's okay .
some people are not meant to have a family .
i've always had such a special connection with children .
the little ankle biters .
hey , watch it , you little punk !
pardon me , guv .
you gents lost your way?
yeah .
we're looking for my sister .
she's staying at 32 oxford street .
i know it well , guv .
me old man used to live there .
can you show us the way?
well , memory's a little dodgy .
but i'm sure for a bob i could get you there .
what do you take us for?
okies from muskogee?
go sell your bullshit someplace else .
we're not buying .
thanks for the tip , guv .
hey !
i stole that watch from my uncle !
what?
this way .
come here , you little rubbish eater !
what did i tell you about poaching on our turf , charlie?
i'm on the straight and narrow .
honest .
what's this , then?
after i'm through beating you ... you're gonna wish you never ran away from the workhouse !
leave the boy alone .
bloody tourists !
get your noses out of it !
do whatever you want to the kid ... but that's my watch .
well , there's a load of us and only two of you .
so piss off !
easy , fellas .
you've lost one war this way .
don't make the same mistake twice .
come on !
after him !
hey !
there he is !
get him !
we've got him now .
move in , lads .
boys , boys , wait , wait !
come on !
get him !
up the bloody ladder !
hey !
hey !
oh !
watch it !
hey .
ah !
come here , you !
cool .
move it !
you !
did you see that?
it's okay .
okay? !
i call that one my kung pao chicken .
i clotheslined the sucker .
come on , get back !
clear away !
make way !
i think you gentlemen should accompany me back to the yard .
this isn't a yard !
it's a jail !
roy , calm down .
unbelievable .
wait !
someone's coming !
let me handle this .
i'm gonna handle it .
the english aren't like you .
they don't get all emotional .
touchy feely .
do me a favor .
park the kung fu .
let me do the talking .
come here .
let me give you a hug .
ooh !
i've been after that fleet street gang for two years .
then you two come along and bring them down in a single afternoon .
brilliant !
now , um ...
oh , that's my watch !
yes .
a street urchin turned it in .
the little punk better not have scuffed it .
i hope your luck picks up .
what do you mean?
i deduced from your watch that you'd hit a rough patch .
he has .
how do you know?
it's an investigative technique i've developed .
i can deduce intimate details about an individual through a close scrutiny of their personal effects .
what else can you tell?
the owner of this watch is a bad gambler and a lousy shot .
although he's cheated death several times ... he spends most of his life wandering in a rather pathetic and futile search for purpose and respect .
oh , yes .
he has a penchant for loose women .
wow .
that's amazing .
i'm sure it's a very popular party trick at birthdays for small children ... but it doesn't quite play with adults .
just to set the record straight .
roy o'bannon is not attracted to loose women .
loose women are attracted to me .
you're roy o'bannon?
yeah .
the famous western folk hero?
have you heard of me?
have i heard of you?
i've only read " roy o'bannon vs. the mummy " five times .
it's fascinating .
i want you to meet the shanghai kid .
oh , yes .
the faithful chinese sidekick .
i'm not a sidekick .
those stories are all lies .
come on , don't be bitter .
i can't help what sage mccallister writes .
lf there's anything i can do , i'm at your service .
we're looking for my sister .
she's staying at this address .
can you take us there?
oh , dear .
i think you'd better come with me .
lin .
wang .
lf you don't mind , i'll just wait outside .
lntroduce me .
oh .
this is lin , my baby sister .
roy o'bannon .
pleasure .
you never told me your sister was such a ... beautiful lotus blossom .
what'd she say?
no , no , no .
no talking about me in your native tongue .
why are you in jail?
i followed the man who murdered father .
and?
i found out where he live .
i snuck inside his house and tried to kill him .
it's my duty to find father's killer .
no , it is mine !
i'm the one who promised father .
but i'm his only son .
when you abandoned us for america ...
father said he had no son .
what?
whoa .
time out .
time out .
come here .
the detective's a fan .
why don't i play the celebrity card?
we'll get her out that way .
okay?
okay .
don't worry .
i'll get you out .
everything's gonna be okay .
ln fact , i'm gonna give you my good luck playing cards .
just ignore the naked ladies .
wang !
have you opened father's box?
not yet .
she tried to assassinate lord rathbone whilst he was taking afternoon tea .
he's 10th in line to the throne ...
her majesty's favorite cousin ... and the finest swordsman in england .
so , of course , the press had a field day .
the story actually knocked jack the ripper off the front page .
artie , lin is not a killer .
she's just a really , really , really hot ... confused chinese girl .
maybe if i agreed to sign a few autographs and talk to some of my fans here in england ... do some type of charity event , can we get her out that way?
i'm afraid that's out of the question .
what will happen to my sister?
she'll go to trial , probably be locked away in an institution for the criminally insane .
the tabloids have already dubbed her " loony lin .
i thought it was rather catchy .
at the time .
do you have any notion what would happen if we were to be seen together?
since your return , i have yet to lay eyes on the lmperial seal .
i'm hosting a jubilee ball at my country estate tomorrow .
be at the stables at midnight .
as requested , a token of my esteem .
this is where you get out .
i hope there will be more trust between us when i'm emperor and you are the new king .
wow .
buckingham palace .
look at that , chon .
that's where the queen lives .
hey , look at this guy .
he's a royal guard .
he has a very important job .
i used to be just like him .
no , they're nothing like you .
they're a tourist attraction .
you can make faces at them , insult them ... and they can't move a muscle .
here .
watch this .
roy ...
no , it's okay .
hey , buddy , your shoes are untied .
that is the biggest damn beaver i have ever seen .
roy , stop it .
the queen !
look !
the queen !
she's mooning us !
he almost went for that .
my friend and i just came over from america .
you might have heard of it .
we run your jerkwater country .
come on , you gonna take that from a colonial?
roy , stop it .
i bet you are one hell of a damn poker player .
no hard feelings .
huh?
they can't do that !
you're not allowed to do that !
shouldn't have touched him .
you scram , you little punk .
i've got friends at scotland yard .
i'll give you up in a heartbeat .
you get your watch back?
don't worry about my watch .
go on .
it's a knockoff .
what are you talking about?
my uncle stole this watch from president lincoln .
it's a priceless family heirloom .
not according to the pawnbroker .
you should not steal .
lf i don't steal , i don't eat .
who showed you how to do all that kicking and punching?
my father .
have you ever heard of those?
they're parents .
you don't 'cause you're a little orphan .
now , go on .
you're cramping our style .
oh , this country blows .
you need a place to stay?
come on in and warm your dogs .
you can get into a lot of trouble breaking into a place like this .
that being said , well done .
you just ate the last chocolate .
course i did .
you gotta look out for number one .
i could really get used to this .
living the life of a country gentleman .
maybe doing a little painting .
let lin play in the garden with the children .
vera , chuck , and dave .
who's lin?
lin's the most beautiful woman i've ever met .
she's gonna be the savior of the house of o'bannon .
chon , check out the threads .
all i'm missing is the loyal hound curled at my feet .
we are wasting time .
we must find rathbone .
what do you think i've been doing?
sitting here drinking expensive hooch?
refill .
i've been working on a plan .
now whoa .
don't slosh the brandy .
it messes with the bouquet .
sod off .
i'm trying to teach you a skill set .
help get you off the street .
bartenders make big bucks .
roy !
the plan .
thank you , chon .
lf we find the seal ... we can prove rathbone killed your dad .
it's the old hail mary play .
i also have a version where we dig a tunnel .
hey !
bloody catapult .
jesus christ !
you don't need a catapult !
who asked you?
you don't interrupt grown ups when they're talking .
lord nelson rathbone requests the pleasure of your company at the jubilee ball in honor of her majesty's 50th year on the throne .
sounds good .
it doesn't address security .
they're not gonna let chon and i waltz into the castle .
all you need is a proper disguise .
i do like a good disguise .
i look like a fool .
what? !
you're a maharaja .
that's lndian royalty .
but i'm chinese .
it's the same thing .
bob your head a little bit .
gives you more of a lndia royalty flavor .
that's good .
good show , good show .
good show , good show .
cheerio , cheerio .
cheerio , cheerio .
what do we do when we see rathbone?
kill him .
no , okay?
no !
you're gonna be civil , 'cause we don't have the seal .
no seal .
no lin .
no family honor .
okay?
be cool .
okay , we look great .
let's enjoy this party .
whoa .
what are you doing?
i'm going inside .
the place is haunted .
you're the harness man .
you get back at the carriage .
you wait in case we need to make a quick getaway .
go on .
man your post .
you don't always get what you want .
why are you so mean to that boy?
i see a lot of myself in that kid .
it's kind of freaking me out .
come on .
your name , please , sir .
so i can announce you .
sherlock ... holmes .
sherlock holmes .
which province do you represent , your highness?
nevada .
may i present major general sherlock holmes and his highness , the maharaja of nevada .
how are the security arrangements?
oh , everything seems to be going swimmingly , my lord .
and if i may say so ... it is an honor to guard your lordship tonight .
i speak for all of us at scotland yard when i say that no matter how far you are from the throne ... you'll always be number one in our hearts .
okay , here's the plan .
we're gonna get a little chow .
then we're gonna sneak out of here .
start looking for that seal .
okay .
spotted dick , sir?
what?
spotted dick .
can you believe this guy?
i'm trying to get something to eat .
he's asking me if i got the clap .
i think he's offering you food .
oh .
spotted dick .
oh , no .
i think i'll pass .
i'm not really a dessert man .
perhaps my friend might like some spotted dick .
i might try one of these sausages .
a little smoky joe .
mmm !
this is good !
i thought the food here was supposed to suck .
the haggis is fresh from scotland , sir .
it's made from the finest sheeps 'bladders .
i'm gonna get some whiskey and wash my mouth out .
you should try the quail .
i shot them myself this morning .
how do you do , your lordship?
very well , thank you .
i'm not acquainted with the nevada province .
but i haven't been to lndia since '81 .
i spent most of my time in the orient .
i hear you've just returned from china .
you are well informed , maharaja .
it is my dream that the chinese people will follow lndia's example and one day embrace british rule .
the chinese are very proud .
they place family and honor above all else .
well , i'm sure we can break them of that .
lf you'll excuse me , i have a matter to attend to .
until we meet again .
patience .
i'm proud of you , chon .
we must find the seal .
what do you see?
shh , shh , shh !
he just pulled a fancy dragon key out of his desk .
that was my father's !
i must avenge his honor .
hey , slow down , tiger .
slow down .
quit going all chinese on me .
where is he?
damn it .
remember your puzzle box .
patience .
okay , there are no windows .
we just came in through the only doorway .
that leaves one explanation .
remember in " roy o'bannon vs. the mummy " how the zombie king got away when i chased him into the pharaoh's tomb?
there's a secret passageway behind the sphinx .
there's gotta be a lever or a button over here .
help me lift some stuff up .
roy !
the painting .
it's looking at me .
look !
oh , yeah .
looks like it's looking at me .
that's great .
no , real eyes .
moving !
that kid got to you , didn't he?
unbelievable !
we're not in a haunted house .
that's a technique that an artist uses .
ubiquitous gaze " or " pursuant eyes " is the technical term .
it's unnerving , though .
i'll give you that .
roy .
now , those eyes .
look !
whatever you say , chon .
let's see what you got here , rathbone .
roy !
what , chon?
are the statues moving now?
wow .
mm mmm !
roy !
i can't hear myself think with you shouting at me .
chon?
chon?
chon?
this is ridiculous .
lf you want to act like a child and play games ... then find someone else ...
'cause i take this stuff seriously .
i'm here to work .
i'm on a mission .
chon?
okay , chon .
okay , you little chinese otter .
let's play .
ha !
chon , demons !
she's gonna fight my battles for me .
come on .
let's go .
what?
what are you doing?
it's kinky .
i like it .
wow !
look at this .
wait .
there's something different about this room .
hey .
