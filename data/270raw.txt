do you got a death wish , galloway?
no , sir .
well , then why are you here?
'cause i knew these dead boys would be here , sir .
why aren't you a soldier?
you got the guts for it .
my daddy was a soldier .
my granddaddy , two of my great granddaddies was soldiers .
hell , tha\ x9ds how i came to be .
each of them lost a leg in the civil war .
my great granddaddy galloway , he lost his left ... and my great granddaddy reid lost his right .
they met in a shoe store in galveston .
every year after that , same date , same store , they'd get together ... and pick out a new pair of shoes for the two of them .
you are shittin 'me .
no , sir .
i swear to god .
anyway , one had a daughter , one had a son ... my grandparents .
what do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was?
i don't know , colonel .
it was meant to be , i guess .
yeah .
meant to be .
sir , galloways have been in every war this country's ever fought .
but when it came to this one , i didn't think i could stop the war .
i just thought maybe i might try and understand one .
maybe help folks back home understand .
i just figure i could do that better ... shooting a camera than i could shooting a rifle .
well ...
i sure hope you make it through this one .
you too , colonel .

le\ x9ds go !
captain , have your men dig some firing steps .
throw some dirt on those bodies , keep the smell down .
roger , sergeant major .
kind of makes you wish you'd signed up for submarines , don't it?
brigade headquarters wants you out on the first chopper at dawn .
what idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle?
gen. westmoreland wants a briefing .
give me the horn .
i am in a fight ... and i object to this order to return to saigon .
now , i will not leave my men .
is that clear?
out .
there's two of my men unaccounted for out there ... and i\ x9ds where the worst of the fighting was ... so they'll be out there someplace .
le\ x9ds go out and get 'em .
i'm with you , sir .
all right .
le\ x9ds go .
they ... brought another ...
oh , god .
julie , i\ x9ds yours .
he died keeping my promise .
sir , they're ordering us all out .
all of us .
they're gonna march reinforcements in .
they don't understand a damn thing , do they?
can't get out .
he's waiting up there in a cave , and tha\ x9ds what he wants .
the minute he sees live soldiers hopping on a helicopter ... he'll be all over us and then he'll get what he wants .
he'll get his massacre .
requesting permission to rejoin the lines , sir .
all right , son .
garry owen , sir .
i wonder what was going through custer's mind when he realized ... he'd led his men into a slaughter .
sir , custer was a pussy .
you ain't .
goddamn .
hell .
right now they're planning their final attack ... the one that will finish us off .
they'll nibble at us all night , then ... come dawn they'll hit us with everything they got .
tha\ x9ds what i'd do if i was him .
sergeant major , hand out the last of the ammunition .
yes , sir .
fix bayonets .
you were wondering how custer felt , sir .
you ought to ask him .
sergeant savage !
checking the dead enemies for documents ... and i found this on the guy that tried to bayonet you .
translated some of it , mostly personal .
thought you might wanna have a look at it .
what was that?
i\ x9ds american artillery .
friendly fire .
how many casualties?
what the hell happened here , joe?
hey , joe .
colonel moore !
colonel !
colonel moore !
what is the key to your victory?
sir , tell us how you feel .
do you feel the states will be forced ... to take the north vietnamese more seriously?
how do you feel about the loss ofyour men , sir?
have you notified the families , sir?
i'm glad you made it , son .
thankyou , sir .
you too .
i'll never forgive myself .
for what , sir?
that my men ...
that my men died and i didn't .
sir , i don't ...
i don't know how to tell this story .
well , you got to , joe .
you tell the american people what these men did here .
you tell 'em how my troopers died .
yes , sir .
thank you .
all of our men , living and dead , are off the field , sir .
well done , sergeant major .
in saigon , hal moore's superiors congratulated him ... for killing over 1800 enemy soldiers .
then ordered him to lead the men of the 7th cavalry ... back into the valley of death .
he led them ... and fought beside them ... for 235 more days .
kids , go to bed .
isn't there someone at the door?
go to bed !
children , your daddy's home !
daddy !
some had families waiting .
for others , their only family would be the men they bled beside .
there were no bands , no flags ... no honor guards to welcome them home .
they went to war because their country ordered them to .
but in the end they fought not for their country or their flag .
they fought for each other ...
dear barbara ...
i have no words to express to you my sadness of the loss of jack .
the world is a lesser place without him .
but i know he is with god and the angels .
and even heaven is improved by his presence there .
i know you , too , are sure of this ... and yet this knowledge can't diminish his loss ... and your grief .
with abiding respect and affection , hal moore .
we who have seen war ... will never stop seeing it .
in the silence of the night , we will always hear the screams .
so this is our story ... for we were soldiers once ... and young .
