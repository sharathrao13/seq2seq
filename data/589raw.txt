boys , rosalita doesn't speak a word of english ... ... and i know some of you took spanish in school .
well , mrs. walsh , i speak perfect spanish .
if it's any help to you , i'd be glad to communicate with rosalita .
you're a lifesaver , clark .

mikey , no more potato chips .
hello , mikey .

pants and shirts are in the second .
just throw them all into boxes .
forget the suitcases .
can you translate that?
certainly , mrs. walsh .
that's wonderful .
look .
how's that?
you idiot !
you glued it on upside down !
if god meant it that way , you'd be pissing in your faces .
looks fine to me .
rosalita , this is the attic .
mr. walsh doesn't like anyone up here .
that's why it's always open .
this is my supply closet .
you'll find brooms , dustpans , insect spray .
i'd like the house clean when they tear it down .
clark , can you translate?

i'm taking rosalita to the supermarket .
i'll be back in about an hour .
mikey , stay inside .
brand , if he has asthma , i don't want him in the rain .
he should be in a plastic bubble .
i'm serious .
that's not funny .
he takes one step outside , and you are in absolutely the deepest ...

i don't like that language , but that's what you'll be in .

my dad's giving it back to the museum ... ... or the new assistant curly ...
curney ...
curator .
wait , guys .
maybe there's stuff up there for us that we can keep from the oldsiders .
maybe there's some rich stuff !
no !
it's my dad's responsibility , you guys .
the museum's probably got a list .
listen to me !
that's his stuff !
look at this .
i didn't know dad had all this stuff up here .
great !
look at that !
neat !
i love it .
come on , guys !
my dad doesn't want you up here .
you heard what my mom said about not wanting anybody up here .
i cannot believe you actually have something this cool in your house .
you guys , my mom said ...
guys , stop .
put down the outfit , okay?
this is great .
we only have hanukkah decorations in our attic .
i don't care what you have in your ...
okay , you saw it , now let's go .
come on , mikey .
it's cool !
i got you right where i want you !

mikey !
come here and make me feel like a woman .
come on , give me a nice , wet , lickery kiss .
i gotcha !
get out from there , you're ruining the painting !
you're ruining my joke .
the painting's already cracked .
hey , mikey?
what?
what is all this stuff?
the museum did some ...
where'd you get this?
right there .
they did a show .
a retropactum .
retrospective .
i said that .
don't contradict me .
it was about the history of astoria , and these are the rejects .
kind of like us , the goonies .
i'm not a reject .
take that off .
you'll get me in trouble .
you know how this works?
what?
laser beams !
mouth , when you drop something , put it back up ...
what's this?
wait a second .
chunk !
i didn't touch it .
i know .
get over here .
hold this .
why me , mike?
thanks for taking us up here .
there's a real big ball ... ... and it's got this thing ...
what are you doing?
mike found a map .
and look .
that says " 1632 " .
is that a year?
no .
it's your top score on pole position .
yes , it's a year .
it's a map of our coastline .
what's all that spanish junk right there?
mouth , you said you can translate .
translate .
yeah , translate it .
ye intruders beware .
crushing death and grief ... ... soaked with blood of the trespassing thief " .
this map is old news .
everybody went looking for that when our parents were our age .
haven't you heard of him?
what's his name?
the pirate guy .
one eyed willy .
one eyed willy !
the most famous pirate in his time .
my dad told me all about him .
dad'll do anything to put you to sleep .
no !
see , one eyed willy stole a treasure once .
and it was full of rubies and emeralds ...
and diamonds?
and diamonds .
then he loaded it onto his ship ... ... and sailed away into the sunset .
until the british king found out about it ... ... and sent out his whole armada to go after him .
it took them a couple of weeks to catch up with willy .
then there was a whole big war ... ... between the armada and willy's ship , the inferno .
during the firefight , there were ... ... guns and cannons bursting here and there .
then willy fled , because he knew he'd get killed if he stayed around .
and then he got into this cave ... ... and the british blew up the walls around him .
he got caved in , and he's been there ever since .
forever?
forever .
and ever?
trapped .
you sound as corny as dad does .
my dad tells the truth .
know what he said?
he said one eyed willy and his bunch were down there for years .
they were digging tunnels and caves .
setting booty traps .
booby traps .
setting booby traps so anybody who tried to get in would die .
then he killed all his men .
why?
why kill all of them?
so they wouldn't get his treasure .
wait a minute .
if he killed all his men , how did the map get out?
my dad said one of the guys must have gotten out with the map .
hey , mikey , i believe you .
i don't believe you at all .
what did you break this time , chunk?
hey , you guys , look at this .
you ever hear of this guy?
chester copperpot .
look what it says .
chester copperpot , missing while in pursuit of local legend .
reclusive scavenger claims , " i have the key ... ... to one eyed willy " .
wow , do you guys realize what we could do?
nobody ever found nothing .
why would this map be in this attic ... ... when it could be in some safe deposit box , right?
right .
if chester copperpot didn't find it , how would we find it?
but what if?
you guys ... ... what if this map can lead to one eyed willy's rich stuff?
we wouldn't have to leave the goon docks .
come on , mike .
i don't want to go on any more of your goonie adventures .
where are you going?
you don't want to do this?
1632 .
jerk alert .
can i help you?
hello , little guys .
i'm mr. perkins , troy's father .
we know troy , he's a cheap guy .
my dad's not home , mr. perkins .
is your mommy here?
no , she's down at the market buying pampers for all us kids .
papers .
well , you can give these papers to your father to read through and sign .
we'll be by to pick them up in the morning .
thank you .
thank you .
what is that?
it's dad's business .
but what is it?
i told you it was dad's business .
look at them smiling .
they can't wait till tomorrow to foreclose on whatever it's called .
trash the goon docks .
i hope they make our house a sand trap .
and never get their balls out .
you know , i think they made me lose my appetite .
come on , before you catch a real cold .
you're sure of yourself .
the foreclosure is a definite .
oh , god , am i depressed .
if i found one eyed willy's rich stuff , i'd pay all my dad's bills .
then he could sleep at night ... ... instead of sitting up figuring how we can stay .
me too .
me three .
forget any adventures , limp lungs .
if i let you out , mom will ground me , and i've got a date with andy .
you're dreaming , dude .

brand , how far can you stretch that?
it's not that hard .
get off me , chunk .
get off me !

there's nothing to be scared of .
two customers went inside the place .
what if they're not customers?
what if they're drug dealers?
drug dealers?

drug dealers don't wear polyester rags .
mikey , mikey !
that sounded like gunshots .
not the kind you hear in movies , but real ones .
they're gonna kill us .
turn off your brain .
somebody dropped a pot .
yeah , a pot !

mouth , you stepped on my foot .
now i dropped my glasses .
i can't see a thing .
oh , my god .
i found your glasses .
sorry .
you broke them .
you broke my glasses !
listen , i'm the oldest , so i'm in charge .
first , we'll ...
data , do you have a light?
i said i was in charge .
data , do you have a light?
sure , guys .
back up , back up .
bully blinders !
all right , data ...
ow !
isn't that neat?
one day i was walking home with it , and two big guys stopped me ...
who is that?
oh , stef , that's you .
watch out .
data !
come on , turn it off .
oh , data .
the only problem is the batteries don't last so long .
there's a light up ahead .
maybe we can get out that way .
let's go .
i'm not afraid of the dark .
i like the dark .
i love it .
but i hate nature .
i hate nature !
wait a sec !
hold it !
stop !
i'm just a kid !
what seems to be the problem?
mister , i need a ride .
my friends and i had a run in with disgusting people .
you might've heard of them , the fratellis .
we found their hideout .
could you take me to the sheriff?
i can describe all three of them .
will you ...
what the hell?
he's only a kid .
can't you handle a kid , even?
does it work , guys?
yeah !
i can't see .
mouth , your father's a plumber .
what are these pipes?
these look like water pipes , guys .
gas pipes .
drainage .
maybe ...
wait a minute .
shut up for a minute !
these pipes must lead to a building or something .
a foundation .
so maybe if we bang on them hard enough , if we make enough noise ...
how are you , duke?
hey , gene , how are you?
great .
reverse pressure !
daddy !
let's ...
get out of ...
here !
like now !
go , go , go !
first , we start with the pudgy little fingers .
then the plump little hands .
then the fleshy arms .
now , tell me where your friends are .
in the fireplace .
don't lie to me !
honestly .
we found a map over at mikey's dad's place ... ... that said there was buried treasure under here .
don't give us none of your bullshit stories , huh?
spill your guts .
tell us everything .
everything?
everything .
okay , i'll talk .
in 3rd grade , i cheated on my history exam .
in 4th grade , i stole my uncle's toupee and glued it on my face ... ... when i played moses in my hebrew school play .
in 5th grade , i knocked my sister down the stairs , and i blamed our dog .
wait , i can't see a thing .
what am i stepping on?
oh , brother .
look , a lantern .
somebody must have been here before us .
maybe they're still here .
i hope not .
look at these cigarettes .
ten minutes ago , troy was looking down my shirt .
who cares?
it's not wrong .
if i'd been smart , he'd still be looking .
listen to her .
what's wrong with her?
andy , it's okay .
is she all right?
i should've let him look at my body .
don't i have a beautiful body?
you've got a great body .
how many years do i have before i get fat?
before my hair falls out?
before i look like him?
then my mom sent me to a summer camp for fat kids .
then , once during lunch , i got nuts and i pigged out ... ... and they kicked me out !
look at him .
don't touch it , guys .
this is one of your tricks , right , one eyed willy?
you must be really hiding something to go through all this trouble .
there's nothing to worry about .
you don't understand !
don't be afraid .
he's dead for sure .
i think he's chester copperpot .
chester who?
who?
don't you remember from the attic?
the news article?
the last guy to look for the rich stuff ... ... he went in , but he never came back out .
that was back in 1935 .
oh , god .
if he didn't make it out and he was an expert , what about us?
how will we get out?
don't worry about it .
calm down .
you sure?
i'm positive .
how will we get out?
we can't be sure it's him .
i know it's him .
i bet his i. d. is in his wallet .
mouth , get his wallet .
lou gehrig?
you get it , mikey !
mikey , get it .
it is chester copperpot .
oh , god .
come on .
you see?
i told you .
we're gonna get killed too .
hey , look at this .
candles .
they're gonna kill us .
we're dead .
where are you going?
i'm setting booty traps .
booby traps .
that's what i said .
i'll set booby traps in case anyone follows us ... ... like the fratellis .
we'll hear them coming .
okay , hurry up .
good idea .
where you going?
to set booty traps .
you mean booby traps .
that's what i said .
booby traps !
god , these guys ...
guys , look .
it looks like a skeleton of one eyed willy or something .
give me that .
give me this thing .
oh , god !
there's no way out of here .
no , don't , don't , don't , brandon .
hey , guys , now that we've got ...
look at this .
see what i found?
guys , freeze .
don't move .
don't move .
you guys , don't move back there !
don't move !
what?
freeze !
run , you guys , run !
holy shit !
man , that was close .
wait , listen .
sounds like somebody's down there .
shut up and listen .
maybe it's a way out .
or the fratellis .
or chunk got the police .
or one of willy's booby traps .
god put that rock there for a purpose .
i'm not so sure you should move it or anything .
hello?
bats !
save me !
they're in my hair .
help !
rabies !
rabies !
rabies !
we're gonna get rabies !
but the worst thing i ever done , i mixed up fake puke at home ... ... and i went to this movie theater , hid the puke in my jacket ... ... climbed up to the balcony ... ... and then i made a noise like this ...
and then i dumped it over the side ... ... on all the people in the audience .
then ...
then this was horrible .
all the people started getting sick and throwing up on each other .
i never felt so bad in my entire life .
i'm beginning to like him , ma .
hit puree .
no , i'm too young !
no !
i want to play the violin !
not my hand !
do i get the truth?
do i get the truth , or do you get juiced?
what was that noise?
fireplace blew .
the kid's not kidding , ma .
there's a tunnel down there .
watch your hair !
they're going for the hair !
watch your veins , ma !
hey , mikey , if you can hear me , run !
run !
they're coming after you !
hey , if we keep going this far down , we'll reach china .
maybe i can go see my auntie or something .
this could get dangerous , andy .
you might want to hold my hand .
thank you .
oh , wow !
oh , neat !
that's beautiful .
guys , look !
it's a beautiful waterfall !
wow !
it's a giant piggy bank !
we're rich !
we found it !
gold and silver all over the place !
it's gold , we did it !
hold the lantern .
coins !
rich stuff .
what year was the map made?
i don't know .
probably a couple hundred years before president lincoln .
george washington .
martin sheen .
that's president kennedy , you idiot !
well , same difference !
i mean , he played kennedy once .
