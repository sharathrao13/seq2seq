it explodes .
who are you?
i can't tell you .
for christ's sake !
what's up?
i didn't call for you .
any info about mizoguchi?
you came just for that?
i need a car and some guns .
what for?
a job for her .
you're teaming up with that kid?
you called me , " kid "?
not " teaming up " .
she's a client .
come on back .
please hurry , there's no time .
i can't believe , she's ordering you about .
she's not just a kid .
quit calling me a " kid " !
it's an antique , but it'll have to do .
it's the latest model .
sure it is .
what else was there?
mount ibusuki .
do you know where that is?
this is off limits . please go back .
something happened?
we found an unexploded bomb .
unexploded bomb?
what's this " bomb " got to do with you?
what's going on?
too late .
what is that?
hey !
why don't you tell me?
the national institute of space science
mizoguchi .
yes .
you understand why
i keep you here in japan?
what about that bastard last night?
hey , karasawa !
we're still looking for him .
looking for him "?
that's a pathetic answer !
mizoguchi .
the same goes for you .
you see one rat , turn tail and run?
you haven't grown up since .
i took you out of the gutter .
huh , mizoguchi?
anyway ,
i didn't come to japan to check up on you .
i got some interesting information .
if you want to make up for last night , go and check this out .
certainly .
hey , dumb kid .
i just want to finish this dumb job , okay?
it's milly .
my name's milly , not " dumb kid " .
if i don't know what we're after , i can't help you .
tell me , for christ's sake .
you won't believe me .
that's up to me .
i'm looking for the daggra .
daggra "?
it means " enemy " in tibetan .
what the hell's that?
an extra terrestrial .
the first one arrived back there faked a crash landing .
i came back in time to kill it , from the future .
2084 ad tibet " 82 years from now , where i'm from we're being invaded by them .
the survivors are holed up in tibet where we resist to the very end .
it's a disguised spaceship?
daggra !
our latest bullet is useless !
go !
milly , go below .
tell the others we can't keep this position any longer , go !
roger !
well , how bad is it?
they are repelling our most powerful weapon !

go !
the future is in your hand !
i won't let you down !
steve !
get him !
god !
go ... kill the first one .
i'm here to prevent that war .
if that one alien is the cause of it ,
i can stop it by killing him .
i bet you think i'm crazy .
i knew something was up but ...
you believe me?
in my job , you learn to find truth .
iooking into peoples 'eyes .
your eyes say you're telling the truth .
i know now and i'm sorry .
let me help your mission .
really?
sure .
together we'll kill that daggra .
so , you should trust me , too .
get rid of this thing on my neck .
daggra "?
back in time to kill an alien?
did you make up that crap?
you can count me out .
i thought you believed me !
not a single word , idiot .
don't be upset .
show me some proof .
there's the proof .
hello , it's me .
anything on mizoguchi?
i see .
no , it's fine .
one more thing .
something else i need to know .
if there's any news in the aerospace industry , especially this week , tell me .
keep an eye on it .
thanks a lot .
let's go .
it's late .
let's wait 'til tomorrow .
there's no time .
what are you doing?
wash your hands and sit .
what's that?
eat !
why the tears?
it's good .
i said it's good jerk .
it's pretty tasty .
that's 'al dente '.
'ai dente '?
it's tricky to get right .
the national institute of space science
are you the one that called us?
yes .
that old bastard has spies everywhere .
even in a place like this .
this way .
now you believe me?
guess i have to .
but is it worth anything?
i guarantee it .
it's packed with incredible technology .
the old man sure knows his stuff .
right .
there's something else .
something even better .
proceed , dr. yagi .
what the hell?
you came to invade us?
little monster .
look , it's crying .
yes?
what?
it just started to move !
put that fire out !
contact the assault team .
we'll come back for this .
watch out !
what do you see?
what's out there?
idiot .
it's obvious .
what i've always wanted .
that thing is real power .
what are you doing?
you scared me .
what are you doing with my coat?
it fell so i picked it up .
fell?
that's right .
whatever .
what are you looking at?
nothing .
give me a break .
october 21 , 2002
why didn't you wake me? !
you got up .
messed with my coat .
what?
man found shot on street
many strange events reported worldwide .
the newsreader suddenly said
give me back the gate
the same phenomenon also occurred during ...
any information?
step aside .
take a look at this .
a composite?
it's well done .
you think it's a warning?
from the triads?
not their style .
they'd just shoot you dead .
any news?
some good stuff .
what?
first things first .
pay your dues .
didn't your parents teach you that?
so?
a bizarre explosion last night .
where?
the national institute of space science .
a research center north of here .
they turned away the fire department .
not a big deal by itself , but simultaneously , another explosion here .
six miles away , a mountain blew up .
it sounds fishy , right?
i hired a guy to find out more and he sent me this picture .
that tree is here .
something went like this .
here's a plan of the institute .
that's where it is .
let's go .
come on !
sure , but not dressed like that .
look at this .
take anything you like .
anything?
don't get carried away .
it's disguise .
fantastic !
i even got a facial !
i'll go get changed .
do i look weird?
not at all .
it's so short .
my legs feel cold .
you love it .
no , i don't .
okay , he'll do .
they're my guests .
it's that way .
sorry , mister .
i knew it'd be here .
hold on !
is that the space ship?
right .
so that stuff about the alien .
now you believe me?
hang on .
you're really from the future?
what's that?
they found us .
we'd better move .
i've got to be strong .
i must kill it .
what now?
is this it?
what do we do?
here goes .
quick !
don't just stand there !
this isn't it .
this creature isn't daggra .
what?
something's wrong .
this can't be it !
isn't this what you're here for?
i don't know , the others looked different .
what do we do?
quick , before we get caught .
what's wrong?
i want to go home
what?
not me .
it was him .
is he contacting outer space?
what the hell was that?
he's dying .
mizoguchi .
i should've guessed .
that punk from the other night?
shut up .
you're a dead man .
what do you have against me?
remember a day in february , 15 years ago?
no , i don't .
you kidnapped my friend .
you were one of those kids?
escape with that thing .
who's that?
forget it .
use that watch thing .
this?
of course !
i've only got one .
i'll be okay .
wait in the car .
attack !
i said , " attack " !
who the hell is he?
take that .
flatten the whole place !
all of it?
all of it !
we're clear .
detonate .
roger .
head downtown !
that old lady must know him .
if she plays dumb , hurt her .
yes , sir .
we hand it over tonight .
the boss himself is coming .
unstable chemicals are thought to have caused the blast .
many bodies are charred beyond recognition .
are you all right?
what happened?
he let me escape then it blew up .
i just saw on tv .
stay there , buddy !
miyamoto .
you did this?
i've been in combat .
so it was all true .
just tell me what you're up to .
now i know how you feel .
it must've been hard to talk about .
i see .
but it's not easy to swallow .
what was that creature , then?
i don't know .
maybe i should've killed him .
did i mess up?
what did he make you say?
i want to go home
that's it .
wait a minute .
i heard something similar .
was it on the news?
yes , that's right .
newsreaders everywhere , speaking odd .
now you , too .
what did they say?
i'm trying to remember .
give me back the gate "?
give me back the gate
the mothership's come back , right?
demanding his return .
the little one wants to go home .
just like a lost kid .
they didn't let him , so his people got mad .
could it be right?
we heard that the little one summoned the mothership to invade earth .
it's a good cover up .
humans are good at lying .
especially guilty ones .
they'd soon shift the blame to the alien .
the war was caused by
us humans .
if that's the case , you two are in deep trouble .
it's mizoguchi .
he's trying to kidnap it
what?
it makes perfect sense .
he's a dead man .
what do you mean?
mizoguchi kills the daggra and starts a war .
it's okay .
we've got 'til tomorrow , right?
find out where he's going .
it'll cost you .
whatever you want .
they're here .
go out the back .
take the bike .
i'll see you later .
you believed me?
in my job , i only trust people's eyes .
get going .
she's late .
what's that?
it was my brother's .
are you regretting this?
it's not like i had any choice .
i grew up on the street of the mainland .
on the street?
right .
nowhere else to go .
i had a best friend , called xi huan .
we grew up together .
causing mischief , thieving , fighting .
one day , i came back to find all my friends rounded up .
i was too scared to help .
it was mizoguchi .
he gutted them , sold their organs .
xi huan was one of them .
i've been after mizoguchi ever since .
killing him is all i care about .
now i guess we're in the same boat .
i'm hungry .
let's eat " al dente " .
that's the method .
you mean , " spaghetti " .
how come it didn't explode?
oh , that .
a free sample from a drug store .
magnetic therapy
magnetic therapy?
dumb kid !
how dare you?
how did you smash the bottle?
oh , that .
watch my gun .
no way .
you're late .
not even " thank you "?
i've been hard at work .
they're meeting on an oil rig , some time before sunrise .
which is 5 : 42am .
here's some gear .
enough?
why so generous , all of a sudden?
strike while the iron's hot .
i see .
get going .
they're behind me .
in front of my store , too .
can we make it?
don't worry .
i left a gift in their car .
you'll be fine .
come see me when it's over .
thank you .
bitch !
behind us !
i thought she took care of them?
hold on tight !
what did you do?
nothing .
can i really alter the future?
it's a bit late to worry about that .
but what if we die?
don't worry .
we'll get mizoguchi first .
and get daggra home to his friends .
there's plenty of time 'till sunrise .
you're right .
we'll be fine .
but if we succeed , then what?
what do you mean?
if we prevent the war will i be sent back to the future?
i guess so .
i see .
i'm the one to feel sorry for .
i work my butt off for no money if it goes well , my client disappears .
you don't know that .
you will , i know .
don't say that .
i'll come rescue you , some day .
i'll return the favor .
promises , promises .
i look forward to it .
i'll return .
i promise .
october 22 , 2002
what's wrong?
why are you like this?
what's this worth to you?
are you in your right mind?
i didn't come here to negotiate .
and when you address me you will speak chinese !
i have a proposition , old man .
in return for what you want how about i get control of japan?
i don't understand .
this isn't like you .
acting all tough .
i'll be nice and pretend i didn't hear .
okay , i'll keep it for myself .
i see .
that's a pity .
what's the meaning of this?
you think you can get away with it?
my people from china will come for you .
i've already considered that and i feel untouchable , right now .
i wanted to tell you how i hated
speaking chinese .
only two hours 'til sunrise .
intruders .
what?
who's that kid?
two bogies heading to you lead them to bay 6 .
where's the cargo bay?
down the hall on the right .
i've got a question .
on my signal , run .
why do you want that creature?
or do you know something i don't?
check this out .
now !
go , i'll cover you .
got it .
where are you , milly?
damn .
your best friend fetched a good price .
thanks to you .
go .
mr. mizoguchi
what do we do next?
hey , street kid .
come on out .
let's talk .
i said " come out " , didn't i?
next time , in her head .
5, 4 , ...
miyamoto !
the rest is up to you , buddy !
3 , ...
stay there , buddy !
2, 1
milly , duck !
miyamoto !
what is it?
what's wrong?
it's no good .
it's weaker by the minute .
not long left .
did you get it to talk?
that's what you're here for .
hey , ugly !
how do your weapons work?
say something .
that's not going to help .
please be quiet .
any changes on the space ship?
if we can't use the weapons , it's just junk .
it's over .
if he dies , it's all over .
who are you , anyway?
how come you know about this?
tell me everything .
he's going to die .
then the war begins .
war?
he's got to return to the mountain .
back to his own kind .
war , huh?
sounds like fun and profit .
but i'll save him .
all by yourself?
you really messed up .
now he knows where to find this .
what do you mean?
you misjudged my buddy .
who's she calling " buddy "?
what's going on?
i can see the bullets .
let's take the chopper .
with the pilot .
stay where you are .
a slow death for you .
move .
keep moving .
milly !
where are you?
no idea .
head upstairs !
the heliport's on the roof
okay .
got it?
there's no exit .
keep looking .
sunrise .
damn .
he's going to die .
it's no use .
we'll never make it .
i knew i'd never change the future .
dumb kid !
it's no time to cry .
it's my fault .
i'm useless .
what was the point , miyamoto?
i wanted to help you .
listen , you dumb kid .
you were amazing .
getting this far , all by yourself .
you can make it .
i know .
don't give up yet !
i'm with you .
damn .
milly !
miyamoto !
we can make it by chopper .
so close , yet so far .
i hope it's well built .
what are you mumbling?
who are you calling now?
the cavalry .
that hurt .
don't move .
you messed up everything .
but now you die .
goodbye , sewer kid .
what was that?
daggra , i guess?
a disguised spaceship?
it's over .
i guess so .
no war then , i hope .
i'm sure .
i wonder if xi huan's forgiven me .
he's grateful .
what do i do now?
need an assistant?
i'm smart , useful .
i can even learn to cook .
i'm starving .
let's eat " al dente " .
i told you that's not ...
you said that on purpose , right?
dumb kid .
miyamoto !
what now?
what's wrong?
ta dah !
i guess i'm going back .
you're kidding .
don't go yet .
you're leaving already?
i'm sorry .
it sucks .
you're sorry?
you really have to go?
miyamoto !
thank you
wait a second .
you've really gone?
we're not eating " al dente "?
i don't have work for you .
i wanted to talk .
after all i taught you?
i'm sorry .
without a gun , who are you?
what'll you do?
i've got to look for something new .
watch out .
you made a lot of enemies .
i know .
thanks for everything .
i wonder if she got back okay .
i paid you back .
milly
i'll come rescue you , some day
what are you looking at?
nothing
i'll return the favor
promises , promises
i look forward to it
i'll return .
i promise
so you did return .
good luck .
the mission is completed .
i've established contact with the target and was not found .
i'm going to return .
dumb kid .
