i'd say i'd have to be a bigamist .
this is foolproof foolproof !
you said you were finished with that .
i was , but i've been kicked from stupid little job to job .
you like the way we live?
it beats your old residence .
you think i like looking at you through glass talking over a phone?
frenchy , you stood ... you stood by me !
yeah ...
granted , you stood by me .
two years i waited , and what did i get?
you got belgian chocolates !
what's wrong with that?
god , i got an idea , this is so incredible , but i need money .
we need seed money for this , we need 18, 000 bucks .
denny and tommy kick six and i gotta put in my six .
how can those bums get that?
they didn't go to harvard but ...
they were drafted before they finished kindergarten !
you're such a snob , frenchy !
denny's not stupid because he drives a truck !
no , he's stupid because he has a low iq .
i'd like to flatten you once .
oh , yeah ...
tommy's got street smarts .
yeah , his brain's got potholes .
she's got an answer for everything .
forget it !
i'm not spending our last bucks !
i got my end !
i said i could .
well , he can't get his end .
frenchy , i gotta have that money .
yeah , maybe if you needed a quadruple bypass .
this is brilliant !
no , ray is a genius .
compared to you , this chair is a genius .
no , this is the plan of a great mind .
i can't believe you're just a dishwasher .
thank you .
i don't get your agreeance , i count to three ...
you can count to 53 , i did a lot of nails for that money .
that's all you wanna do?
nails?
take a hike , ok?
frenchy , i i'm countin '...
oh , yeah?
if i lose it , you're gone .
i'm quaking .
you're embarrassing me !
how did you get a cookie?
one cookie?
hey , guys !

share of what?
yeah , i sold some stuff .
what?
a rented car .
he can't get his .
what are you tellin 'him?
the candy didn't work , then?
will you shut up? !
all that's missing from him is some velvet and a pet mouse .
frenchy , gimme the money .
i wouldn't invest it on a legit idea , much less something that'll land you back in stir .
you said you call the shots .
for god ...
will you knock it off?
jesus ...
frenchy , that money's mine .
it's mlne , i earned it .
but i'm your husband ...
take a hike .
frenchy , i ...
i'm gonna get violent .
oh , yeah?
with your hernia?
fellas , i can't do it , it's over .
forget it .
but you said you're the boss .
stop telling me what i said !
frenchy , it's over .
let the bank lay there , let someone else do it .
i i gotta get some air on the roof .
don't jump , you're too valuable as a dishwasher !
knock it off !
can i have another cookie?
no !
all right , tell me your idea .
i told you my idea .
you shot it down .
you gonna tell me or have a tantrum?
you know , for some reason you're always shooting down my dreams .
because your dreams are like the ones people get from putting opium in brownies .
can i just tell you this?
you're not a bank robber .
your two year vacation proved it .
not as a stick up man , that's all .
when i hit that bank that time , we were inexperienced , the whole group of us all put on ronald reagan masks so it was confusing , i didn't know who was who .
you're lucky your lawyer knew the judge !
can i tell you my idea? !
'a few weeks ago , a couple of doors down from the bank ,
'a pizza joint there folded and it's for rent , frenchy . '
and then it hits me , and believe me , i'm no genius ...
yeah , you don't have to sell me . .. but i figure we tunnel under , take the pizza joint , we come up under the bank vault .
i know the layout cos i used to know a guard i got diagrams .
we clean out the vault , we go to florida .
ray , we're poor but we're happy .
no , you're always complaining .
are you happy doing cuticles?
is that what you want?
mother said never get involved with a guy from the rackets .
frenchy , what's wrong?
we had dreams .
what's gotten into you?
did ... did we not have dreams?
when we met , yes , granted , i was in rackets .
i was running numbers , you were an exotic dancer , your parents didn't approve .
i tried to go legit , ok?
i know .
what do you want me to do?
'b but this pizza place is just waiting for us . '
ray , it's gonna look suspicious , a group of guys drilling in an empty store .
no , that's where you come in , you front it .
what?
you front it , you make pizzas .
i can't cook pizzas !
so cook cookies !
what's the difference? !
tell fortunes , you look like a gypsy , make it a travel agency .
you work there and we tunnel under into the bank .
god ...
frenchy , come here .
you see how beautiful this is?
yeah .
what you see , it's not just new jersey .
when we first met there was a sunset just like this , very ...
remember?
mm hm .
yeah .
but in columbia there was an earthquake !
sorry , the location was taken by someone else .
what? !
yesterday .
i told you , if you waited too long ...
who did?
wh who took the place?
can you give me ...?
you got the name?
mrs neddy goldberg .
oh , jesus .
for what?
i believe a flower shop .
a flower shop?
it's a little old lady , her husband just died and she wants to start a flower shop .
somebody's got to get to her .
get to her what?
beg her , con her .
i'll go to her shop and threaten her .
no , you can't .
don't do that .
i gotta talk to her .
and say what?
if her husband just died , you need a plan .
i don't know .
i'll charm her .
what are you gonna use for charm , ray?
knock it off .
some master plan , you lost the lease .
i'll get it , that's what this is about .
you're gonna rob a bank and some little old lady has it first .
very funny , what ... you ... you ...
i'll slam your head off .
hey !
jesus .
the bank isn't even next to the pizza joint .
i told you that before !
that's what's great ...
what?
there's nothing suspicious .
the only thing suspicious is your sanity .
and when did you guys ever dig a tunnel? .
it's no big deal .
you underestimate ray's personality .
he's the most likeable dishwasher i ever met .
don't pay any attention to her , we're gonna proceed .
uh ...
yeah?
i'm looking for neddy goldberg .
who wants her?
uh , i got something for her .
i wanna make her a big offer .
big dough .
blg dough .

i'm neddy goldberg .
i know you ...

oh ... oh , god , ray !
ray !
ray !
how are you?
you look like i'm a stranger !
i'm sorry , come on in .
it's a small world .
you leased that empty store?
yeah , i'm gonna open a flower shop .
what you gonna do with that?
burn it down .
you're still burning stuff down for insurance?
that's how i sent two kids through college .
there's no money in that !
that's ...
you ...
benny , you gotta come in with us .
who's us?
what?
why are you so suspicious?
it's me , ray ...

that's what they called me .
but ray , that was sarcastic .
no , that was real .
no , it was sarcastic .
there was nothing sarcastic !
no , it was .
benny , it was real .
i was ...
it was sarcastic .
it wasn't sarcastic ...
oh , god .
oh , god !
i was the brain !
it was sarcastic !
fellas , this is benny .
he's in .
benny?
looks like a cop to me .
how you doin '?
you know you're workin 'with a genius?
we're all smart , but he wears glasses .
yeah .

pine , right?
oak , redwood .
redwood is what woodpeckers peck on .
it's supposed to be the strongest .
good trees , right?
yeah .
this looks good .
whoa , look how long it is .
we could build a house .
we're just building a tunnel .
whoa .
or , like , a house .
yeah .
how much is that?
1, 000 bucks .
1, 000 bucks a box?
jesus !
how many sticks in a box?
50 .
my god , this is ... this is robbery .
this is unbelievable .
what do we need this dynamite for?
what?
just be careful ...
i don't like the colour ...
ohh , phew !
can i have one of these?
uh , ok .
one of these?
mm hm .
ok , you want a bag?
no , that's ok .
i haven't got a bag .
you'll take 'em like this?
it's a lot of work , but when it's over we're all gonna be well compensated .
who's gonna work the drill? .
what do you mean?
i don't know how to .
there's nothing to that .
whoever's working it , i tell ya , it's gonna make a lot of noise .
no , no , hey , what do you think this is?
we wrap this blanket around it , it's fine .
no , no , you gotta know how to work that .
whoa !
shut it off !
guys , shut up !
what did you do? !
we ain't started yet .
what are you waitin 'for , the drilling season?
do me a favour , go upstairs and bake , will ya?
you know , i i don't need any help .
got it?
you better brace me .
you said you were fine !
what are you doing? !
get that thing !
get that thing !
got it? !
yeah , i got it !
i can't hold it !
i'm gettin 'out of here !
i can hear somebody in the store !
could we have half a dozen of the chocolate cinnamon?
we're closed .
for easter .
that was three months ago .
greek easter .
that was two months ago .
chinese easter !
i'd like a cookie for my daughter .
honey , what kind?

yeah , sure , take a cookie .
how you doing?
oh ... hi !
you still open?
yeah , yeah , sure .
two cherry cinnamon .
cherry cinnamon , right .

what's all that noise?
that's ... the cookie press .
it needs oil .
there's ... a slight leak ... downstairs .
this is the plumber .
there's a tiny leak .
what do i owe you?
oh , no charge .
thanks a lot .
take it easy .
i gotta get some sandbags !
oh , the cookies are 85 cents for ...
get the sandbags !
relax , you're a perfect fit !
where are the sandbags? !
just relax !
ok , so we got off to a shaky start .
yeah , i'd say it was shaky , yeah .
frenchy , there's gonna be glitches , so what?
tomorrow i'll bring a bathing suit .
i'm not discouraged , cos i don't get discouraged .
there was a woman on before , she's got 200 pairs of shoes .
you'll get yours frenchy , i promise you .
this time in a month or two we'll be in miami , it'll be great .
a patron of the arts " , don't that sound great?
frenchy ...
opening night at the opera .
i love you , frenchy , you know why?
because you back me all the time .
you know when i first knew i loved you?
this was a long time ago if you remember .
remember i taught you how to open a safe by listening to the tumblers , and you got it .
that's when i knew .
you're a very romantic man , and i'm very lucky because not many wives get to see their husbands battling a ruptured water main .
i'm crazy about you .
i'm crazy about you .
here , benny .
benny , put it in the bag .
you ...
i'll ...
he puts it in the bag .
this is efficiency .
hurry up !
what ...
why are you putting it in his shovel? .
he puts it in .
it's called efficiency .
it saves energy .
chocolate chip , please .
here .
little girl , what do you want?
chocolate fudge .
ok .
you can only have two .
what are you stopping for?
why?
i'm trying to figure this out !
according to this , we're supposed to take a left turn .
that doesn't mean stop !
let's go !
will you give me a ...
what the hell are you doing?
what?
you got your hat on backwards .
yeah , so?
the flashlight goes in the front !
but it looks cooler like this .
what are you , a jerk?
it's a lot more stylish than that look at that !
you think so?
yeah , turn it around .
this is chic .
yeah , look at that .
that's cool .
you got a mirror?
no , i don't .
that looks good , i'll show you when we get out .
can you keep going , please?
i'm trying to figure the map out !
you want two?
ok , ok , everybody hold on .
that's 1 . 70 , that's it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
ok , here ... chocolate chip ... what you gonna do with your share?
how much is my share?
well , i figure there's gotta be two million ,
i'm counting the jewellery too .
divided four ways , that's a half million bucks apiece .
what about frenchy?
she's just a front .
but without her we're dead .
any broad could sell cookies .
i say she gets a share but not a full share .
i'd go for that .
what if we each get a fourth and she gets , like , a third?
she'd be getting more than us .
how you figure?
where you gonna get four fourths and a third?
i don't do fractions .
let's not get greedy .
remember that bogart movie where they're digging for gold?
they find the gold and then this guy turns on his friends .
let's not let that happen .
and he's killed by hispanics .
the treasure of ...
treasure island .
right !
that was a good movie .
the best .
ok , folks , here's the deal .
i'm out of cookies , ok?
it's gonna be another two minutes .
that's the way the cookie crumbles .
i've got one cookie left , you know who's gonna eat this?
me .
i gotta put on help .
help?
yeah , i can't handle the volume .
what ...?
a second person?
i can't help it , ray , the cookies are selling .
gee , i never counted on that .
you gotta manage it somehow .
what about my cousin may?
we can trust her .
may's a dodo , i bring a dodo into a master plan?
she's not a squealer .
but we'd have to cut her in .
the pot's getting smaller and smaller .
well , i can't cook and sell at the same time , it's a madhouse , we'll get caught .
hey , you know what we could do?
may ...
we could hire may and not tell her what we're doing .
and she ... she'll never catch on .
she's got , you know , and ...
we're making enough from the cookies to pay her .
absolutely , she'll never figure out or catch wise to anything .
if you think denny's slow , your cousin may is dumb like a ...
like a horse or a dog or something .
maybe it's not such a great idea .
no , i think ...
i think we could do it .
where are we?
supposed to be here .
excuse me !
where's the sugar?
frenchy wants sugar .
may , stop bothering us , we're busy here .
i just don't understand the drilling .
i told you , business is good , we're expanding .
yeah , a little tea shop so people can eat cookies and drink tea .
where are they gonna drink the tea , in the tunnel? .
i'd explain it but you gotta understand engineering .
what's engineering?
may , do me a favour , i told you , we're expanding .
but there's a nail shop next door .
we made a deal with them .
you're expanding into there?
may , get your stuff .
you want the sugar ...
take a hike .
get the sugar and go , we'll call you .
this broad's big trouble .
is it safe having that broad around?
she's harmless .
i think we've made a wrong turn .
oh , please !
give me the map .
what're you talkin 'about?
for god's sakes .
this is fine , i don't know what you're in a dither about .
you're holding it upside down .
i am?
you were reading this upside down all along?
get off my back .
can i help it if they print these things like this?
ok , thank you very much .
i gotta get another plate of the ... cherry ...
can i help you?
next?
i'm coming right back .
can i get two cherry cinnamon?
how you doin '?
we're doin 'something right !
two cherry cinnamon .
you new here , huh?
no , this is my first day .
these are the greatest cookies i ever tasted .
oh , really?
we're expanding .
no kidding?
yeah , some guys are working right now ,
tunnelling under next door .
really?
yeah .
did you try the fudge?
we were talking about what a success this place is .
about the restaurant .
what restaurant?
you know , the guys in the back tunnelling under the nail shop?
what are you talking about?
the tea room .
may , come here !
we're at the sunset bake shop where the lines wait patiently for the most fabulous cookies in new york .
what's goin 'on here? !
and you're the heart of sunset cookies , miss ...?
frenchy winkler .
frances , but everybody calls me frenchy .
standing here , one can inhale the aroma of chocolate , cinnamon and a dozen other mouth watering taste treats .
is it true customers wait half an hour for a cookie?
that you've rationed sales?
well , it happened once but ... what's all the fuss?
where did you learn the secret of your baking?
it's all i can cook , that and linguine with turkey meatballs .
sir , how is your cookie?
i don't know , it's baked with nutmeg or something .
but it's great .
and we're expanding , there are men in the back tunnelling ...
no , no , may !
get back !
i can't take this , frenchy !
we don't want this attention .
i didn't hire a publicity agent , they just showed up .
i know , but it's putting us in the toilet !
i can't concentrate , there's people demanding cookies , and denny got bit by a rat , he needed rabies shots .
who , the rat?
funny .
you should be on tv .
i am !
open your eyes !
frenchy , i don't like this .
you've been digging for weeks , when you gonna get somewhere?
it's complicated , we keep getting lost !
the other day i was in deep and my hat went out .
that stupid coal miner's hat?
it's a life saver , that bulb !
we'd do better just with a cookie store , we're making good dough .
hey , making good dough !
it's a cookie store but we're making dough .
we're making dough but ...
i get it .
i knew we were going the wrong way !
what are we doin 'in a dress shop?
at least it's a sunday , we can patch this up and get out .
patch it up? !
tile it !
i'm not a tiler .
we don't have any tiles !
where do you get cement in a dress shop?
besides , braln , how can you close the hole and tile it?
we're inside the store !
how do we get out?
well ...
he's got a point .
you can't tile it from that side .
no kidding .
no , you can't .
this is very discouraging , guys , i'm ready to pack this in .
everybody freeze !
ray , your wife's cousin talks too much .
sorry to spoil your expansion plans ...
officer , listen , we didn't do anything yet .
it's true , we were gonna ... rob the bank but we screwed up everything except for the cookie shop , that's doing great , you like the cookies !
let us forget all this and just concentrate on the cookie store .
hey , look , i'm not trying to ruin anybody's life , ok?
then , give us a break .
think i could get a piece of the action?
i don't mind paying off the cops .
it's a standard business expense .
don't think of it as a pay off .
i think i'm qualified to make a major contribution to this whole enterprise .
my brother in law majored in business .
let us hear this contribution .
one word .
yeah , and that word is?
franchise .
'we got about 600 trucks and we're all over the country
'and canada , and we make a lot of different cookies now .
'we got pistachio , we got pretzels ,
'we make chicken chip cookies , tuna mint ... '
'virtually overnight ,
'the winklers and associates have gone from a small cookie shop
'to something approaching a baking empire . '
this is where we package everything , you know?
and , uh ... we , uh ... the cookies have a wonderful fresh smell and that's put on with a chemical spray .
we do that here .
there's no denying he's refreshingly down to earth for a corporate executive .
in fact , sunset farms has captured the imagination of the public and the industry .
we wondered what the competition thinks , so we went to american cookies .
the bottom line is they make a great product .
and everything else pretty much takes care of itself .
this is your office?
yeah , this is where i operate .
frenchy decorated this place , she's got ... all her stuff here .
this is an antique , you know .
she says it's louis the ...
i don't know , louis xlv , or xv .
i don't know how high the louis go , actually , but it's a top louis , one of the ...
and frenchy stuck a tv in it , you know , because she's got a ... you know , she's a creative decorator .
it's very original .
um , how much are you worth?
oh , plenty .
plenty .
how much?
between you and me .
a lot .
i mean , whatever you see is antiques .
you know , this thing here , this is from the renaissance or the magna carta or something but that's where it's from .
why did you decide to go into baking so late in life?
well , frenchy , we found out , can make cookies .
'the frenchy they're talking about
'and culinary genius of sunset is frances fox ,
'the wife of the ceo . '
so everybody told you how delicious your cookies were?
i thought they were bsing me .
really?
yeah , cos someone gives you something they cooked you always say you enjoy it even if you threw up , so , you know .
in an age where everyone has public relations handlers it's hard to imagine a group more direct and less image conscious than sunset farms .
each person we met seemed more eccentric than the last ,
like tommy walker , the chairman .
frenchy makes the best cookies in the world .
we're very proud .
what are your duties as chairman?
the board meets twice a week and we take up issues .
issues?
yeah , facts , problems , things like that .
what problems does an overnight success like sunset farms face?
last week the toilet on the fourth floor wouldn't flush .
the water kept coming to the top , so the board voted on getting a plumber .
'an architect of sunset farms 'unorthodox marketing strategy
'is head of advertising , denny doyle , a former truck driver . '
did you have the idea to advertise in playboy , penthouse and hustler?
i figured if a guy's staring at a naked piece of tail , he sees the breasts and the legs , he's gonna salivate .
so if he's salivating and turns the page and comes across a picture of our cookies , he thinks maybe that's why he's drooling .
it's psychology .
it's science .
it's like pablo's theory , with the dog when he feeds him?
pablo?
pablo , with the dogs .
'then there's ex police officer ken deloach ,
'in charge of distribution .
'and benjamin borkowsky , in charge of plant safety . '
i made sure the building was fireproof .
'and lest they be accused of being a male club ,
'may sloane handles public relations and physical therapy . '
i understand public relations , but physical therapy?
well , all the chocolate chips are put in by hand and that's really hard on the back and the leg muscles .
i do deep massage .
she's also a vice president .
so that's a brief glimpse into a corporate culture that has industry leaders and management analysts scratching their heads , wondering what sunset farms will try next .
but it may be as simple as the winklers 'chief competitor said .
you've got something people want , everything else falls into place .
or as we in tv might say , there's no accounting for the public's taste .
keep coming through with the stuff .
i think it's better the way i had it .
put the doll there .
mrs winkler?
you wanted to check the menu?
right .
stevens , bring that piece downstairs and try it again next to the fireplace .
i want a lot of nuts and crudites .
what did we say for openers?
yeah , snails .
escargot , yes , then potato and truffle salad .
by all means , but i hate those thin pieces .
when you shave it , lay it on big time .
truffles are always shaved finely , mrs winkler .
i wouldn't suggest anything overdone .
.. then poached sea bass in filo , and spinach souffle and salad and dessert .
and finger bowls .
nothing being served requires them .
you never know whose fingers need washing .
did you rearrange this again?
hold your water !
every time i come home it's like walking into a strange house .
did i tell you to get rid of this?
it's a harp .
you got no flair , ray .
nobody plays the harp .
who plays it?
what's it doing in the living room?
i like the visual sweep .
you know , i don't know what's gotten into you , you're so hoity toity all of a sudden .
my cookies pay for this , so turn it off .
what's for dinner?
and don't tell me it's little sparrows on a bed of lettuce , cos i never want anything on lettuce again .
they're pheasants and you ate 'em .

but when we talked about making it , we were gonna hit it big , move to florida , swim , eat stone crabs ...
we can get a place in palm beach .
palm beach is ritzy .
i want to go to miami , be at the dog track every day .
i just wanna be as far away from frenchy fox the topless wonder as i can be .
hey , you were beautiful as frenchy fox .
you'd come out , remember you'd give it a little of this?
those days are over .
and our accountants want us to be twice as big next year .

no , not yet .
nor have i. what is it?
ray , why are we standing in the hallway?
please , let's retire to the living room .
are you a fan of the ballet , mrs winkler?
i used to be a dancer , but , please , call me fren ... frances .
frances fox winkler .
the foxes from saratoga?
i don't know , i never checked my pedigree .
can we change the music?
i feel like i should be wearing a wig .
you will be soon .
did you do the place yourself?
they say i have a flair for decorating .
this rug lights up .
it lights?
yeah , it's made of fibre optics .
i'll turn it on later .
stevens , what's with the snails? !
w w why don't i get the door and you show them your collection of leather pigs?
do you play the harp , frances?
no , it's a visual , honey .
the sweep kills me .
oh , finally .
girls ...
hey , how you doin '?
come on in .
right there , all the action ...
hey , honey?
toots?

how you doin '?
garth steinway .
garth steinway .
garth ...?
yeah .
i'm anthony gwynne .
oh , no kidding?
you're the outfielder with the padres?
our goal is to raise $2 million , then the company can tour the west coast and include the new opera .
right .
well , count me in .
i love serious music .
ray , on the other hand , opera freaks him .
have you tried your finger bowl? .?
so the guy says , " what do you do for a living?
he says , " i'm a monback .
he says , " what's a monback?
you know , i stand behind a truck saying " 'monback " !
h he stands behind the truck , he goes " 'monback " !
he says ...
i think it's too fast for her .
'monback .
he says 'monback .
i do think they overpaid for the picasso .
i mean , for me it was unusually mediocre , don't you think?
i agree completely .
excuse me , i have to go find my wife .
i saw a beautiful painting of fruit at the met or the whitney , it might have been the holocaust .
are you affiliated with any of the museums?
no , i'm a private dealer .
we have one or two paintings but i haven't gotten around to ...
building a collection .
uh huh .
so what are you interested in?
er , rembrandt , picasso , michelangelo .
you know , the boys .
yeah , yeah .
i might be out of michelangelos at the moment .
but i have come into possession of an incredible damon dexter that someone's trying to sell , is he ...?
i'm not aware of him .
no , well , he's new , you know .
i have to say , your wine is absolutely delicious .
really .
the chef who did the finger bowls chose it .
have you rinsed?
david used to own a vineyard , so he's a tough audience .
did you study art at school? .
no , i didn't .
i think i should have .
no , i studied literature .
then inevitably wound up as a stockbroker , then i dropped out , went to japan and became a buddhist blah blah blah , and then i did teach art for a bit .
and then the vineyard .
my god , what a life , and you're still so young !
don't be fooled .
somewhere in a closet there's a portrait of me ageing .
in the closet?
why would it be ...?
oh !
how droll .
you hear about the polish carpool? .
every day they meet at work .
i can't believe this room .
this takes bad taste to new heights .
this is excruciating .
and can you believe them?
i can't keep a straight face .
and this apartment , the flawless vulgarity .
she must've been frightened by a leopard .
i think they plan on being very generous .
and the house?
not to mention her clothes .
this is the definition of bad taste .
i never saw so much jewellery .
it makes me sad that i don't have to steal any more .
really .
what's the matter , honey?
you've been quiet all night .
what's bothering you?
what's bothering me is that we got no class .
speak for yourself , i was very charming tonight .
ray , i went to sit in the bar .
they were in there talking about us .
you shoulda heard 'em .
and they were right .
we got more dough than all of them .
it ain't dough .
it's knowing the finer things .
like what?
opera?
like food and wine and painting and books .
stop it , will you?
i'm unimpressed .
all my life i've been ignorant , i could never afford to learn .
and i was a good student ...
well , i was a lousy student and i always hated school .
if i could find my school principal today ,
i'd put a contract out on her .
class is something you can't fake and can't buy .
i got more class in my little finger than them .
we came into a few bucks but we're phoneys , we're trying to act like big shots .
not me .
well , me .
but the time has come to use our dough to amount to something .
like what?
to change our lives .
i'm too busy to change my life .
doing what?
playing pinball? .
i don't wanna wear a tux any more , i wanna go to florida and swim .
well , i wanna be the real thing .
wise up , because if i grow and you stay as stupid as you are , we're gonna have big problems , ray .
smarten you up , is that what you said?
yeah , you said you were a teacher , you know art , opera , books , wine , you know , we want to learn it all , don't we , ray?
i'm flattered you think i'm capable of ...
turning two slugs like us into classy items?
no homework .
i never did any when i was young , i'm not ...
you know , not doing anything that's got homework .
naturally , we'd make it worth your while , david .
no , it's absolutely not about money , it's just that ... i've never been asked to do anything like this .
i'm not sure i'd know where to start .
i know i gotta get a better vocabulary .
have you ever thought about enrolling in college?
i didn't go to high school , why would i go to college?
that takes four years , we want a private crash course , right?
am i crazy?
she's nuts !
david , tell her she's nuts .
what are ...
i'm gonna learn about life suddenly?
i must say , frenchy , ray has a point , you know .
he could probably teach me more about life than i could teach you .
what's he gonna teach you?
i can figure the point spread and count cards at blackjack .
close your bazoo .
i can ...
close your bazoo !
i don't want to be discouraging because what you propose is admirable ...
i'd like to be able to spell connecticut .
don't ask why , i never knew how to spell connecticut .
fair enough .
you could teach him that , right?
yeah .
you said this is a slow period in the art market and we would take ver y good care of you , right?
like i say , i don't want to discourage you ...
i'd just have to think about it a bit , i haven't ...
if i could envisage a plan , a starting point .
we could start by , you know , building our art collection .
you'd make a few bucks and we can learn something .
but i'm not going to museums .
the ... pictures spook me out ...
virgins ...
what are you laughin 'at?
spooked by the virgins !
i'm sorry .
work on the laugh .
you can see the difference between this tintoretto and the earlier byzantine painting we looked at .
what would you say is the most significant difference?
i would say that the frame's bigger here .
mm hm .
yeah , it is bigger , but there's also a difference in the paintings themselves and it's important because it characterises the great technical leap from the ancient into the modern world .
you remember how the saints had very flat faces and the background was on the same plane as the foreground?
perspective .
right , perspective .
let me show you another very good example of that .
the frame on this one is bigger "?
oh , boy , you are a dummy .
hey , don't give me " perspective .
take a hike , will ya?
28 .
four .
lev axle .
51 .
you niv dee can .
87 .
90 .
darvo sed .
four .
red do .
10 .
i'm hungry .
learn something .
there's nothing to learn !
this is where henry james lived .
who?
the band leader , stupid .
married to betty grable?
yes !
no , you're thinking of harry james , who's brilliant too .
this is henry james , the author .
oh .
yeah?
this is where he lived and worked and ...
i don't care where he lived , where did he eat?
the heiress , right?
the " h " is silent .
oh .
did he write that too?
oh ...
frenchy !
frenchy , i'm still sick .
i'm weak , i can't go .
you're gonna miss an interesting " great books " discussion .
yeah , i know .
it kills me .
but i ...
i'm just gonna lay here .
see you when you come back .
hello .
hello .
ray's got a cold .
i bet 500 .
500?
see your five , raise you 500 .
i'm out .
i'll see the five , and a thou .
what did you think of the book?
well , i thought it was very romantic .
i mean , he loved her but their backgrounds were so different .
right .
so you thought it was doomed from the start?
i guess , cos he wound up dead , but i think that two people from different backgrounds can make it if , er ... the juice is there .
right .
sorry , juice is ... is?
you know , the hots .
right .
wine , would you like some wine?
i brought over a bottle of chateau margaux .
we can compare that to my clos de la roche and see the difference between a bordeaux and a burgundy .
i've got two others of the same vintage that i thought it might be fun to try .
i see the five , i raise a thou .
i'll see it , raise you a thousand more .
and a thousand .
and a thousand .
ok .
call .
read it and weep , a pair of threes .
oh , good , i thought you were bluffing .
so what do you wanna play now?
what about indian poker?
seven cards , hold them over your head , nobody sees their hand , we bet on each other's hands , high low , wild cards all the reds .
do you wanna sit down , may?
old maid?
can you play old maid?
so , um ... try this one .
well , ok .
nice nose .
yeah , the bouquet is very special .
no , i mean you got a nice nose .
me?
yeah .
i can't describe it , it's like kind of ...
it's just any old nose ...
aquiline .
yeah , um , talking of which , how is your vocabulary coming along?
oh , good .
i'm almost through all the " a " words in the dictionary .
right , right .
thing is , i'm not convinced that memorising the dictionary is the best way to improve your vocabulary .
hmm .
yeah .
you sold the damon dexter so fast and at such a good price .
that'll really take a bite out of our debts .
oliver , it's dawning on me that the opportunity has arisen for me to become quite , er , obscenely rich .
they're serious about an art collection?
no , that would be peanuts .
what , then?
well , i think that she might be falling for me .
frenchy winkler?
how much do you think she's worth , roughly?
her husband , you mean?
no , it's all in her name .
what are you saying?
i don't know , i suppose i'm saying ... people grow and marriages sadly break up and ... women remarry , you know?
fortunes , they change hands .
what is this?
it's a damon dexter , a discovery of david's .
i say it's depressing .
you wouldn't know a masterpiece if it bit you .
i refuse to look at this .
what does that mean?
it means i won't look at that wall .
oh !
you're a head case .
i bet david made a profit on this .
whose cookies pay the rent , huh?
he's making a fool out of you !
stevens , what time is it?
i no longer look at this wall .
11am , sir .
thank you very much .
david , what's this?
oh ...
oh , that?
that's a citrine necklace .
you know about citrines?
no .
they're not precious stones , but the lustre's very special .
and that?
ah ...
talking about lustre ...
uh huh .
this is very special and very , very expensive .
it's a cigarette case that belonged to the duke of windsor .
i know the duke of windsor !
he also married beneath his station , right?
he did , he did , like our friend henry higgins .
it was such a romantic story , i saw it on television .
uh huh?
ray?
ray !
what are you doin 'here?
i'm ... having chinese food .
that's what they serve in a chinese restaurant .
you want some company?
who?
who's talking to you?
me !
all right ... but where's frenchy?
she's at a concert , some piano concert with a guy .
oh .
they have take out here but they won't deliver to a concert .
don't worry about it , may .
prelude in b minor , opus 32 #
dinner was so great , may .
all that msg and the grease , it was just ...
what a treat .
i'm so sick of continental food every night .
you know , frenchy eats frogs 'legs .
do they taste like chicken?
rabbit .
rabbit tastes like frog legs?
no ...
forget it , forget it .
are you happy being rich?
it's ok .
i got a lot of charge accounts and a really , really nice apartment and a maid .
i'm still lonely though .
yeah?
how come?
the guy i was seeing left me because he was so embarrassed about being poor and hated that i paid for everything .
so i stopped paying , and that's when he left me .
yeah , i can ... understand your ...
you ... you enjoy being rich?
i hate it .
you're kidding?
no , i hate the life , you know?
it's making me lose frenchy .
what?
i mean she's outgrowing me , that's what she said .
she's a different person .
i think she's got a crush on her teacher , david .
yeah , well , he's very good looking and really bright ,
very charming and elegant ...
ok , i got the picture .
you really know how to make a guy feel good .
when you're right , you're right .
thank you .
what did you think of it?
i thought the whole evening was apocalyptic .
apocalyptic?
totally .
i really was agog .
well , me too , she's fabulous .
and i have to asseverate she deserves accolades .
have you been memorising the dictionary?
yeah .
next week the " b" s .
how do i look?
i have to say , that dress is just ... gorgeous .
see?
your influence .
low key , right?
well , that's very flattering ...
ray thinks it's dullsville .
david?
paige .
wasn't rachmaninoff inspired?
wasn't it?
i thought it might incur my animadversion
but realised it was apposite .
a ha !
i think i see drinks .
good to see you , david .
nice meeting you .
i love your friends , david .
they're so bright and cultured and refined , it's another world .
it's a world i know you'd love to belong to .
this looks a lot more civilised .
oh , beautiful .
let's take a seat here .
'anything we get , cody's in for his full share .
'that's how it is . '
you know why i respect cody?
why?
because he loves his mother .
i understand that , may .
even though he's a cold blooded killer and she encourages him , still , it's sweet .
yeah , i wish i had a mother like that .
more pepsi?
yeah , please .
and this is the best part , i love this part .
yeah ...
will you pass me the crackerjack?
what are you lookin 'at?
i happen to be noticin 'you ,
i was lookin 'at you a couple of times tonight , cos for the first time i had the thought that in a very , very strange way , you got a sweet face .
it's off beat in a kind of bizarre ... you know .
i don't know how to explain it exactly , but it's ... it's right up there .
what d'you mean?
it's a compliment , may ,
i'm trying to say a nice thing .
cos you being a relative of frenchy
i never before classified you as a human type female .
so ...
i i i was married .
a long time ago , right?
it was a really tragic story because my husband , otto , was dyslexic , and the only thing he could spell was his name .
that is ...
that's , er ...
there's no doubt about it , burgundy really goes to my head .
what did you want to talk about?
i've , um ...
well , i've ... got a little present for you .
for me?
yeah .
here .
oh ... pretty ...
i love leather books .
oh , pygmalion .
i love that story , david .
there's a little inscription .
to my favourite eliza ,
from your professor higgins , love david .
i got a confession to make .
what?
i got you a present too .
oh , no , you didn't have to do that .
it's in appreciation of all the stuff you've been doing for me .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , frenchy ...
this is ...
frances !
frances , this is ...
it must have cost you a fortune .
what good's having dough unless you spend it , huh?
this is ... this is so extravagant ...
i i'm embarrassed .
don't take up smoking , but if it's good enough for the duke of windsor , right?
well , i'm really overwhelmed and my little bernard shaw is so insignificant ...
no .
but you see i just ...
i just wanted you to know how unbelievably proud i am of you .
david , this is not insignificant .
maybe i'm talking out of turn here but ... you've just developed so much and i ...
i just feel that you belong in a world of society and high culture now .
it's frustrating because you should continue growing , you should be branching out .
there's paris and rome and the great opera houses and museums .
you should be able to cultivate the right kinds of friends ...
anyway , i , you know ...
biff .
it's hard , cos ray's not like that .
he likes watching tv in his underwear , suckin 'a bud .
well , i don't know what to say .
i can't ... can't comment on that .
can i be frank , david?
mm hm .
sometimes i think i've outgrown him .
pretty late .
you too .
what did you do?
ah , you know , i i , uh , worked late and then may and me had some chinese food .
you and may .
what did you talk about?
cartoons?
no , we went up to her apartment and watched " white heat " on tv .
till 3am?
then we went and got a pizza .
chinese food and a pizza?
i'm surprised you didn't break into the pepto bismol factory .
no , frenchy , for the first time in a long time i had fun .
i wanna talk to you , ray .
now?
david's going to europe for a month ,
i thought we might go along , see some sights .
what kind of sights?
churches , opera houses , ruins .
what are you , a stroke victim?
fly 3, 000 miles to see opera houses and ruins?
well , i wanna go .
what do you mean?
it's part of my development .
you're frenchy fox from new jersey , stop putting on airs .
david thinks it would be good for me .
i get a bad vibe about him .
you think everybody's a crook .
i wish i still was a crook , i'd feel like a person .
you haven't grown along with me .
the only thing that's grown about you is your rear end .
i'm sorry , ray , i wanna go to europe .
we're married !
you can't just go to europe with david .
i asked you to come !
cos you knew i'd say no !
my idea of fun is not going to operas and ruins .
i get enough sleep at home .
i never thought i'd say this , but maybe the time has come to re evaluate our marriage .
if you go with david , you'll have to re evaluate it big time .
i won't be held back by an over aged juvenile delinquent !
then get yourself a lawyer .
we don't need lawyers , i'll go 50\ 50 , even though it's all in my name .
you're right , we don't need lawyers because i don't want anything .
you can have the house , the business , custody of all the chocolate chips , i just want out .
you know , may , it was on a boat that i proposed to frenchy .
yeah , yeah , i know .
suddenly i'm not her type after all these years .
oh , may i tell you something , ray?
what?
you're not my type either .
what?
what the hell does that mean?
maybe frenchy wasn't so wrong to try and make something out of herself .
frenchy overdid everything .
well , you underdo everything .
there's more to life than turkey meatballs .
i don't know .
i get a bad vibe about this guy david .
it's my street instinct , but i don't trust him .
because he's younger than you , he's handsomer than you , he's much taller than you are , he's smarter than you , he's much more exciting than you .
may , don't pull any punches with me , i can take it .
women ...
you know , women like a little elegance .
it's more ...
so if i did it again i would do some things differently .
maybe i'd sit through more operas with frenchy .
especially now they got the new sony walkmans .
now you split with frenchy , you don't even work .
no , i don't work , but i got an idea for something and i want to talk to you about it .
really?
wow , what a place .
that's the home of chi chi potter , the socialite .
now , chi chi's got a necklace , it's all emeralds with diamonds around it , it's a very famous necklace , maybe you saw it in a magazine .
would it have been on tv?
i don't know , but it's been in magazines , it's famous .
i wanna ...
i could live off that necklace , if i fenced it , for the rest of my life .
remember what happened with the tunnel .
yeah , but we don't have to tunnel any more .
now , frenchy and i , we're patrons of the arts so chi chi invited us to a big party ,
frenchy's out of town , you come with me , we get the necklace .
oh .
i never heisted anything before .
there's nothing to it , i know where the safe is , i've been planning .
'i had dinner there one night and i excused myself ,
'i was very crafty .
'i went upstairs and i scoped it all out
'and found the safe and i got the whole layout in my mind ,
'so i know we can do this . '
i don't wanna wind up in jail , and if this is such a big item they'll be turning the town upside down looking for it .
no , i have a particularly shrewd mentality ,
i got a connection in chinatown .
i bring in a picture of the necklace , he makes me an exact duplicate , i switch , she never knows .
she's a ...
chi chi's a dumb , flighty society dame .
by the time she figures out there's been a switch ,
i'll be in florida or the cayman islands .
hello?
what?
i can't hear you , what?
shh .
i'm in a crypt !
i can't !
what do you mean?
what are you talking about?
how?
give me a break , sister , ok?
today? !
shh !
what do you mean it's an emergency?
i ...
oh , hi .
mrs winkler?
we're sorry to bring you back from your vacation .
what's goin 'on?
i've terrible news .
something happened to ray?
sunset enterprises is bankrupt .
how?
fraud .
fraud?
who?
your accountants .
i i i don't even know who they are .
what?
you should have looked .
we let them handle everything .
what do i know about running a corporation?
did you ever read anything you signed?
no , but they assured us everything was ok .
mrs winkler , do you want a drink?
i'd like a 1961 romanee saint vivant if we have it .
i'd have a whisky if i were you .
well , i don't understand , i mean , sunset's gone?
can't we do anything?
we could put a few people in jail if we could find them .
oh ... this is the worst news .
oh , no .
no , mrs winkler , it's not .
no?
it is to me !
no , no , the worst news is coming up .
oh .
all right .
all right , you better tell me .
let me sit down .
they talked about expanding sunset .
that's right , yeah .
to do that you needed a bank loan , are you aware of that?
quite a substantial loan .
get to the point .
you signed a promissory note to the bank .
this is exactly what i've got accountants for .
yes , but your accountants are in venezuela .
wh ...
this is all so confusing !
you put up your home and savings for a monster loan .
could you put some cyanide in here?
it needs to be stronger .
you've lost it all , frenchy .
or should i say you've been swindled out of it all? .
you mean i got ...
nothing .
you have nothing .
no house , no bank account , just some large , outstanding loans which we feel you can best deal with by filing for bankruptcy .
bankruptcy?
bankruptcy?
i'm not up to the " b " words yet .
sorry .
does ray know about this?
what difference does it make to ray?
he's gone .
what did you say?
i'm bankrupt .
sunset's gone .
worse , all my personal dough is gone .
the whole ride's over .
well ...
how could that possibly happen?
fraud .
my accountants .
ray said not to trust them because the whole firm had moustaches .
i i'm gonna get myself a little valium .
david , i can't give you that loan i promised you .
what?
what did you say?
it turns out i got people i owe .
but you did say i could borrow $400, 000 .
i was using it to cement a deal !
it kills me to cop out on you like this , but i'm busted .
what an idiot .
i guess i am , yeah .
h how could you be so stupid and irresponsible as to allow some patently cheap and thieving accountants to defraud you out of a future?
how could anyone be that stupid?
aren't you a little out of line?
i've made plans , i've made commitments to people !
oh .
you got a strange look in your eye , like the guy from the book .
dr jekyil or mr hyde or ted bundy , i can never remember .
the time i've put in nurturing an idea that's not gonna happen .
is that what it was?
the money?
i i need my prescription , my little blue pills so i'm gonna ... go and get them .
and i would very much appreciate it if when i came back you were gone .
thank you .
david , i'd like the cigarette case back that i gave you .
i don't think so .
wow .
i asked you for lessons in life .
i guess i really got one , right?
oh , we're so glad you could come !
how are you?
good .
langston wants to talk to you about a theatre project in aspen .
do you ski?
me?
no , never .
do either of you play miniature golf?
there's minky .
hello .
oh , for heaven's sake !
er ...
mingle .
i don't think you should speak .
you said make conversation ...
i know .
make conversation but don't speak .
you know , don't bring up anything .
maybe the weather , but don't ... don't ...
i'm gonna get in the flow and then kinda glide upstairs .
shall i glide with you?
no , i'll contact you .
can i get you some champagne?
uh ... sure .
ray !
i was gonna make a phone call .
have you seen edgar?
edgar?
where that man gets off to !
i was gonna make a phone call ...
i'll look downstairs .
try back there .
thank you , ray .
oh , winkler?
do you play golf?
golf?
no .
i was just gonna make a phone call ...
guess i was mis ... misdirected .
yes , i'll just go and use the phone .
i wanted a match on sunday but i'll get somebody else .
so sorry .
there'll be rain over the tri state area , and fog .
temperatures will hover in the low 60s till tuesday .
i must say , you are most amusing .
would you like a canape?
those are shrimp , these are quail eggs , and ...
i don't have any idea what they are .
thank you , i hate things with toothpicks , they lodge in your throat .
i'm george blint , mutual funds , and you?
may sloane , i'm a lookout .
i noticed the way you walked and carried yourself from across the room .
you remind me of my wonderful departed wife .
you can't carry yourself across the room , that's physically impossible .
you're charming .
you're the first woman i've met since helen died that i could say that about .
was helen your wife or just a woman who died?
where's mr winkler?
i wanted to talk to him .
oh , he's mingling .
cloudy today , wasn't it?
with a chance of light sprinkles followed by sunshine .
absolutely .
chi chi , would you get those photos in the bedroom?
i want to show mr winkler the property in aspen .
yes , i just want to talk to dr henske .
he'd be perfect to do beth kramer's face after the unbelievable job he did on mrs morton's buttocks .
oh , i'm going to be right back .
would you just ...?
ray ...
shh !
you scared me .
for god's sake .
i came to warn you ,
mrs potter's coming to get some pictures that mr potter wants you to see .
she's looking for you .
now i've closed the safe .
it's a tough safe , i'm out of practice .
did they see you come up here?
uh , i don't think so .
get out there and stand watch .
i'm gonna do this again .
are you ok?
i'm fine , i'm fine .
get out , get out !
if you could fit it in to your schedule , it would mean so much .
she's been so down since the divorce and don't you think he got custody of the pola polas .
chi chi , don't forget those photographs for mr winkler .
oh , i'll get them .
so , you will try?
i'll do my best .
kiss kiss .
mrs potter is coming !
she's gone .
shh !
she's gone .
mr winkler wouldn't go without saying goodbye , would he?
he's not upstairs .
jesus .
i met a wonderful man downstairs .
he seemed to like me .
he said i reminded him of his wife who's dead , but i assume he meant when she was alive .
may , can you stop talking while i'm doing this?
little short fella , bright yellow shirt , unbelievable tie .
oh , yes , i know the gentleman , he was going upstairs before .
are you sure?
er , yes , um ...
mr winkler .
ray , i hear something .
oh .
ooh !
she's not feeling well .
she had one of her spells .
spells?
yes , she gets spells .
we have a doctor ...
no , not necessary .
i i i'm a haemophiliac .
dear god , are you bleeding?
why would i be bleeding?
oh , no , she ...
her neck ...
there is , but my nasal passages are clearing up .
on weekends i do this for a hobby .
she had champagne , you know ...
oh , i'll get dr henske .
really ...
ray , you have my cortisone pills?
me?
my medication?
i'll feel better if dr henske looks at her .
you relax and i'll go get dr henske .
a haemophiliac?
cortisone?
where do you get this?
on tv .
i said stay with the weather !
i thought i did some quick thinking !
yes , and you're going to be examined now !
why?
i just had a check up .
jesus , i got no time to work here .
they'll be back in seconds .
i can't tell the difference between these !
then you gotta take 'em both .
i can't , if they don't find any necklace ... we've been suspiciously seen in here , i'll go right to jail !
especially with your dna !
what has my dna got to do with it?
you better choose , they're gonna be back any minute .
i ca ...
i ca ...
ray , let's go !
oh ...
grrr !
all i know is what i've told you , doctor .
she's right in here .
come along .
here's dr henske !
what seems to be the trouble?
false alarm , it was a hot flash .
i think it was menopausal , i've seen it before .
i i'm given to occasional spells .
spells?
not spells , but she ...
no , no !
sometimes for no reason i get hot and cold flashes and the room will spin and spots will flash before my eyes and i'll hear a ringing in my ears ...
you're making too much of it , may . .. and then my tongue turns black and i can't swallow .
really?
they diagnosed parkinson's but it could be ebola or mad cow disease ...
we got to go ...
it was a false positive , i think .
come on , sweetheart , we're due .
i do hope you feel better , and not to worry , mr winkler ,
aspen will have to wait .
ebola virus or mad cow?
i just said the first thing that came into my mouth .
great .
hello , again .
george .
do i still remind you of your wife?
you kill me , you're great .
you're not feeling well , remember?
i'm taking her home .
i'm in the book , may sloane .
i'll be better .
well , i'll call you .
ray , i just got the news about frenchy .
frenchy?
didn't you hear?
sunset's gone under .
she was defrauded out of every penny .
i figured you'd know .
yeah .
no , i do know .
i ... i ...
shit .
i came as soon as i heard .
i got exactly what i deserved .
you know , i missed you , frenchy .
i'm sorry i blew our cookie company but i'm even more sorry i blew our marriage .
what are you gonna do?
everybody makes mistakes .
the important thing is i still love you .
i don't deserve it , i behaved badly .
you behaved like an ass .
that's one of those " a " words you used to practise .
ass .
but i'm not the easiest guy in the world .
i'm not mr sensitive .
there's things i coulda done differently .
we stayed in separate rooms the whole trip , ray , that's the truth .
so where's david now?
he split the second i went bust .
no , i don't believe it
he was hustling me for the dough .
jeez .
so now we got to begin again , you know?
and in more ways than one .
you still want me?
still want you?
you got to ask a question like that?
i'm crazy about you .
you're a goddess to me .
i'm nuts for you .
of course i want ya .
but we're broke , we haven't got a dime .
we don't own a stick of this furniture .
can i show you something?
may i show you one thing?
ok ...
just let me ...
i think you're gonna be very , very proud of me .
that's chi chi potter's !
was ...
was chi chi ...
was !
ray !
key word , " was " .
you didn't? !
i never felt so great .
i was back in action , i felt alive .
cos i always felt ...
hey , this is glass .
what are you talking about?
how's it glass?
it's fake .
what?
how would you know?
i can tell fake , this ain't even good fake .
what are you talking about?
oh , you know , it might fool some idiot with no eye and no brains but it'd never pass with a normal person .
you're saying i got the phoney?
i came away with the wrong thing?
sounds like your mo .
nuts !
i was in the room ...
yeah .
i was gonna substitute the glass one for the real one ...
it's good to see that you got the same great instincts .
you're so wrong ...
can i tell you ...?
what?
you take those lessons ...
wait , i'm gonna show you something . .. but you know nothing about jewellery .
this is ...
we take this and fence it , go to florida ...
it's the goods .
that won't get us on the subway , much less to florida .
you're such a know everything .
you don't have to be a rocket scientist to spot a clinker like this .
whoever made it , you overpaid .
what can i do if you're wrong?
tell me .
can i take your nose and twist it till you turn blue?
sure .
gee ...
you broke it .
it's glass , ray .
i know , but ...
wh ...
eh ...
it's , well ...
i'm not cleaning it up !
you broke it !
you got glass over everything !
it's dangerous , you ...
jesus ...
i don't know what you see in me , i'm such a screw up .
it's glass !
ray ...
all that matters is that we have each other .
we didn't there for a while and it made me realise how much i need you .
but you're married to a loser , frenchy .
no , i'm the luckiest woman in the world .
and the brokest .
we got nothing .
as usual , i come up empty .
we could pawn this .
what is this?
what is this thing?
who ...?
i don't understand , who's the duke of windsor?
we could probably auction it .
where'd you get this?
from david .
david gave you this?
he doesn't know it yet .
i don't get it , what do you mean?
hey , it was you who taught me how to open a safe .
i ...
that was one of my fondest memories of our time together .
what are you saying?
you boosted this from david's safe?
frenchy , that's stealing .
not exactly .
it's a long story , ray .
let's sell it .
i'll fill you in on the flight to miami .
sweetheart , you ... are the greatest .
# oh , baby , what i couldn't do
# with plenty of money and you , ooh
# in spite of the worry that money brings
# just a little filthy lucre buys a lot of things
# and i could take you to places you'd like to go
# but outside of that i've no use for dough
# it's the root of all evil
# of strife and upheaval
# but i'm certain , honey
# that life could be sunny
# with plenty of money and you #
tequila
