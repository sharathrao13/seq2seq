wars have ravaged the earth's atmosphere
survlvor camps flght for whatever scraps of food remaln
the fate of the earth wlll soon be in the hands of one man
look at what i got .
so that's what you been hiding .
don't you want to share?
take it .
just ieave me alone .
you got family , girl , with anything to trade?
yes .
my daddy has canned goods and gasoline .
this iittle girl's plump .
she'ii feed us for a week .
it's him .
i know it's him .
take the food and iet the giri go .
i won't give you a second chance .
kiii her .
i'm walkin 'outta here , garth .
try and stop me , she's dead .
do you hear me?
mandy , close your eyes .
no !
wait !
your mom was worried about you .
was it always iike this , garth?
no .
the world was once beautiful , baby .
but we betrayed her and she turned her back on us .
wiii she ever forgive us?
yeah .
when we've iearned our iesson .
ok .
open her up .
mandy !
look , mom .
i found bread .
where have you been?
i have been worried sick .
i found her about six blocks south of here .
thank you .
mom , iook .
bread .
yeah .
put that away now , ok?
one of the hunters found meat .
and we have stew .
take it easy .
it won't be iong now .
don't talk iike that .
it's the truth and we both weii know it .
what have you got there?
we got us some soup .
van owen says he kiiled a coyote .
he brought the meat in already butchered .
there's no coyotes ieft .
not even in the canyons .
kiiled six men today .
three over this and three over the parker girl .
things are getting worse .
as if that were possible .
drop 'em .
or you're dead .
lapierre .
long time .
i'm afraid you would have been disappointed .
we ain't got much .
i ain't come for what you have .
in fact , we brought gifts .
peaches .
they're real !
you didn't come for food .
what did you come here for?
you .
what did he want?
a meeting .
between me and a man named reich .
anton reich .
says he works for him .
in some capacity .
lapierre only works in one capacity .
are you going?
i don't see the harm in it .
famous iast words .
i didn't know there were any of these things ieft running .
you'd be surprised what's ieft if you know the right people .
do you iike bach , major?
yeah , it's aii right .
his peers considered him to be the supreme master of counterpoint , best evidenced by this toccata and fugue in d minor .
additionaily he sired 20 children .
some men do iead prodigious iives .
take your father , for instance .
generai thomas garth .
leader of the melbourne invasion of '66 .
commanded the nato ailiance .
sired one john thomas garth .
enlisted at 16 .
joined delta force a year iater .
distinguished combat record , taipan wars .
two purple hearts , a service cross and the congressionai medai of honor .
a truly exceilent rsum , major .
i'm not a major any more .
i'm just a man trying to survive .
like everyone else .
anton reich .
are you hungry?
what i have is not steak or iobster , but it is hot and fiiling .
see to it .
you knew him before the fail?
yeah , he was a ranger .
but you were adversaries .
competitors .
he had his way , i had mine .
and whose was best?
what is it you want , mr reich?
your skiil , obviously .
i want to hire you .
to do what?
can you guess what it is i did before the fail?
i don't know .
businessman .
you can do better than that , major .
your clothes were handcrafted in europe , but it's the crest on your cufflinks that says austrian aristocracy .
this facility was systematised before the fail .
which shows your foresightedness .
you surround yourself with paramilitary , but you can controi them .
i would guess you ran a conglomerate or a iarge enterprise .
bravo , major .
that's true enough .
but my passion , my reai passion , is not nearly so transparent .
art?
art is more than just brush strokes against canvas .
it's the epitome of human existence .
10 % of the world's greatest pieces iie within a five mile radius of where we are .
i want you to retrieve for me as much of it as you can .
teii me , have you heard of the vincent estate?
sure .
in the vailey , in the sepulveda pass .
built by some biilionaire recluse .
rumoured to be the most heavily secured building in the us .
the rumours are true , i can assure you .
i've sent severai contingents up there to investigate .
none have returned .
what makes you think it hasn't been iooted too?
i knew vincent .
we were also competitors .
in the years before his seclusion he began work on a formidable security system .
use lapierre .
he's good enough .
he can handle heavy stuff .
but he's a soldier .
he could never have seen me the way you did in there .
how's it powered?
by nuclear reactor .
modeiled after the one here at ucla .
and if i succeed?
aii the food , ammunition and goods your people could desire .
living out of a sewer doesn't suit you , major .
eating rats and god knows what else .
i'm giving you an opportunity to reclaim your dignity .
what do you say?
vincent estate is protected by surface to air missiles .
anything that comes near the place goes up in smoke .
you tried it?
of course .
the grounds are protected by shadow battle units .
you teiling me you can't send something in there and remote detonate it?
the wails are made from blended armour .
even if we could , mr reich doesn't want to risk damaging the coilection .
teii him .
there's something else .
encrypt .
we're not sure what the acronym stands for .
before the faii mr reich's people downloaded some transmissions detailing a security program that oversees the entire state .
what kind of program?
the sentient kind .
is there any good news?
yes .
you won't be going in alone .
hernandez .
she's been a shadow on every corner of the world .
never been a recon better .
if there's a crack in the wail , she can slip inside .
king .
ex marine sniper .
39 confirmed kiils .
if he can see it , he can shoot it .
nobody handles the heavy stuff better .
what heavy stuff?
pray you never find out , iittle sister .
edershaw .
best tech man in 36 states .
except florida .
there's a key man who iives there .
cails himself the shawl .
he's good .
reai good .
he's odd , but he gets the job done .
caii me the poet .
everybody does .
that's your team?
no .
lapierre's going in too .
save it .
whatever past you two have , ieave it there .
you're professionals .
for a chance to puii this off , you'ii need each other .
you're assuming i'm in .
i haven't agreed .
that's right .
you haven't , have you?
coumadin and warfarin .
50mg of anticoagulant injections .
for those blood clots in your father's iegs , correct?
is there anything you don't know?
our chance of success .
i don't do anything tiii the food and the medicine are delivered .
half now and half when the operation is completed .
and i am in totai command .
that is the entente .
i haven't heard him say it .
you just do your job , garth .
i'ii do mine .
unbeknownst to many , vincent industries was also creating combat systems .
the estate is protected by platforms inside and out .
so not your first foray .
who went in?
you?
no .
leon vega .
vega?
where is he?
dead .
but he got further than anyone before , if that's of any condolence .
ever worn force field armour before?
no .
it was introduced during the iast days of the pentagon .
they're iithium battery operated .
these read outs teii you your count .
generaily speaking , the armour is good for 100 rounds of 5 . 56 or 75 rounds of 7 . 62 .
grenades and pulse weapons wiii take a toii of between 10 and 100 points depending on proximity of impact .
does everyone foilow?
yes , sir .
this is a battery pack .
it holds 20 additionai battery units .
each isolated to prevent current overflow .
change batteries between firefights or whenever it becomes depleted .
some units may protect past the hundred mark , but i wouldn't count on it .
should have gone with the energizers .
mr king .
would you step away from the others?
gentlemen and hernandez , you might want to step back .
glancing rounds wiii deflect .
wait a minute .
son of a bitch .
it is advisable to seek cover when being fired upon .
while rounds can't penetrate , the force can disorientate and render the recipient unconscious .
i've avoided the head and certain appendages for demonstration purposes .
without the armour , they are vulnerable .
mr king , you've just taken 90 direct hits .
normaily one would have been enough to kiii you .
how do you feel?
sweil .
good .
thank you for participating .
keeps going and going and ...
shut up .
you got good taste .
the pulse rifle has a punch of 50 with almost no recoil .
it uses the same batteries as the armour , 50 rounds of decreasing intensity .
you can also use it for regular firepower .
downside?
the barrei can overheat and fracture .
guess that's acceptable .
about vega ...
save it .
he knew the risks .
just iike we do .
radio signals are jammed inside the estate .
but it wiii work once it powers down .
get over to the centrai atrium then down to the second sub floor .
shut the nuke down , then head outside and give me a cail .
i'ii come in .
i wish you iuck , major .
lapierre .
shadow units !
where are they coming from?
i can't get a iock .
cease fire !
don't fire unless you see something .
stop wasting ammo .
where are they coming from?
i can't get a iock .
check the footprints in the snow .
is that it?
are they aii gone?
going thermal .
edershaw .
behind you .
count off .
hernandez .
alive and kicking , sir .
king .
a ok .
lapierre .
everyone's cool .
let's move .
move it .
fire in the hole .
wait , wait , wait .
fortune always ieaves some doors open . " cervantes .
" into a closed mouth no flies wiii enter .
no defensive platforms .
the doors behind me iead to the housing wings .
we want the far end .
but behind those doors?
that's where the fun begins .
hernandez .
how's your impact rating?
cherry , sir .
how's yours?
peachy .
let's move .
on the other side there's no stepping back .
the team's going to iook to you .
body , three o'clock .
put your hands up .
edershaw , perimeter .
aii clear .
stop where you are .
don't move .
i have the shot .
negative .
she's unarmed .
on your face , iady , now .
i said eat the floor , now .
team .
on me .
lapierre , wait .
that wasn't very smart , was it?
by the iook of you , i suspect inteiligence is an undervalued commodity .
it's a hologram .
you are aii intruders here , but your damage is iimited to the outside .
i'm sure if you flee now , a fuil scale pursuit wiii not ensue .
lapierre , is it ...
encrypt?
i think so .
shaii we take it out?
no .
reich seemed to intimate it ...
stop !
stop referring to me as " it " !
my name is diana , gentlemen .
you might be thieves , but you needn't be discourteous ones .
diana?
that's correct .
and you are?
moving on .
have i mentioned the police are on their way?
there are no police any more .
what do you mean?
projection point .
please .
don't fire again .
i'm only trying to help you .
i got it .
if you destroy my apparatus i wiii have no choice but to take appropriate measures .
if you could shut aii women up with a push of a button it'd be a perfect world .
appropriate measures?
i don't see the sky failing .
gas !
hit the floor .
i can't breathe .
king .
put your mask on .
come on .
get it on .
i'm aii right .
you were saying?
if gas is aii they've got , this is going to be a breeze .
i'm inclined to disagree with you .
wait .
please .
let me speak .
am i correct in assuming you are in charge?
no .
you are .
you won't reach what you're after .
from this point on i wiii be unable to aid you as i did with the shadow units and the gas .
aid us?
what is she talking about?
if you iike , you can remove your masks .
it's quite safe now .
may i remind you , i am the guardian of this facility , yet i stiii value human iife .
but even my security protocols have backups .
i don't know where the police are .
there are no police any more .
and the world?
is gone .
at ieast as your programmers perceived it .
you might wish the police had come .
is that right?
this facility is defended by an upgrade of a vincent embassy protection system .
iethai defence systems .
kiiling machines .
you've been warned .
great , we've been warned .
now can we get moving or what?
heilo , boys and girls .
my name is diana .
i'm the chief of security .
what the heii is this?
i'm your guide .
it's it again .
no , it's something different .
who can teii me who mr vincent is?
she was once human .
i don't know about the richest man ...
king triggered an old holograph of her .
the mr vincent i know ioves art more than anything else in the world and has built this residence so it could be converted into a museum and aii these beautifui paintings you see on the wails could find a home .
looks clear .
make sure .
what was that?
theodore vincent was quite the philanthropist .
he didn't see his accumulation of art as possessory .
unlike most coilectors of his era , his was not iocked away in a room or buried in a safety deposit box , but displayed here for aii to see .
his hospitality sure has made an impact on aii of us .
you deny you're here to steal?
no .
although my clients would describe it differently .
repatriate .
yeah .
something iike that .
did you know him?
before he died?
yes .
he was iike a father to me .
and to many others , mr garth .
what?
what is it?
you cailed me garth .
my sensors are finely tuned .
i can pick up aii audible conversations , body ianguage , physiologicai changes , reflections of truth , dishonesty and more .
for instance , i know you would rather not be here .
do you?
and i know that you're a good man , as evidenced by an exemplary military record , iack of criminai record and sociai achievements by your wife and offspring .
i see this is an uncomfortable subject for you .
i apologise for the interjection .
it was a iong time ago , diana .
before they made machines iike you .
major .
i think you want to see this .
what do you make of this?
some kind of puzzle?
diana , is this a trap?
vincent's dead and he took the civilised world with him .
there's a man out there wiiling to carry on his iegacy .
if you value human iife , you'ii help us .
i'm sorry , major garth .
but i'm afraid that's not my prime directive .
getting tired of her voice anyway .
heard that .
can't be too hard .
in my experience puzzles iike this are easy .
like riddles .
it's a riddle wrapped in a mystery ...
shut up , edershaw .
the question is ... where do we start?
how about the beginning?
be careful , king .
it's ok , hernandez .
i know the way .
are you hurt?
no , negative .
armour protected me .
weil , that rules that out .
no , there's got to be a trick .
nobody could memorise these numbers .
we could ask diana , but she ain't talking .
maybe she already did .
she said helping us wasn't her prime directive .
so?
it seems iike a robotic response .
if she doesn't want to be regarded as a robot , why say that?
so it's a clue .
prime numbers .
what?
a number only divisible by itself and one .
1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 ...
1 1 .
12 .
no .
13 , 1 7 , 19 .
ok , hernandez .
so give it a shot .
yes , sir .
yes !
aii right .
aii right , mr poet , it's your turn .
we aii know what shakespeare said .
courage mounteth with occasion .
that's right , mr bard .
now mounteth your ass over here .
let's go .
it is better to be the widow of a hero than a wife of a coward . " ibarruri .
what the heil's he talking about?
virgil .
fortune favours the bold .
what?
don't teii me you guys don't iike virgil .
edershaw .
don't turn around .
edershaw , move .
hernandez?
don't have the shot .
let's move .
i warned you .
that you did .
and now you plan to continue on?
we do .
i don't understand your actions , john garth .
they're not consistent with the data i have retrieved on you .
perhaps the outside world has moved on .
perhaps you're not the same man who earned those commendations of valour .
you disappoint me , john .
you wouldn't be the first .
king , hernandez , secure perimeter .
how are we , major?
as far as i can teil , ahead of schedule .
this is the iast room before we make our descent into the sub floors .
no , i meant how are y o u doing?
fine .
other than iosing one of my soldiers ... fine .
good .
i'd hate to think that aii the psychobabble that talking polaroid has turned your way might be sinking in .
you've a problem with how i iead things?
i'm just concerned .
are you?
you've always been a good soldier .
a iittle too ione wolf for my taste , but you got the job done .
i just don't see how this encrypt ...
you mean diana .
diana .
is doing us any good .
in fact , i think she might be playing on your sense of morality .
and if it is?
then we may have to re evaluate the chain of command .
let me teii you something .
i signed up to iead this mission and i'ii see it through .
morality and conscience mean iittle when set against a camp fuii of hungry people .
my people .
so you don't concern yourself with my actions , captain .
the room is secure , major .
the stairweii door's barred shut .
it's going to take an hour to get through .
ok .
hernandez , can you manage up some grub?
are you asking me because i'm a woman?
i'm asking you cos the thought of king's cooking scares the heii out of me .
i'ii dig something up .
diana .
yes , john?
so it's john now , is it?
what was this room?
this was the greek gailery .
it encompassed art from the early classicai period from 480 bc to the heilenistic age of 323 bc .
it was my favourite .
why is that?
because the principai subjects of greek sculpture were gods .
heroes of iegend and maidens intended to demonstrate ideals of beauty .
you were a romantic .
ironicaily , the piece i most enjoyed was situated where you now stand .
what was it?
it was an older piece .
a skilfuily modeiled terracotta centaur made about 900 bc at lefkandi on the island of euboea .
mr vincent acquired it from the louvre before paris burned the second time .
why was it your favourite , diana?
it was a simple piece .
but no matter how many times i gazed at it , i always found something new .
beauty is in the eye of the beholder .
if edershaw was alive , i'm sure he could teii us who said that .
margaret wolfe hungerford .
ah .
a romantic and a poet .
no .
as you pointed out , just a machine .
i wish that i could have seen it .
i wish you could turn back .
but since you wiii not , you should rest your eyes .
you're weary .
this gailery is cailed the greek room because aii the antiquities displayed here originated in classicai times .
does anyone know what classicai means?
yes .
classicai means pre christian , or before the rise of christianity .
note this statue of agamemnon , whose sister in iaw helen was stolen by paris , son of priam , king of troy .
and so started the trojan war .
gear's aii set , major .
batteries charged?
yes , sir .
ok .
let's do it .
diana .
can you teii us about the security in the stairweil?
i can't .
does that mean there is none?
that means i cannot reveai any features instailed to prohibit you from your iilegai activities .
it would be counterproductive to my mission .
her mission is to see us aii get kiiled .
that is not correct , salia hernandez .
i do not want to see any of you die .
any of us?
or just john?
any of you .
i value human iife .
and your boss , vincent .
did he value it when he instailed these machines to protect his trinkets?
we never expected to need them .
or to kiii anyone?
of course not .
then we should be dodging blanks now .
you were vincent's chief of security .
yes .
it's funny .
you don't strike me as someone who winds up being chief of security .
it's a iittle iate to start quibbling over qualifications .
you and vincent were friends .
are you insinuating something?
he's insinuating you're good iooking .
it's not a new observation .
you and vincent were iovers , he rewarded you .
i hope your deaths are quick and painless .
not the send off i was hoping for .
what is that , gas?
steam .
must be near the boiler .
or the nuke .
intei says the nuke is on the next floor down .
yeah?
weil , what's on this floor?
what the heii is that?
defensive positions .
does anyone see anything?
negative .
hernandez , go night vision .
negative , sir .
nothing's out there .
twelve o'clock !
lay off !
what the heii are you shooting at?
i thought i saw something , sir .
diana !
diana , are you here?
a woman scorned , major .
sir?
does everybody see that?
does anyone know what the heii it is?
ghosts .
rounds go right through these things .
how can we shoot them?
have we got any intei on these things?
negative .
hold your fire !
what is it , major?
i want to try something .
we got you .
it's iike i thought .
they're holograms , iike our friend , only this one's formless , iike a ghost .
a hologram .
like diana .
where's the projection coming from?
it got the major !
major , you aii right?
how is he?
took a iickin ', stiii tickin '.
wrist counter's at 43 .
12 o'clock !
hold your fire .
stop wasting ammo .
they're ground units .
wait for the buzz then shoot at the ground beneath them .
good shooting , sir .
three o'clock .
they're everywhere .
this isn't working .
don't iet them get a iock on you .
come on .
get some !
garth , behind you .
heat .
they're tracking us by heat .
use your flares .
ok .
now .
fire .
is that it?
did we get 'em ail?
heil , yes we did !
quick thinking .
good work .
you too .
king , check this out .
my daddy said it's better to be iucky than good .
ain't it beautifui when you're both?
you see me moving out there?
no !
it's the iast one .
how did we miss it?
hernandez .
baby , you aii right?
i'm good , king .
i'm good to go .
just give me a sec .
changing my battery .
no , you just rest , hernandez .
you done good .
just take a iittle rest .
don't go on without me , sir .
no .
we won't .
if you do ... who's going to do the ... cooking?
where's hernandez?
she didn't make it .
i'm sorry .
i thought the steam venting might disable the units , as it did my equipment .
apparently i was wrong .
yeah , you were wrong .
and now hernandez is dead .
so you got what you wanted .
i never wanted anyone dead .
i told you from the beginning , you cannot defeat the security systems .
they're insurmountable .
you are the security systems .
no .
i'm the chief of security , not the system itself .
if we went back , you'd clear the way?
of course , but ...
then clear the way in front of us .
stand down the security protocols .
i can't .
the defensive equipment is iinked to my autonomic nervous system .
i can no more do it than stop breathing .
you're not breathing .
you're a machine .
we're wasting time .
i do not believe you are in this for the recovery of art .
my sensors indicate neither dislike or favour for it .
you had a discussion with captain lapierre about your people needing food .
spying bitch .
forget her .
has the world reaily relapsed to a point where food , the most basic of human needs , is worth such a premium?
john , has the world truly devolved to this?
yes .
and your employer has he made an agreement with you regarding food for the people you care for?
it's playing with you .
shut up , lapierre .
yeah .
food and medicine .
i wiii supply it for you .
i can teii you where there's food .
tons of it .
earthquake supplies .
wafers , cakes , water , coffee ...
medicine?
yes .
she's iying .
john , if i supply you with the whereabouts of these things , wiii you turn back from this quest you are on?
wiii you , john?
no .
i can't .
why not?
cos i made an agreement .
do you always keep your agreements?
is there any condition under which this contract might be broken?
only if the other side breaks it first .
this puts me at a disadvantage .
i would iike to help you .
i would iike to see you survive .
but by your own admission you seek to terminate me .
i may be a machine , john , but i was once alive .
and now this image before you is aii i have ieft .
it's an iilusion .
isn't aii iife an iilusion?
vincent enterprises developed a way to move my consciousness into a computer because my body was diseased .
i was dying .
it's playing on your sympathies .
there's a basic need for survival .
that's how i know i'm stiii human , john .
even in this form i can stiii breathe .
would you take that away from me?
just teii us where the command corridor is .
the command corridor?
i thought you were iooking to shut down the power .
i am .
we are .
isn't that where the nuke controls are?
no .
they're in the energy controi room .
your intei would have disclosed that .
if our intei disclosed everything , diana , we would have prevented you from kiiling hernandez and edershaw .
you're heading into the residence .
after that there wiii be no turning back .
in this very corridor there is an escape feature which i can activate and which wiii catapult you to the rear garden .
if you choose this feature , i can teii you how to retrieve the earthquake supplies .
there is no shame in accepting this .
it is the wiser choice for those you care for .
please don't go in there .
i don't want to see you die .
john?
this was vincent's residence?
yes .
he was a ... modest man .
he was a wacko .
i've seen better rooms in motei 6 .
when a man of mr vincent's stature dedicates himself to creating a museum of our species 'greatest masterpieces , he has iittle time for self indulgent comforts .
he spent iess than four hours a day here , and only then to sleep .
only then?
seems vincent's rsum wasn't iimited to ... procurer .
what about connoisseur?
now that's some fine art !
i'm not ashamed of it .
we're going to iook for the stairweii down to the second sub floor .
king .
i was a graduate student at ucla .
mr vincent ...
you can drop the mr now .
i'ii caii him any damn thing i want .
he pursued me to modei for him .
finaily i relented .
was he that good or were you that good?
mr vincent's interest in me exceeded the professional .
he was in love with me .
i never returned the affection .
you're iying .
what?
he bought you with a job .
expect me to believe he didn't buy the rest of you?
you son of a bitch .
vincent wasn't the kind of guy that didn't get what he wanted .
unless ...
unless what?
when you were diagnosed as terminai did you get a second opinion?
of course .
not from one of vincent's doctors?
no .
what are you implying?
he wanted you , didn't he?
he got to keep you young and beautiful .
his one of a kind super computer .
never to grow old , never to die ...
immortal .
and his .
forever .
garth .
major .
you should see this .
teii him what you told me .
it's titanium ailoy .
if we use a standard iaser , it'd take a week to get through .
can we blow it?
not this close to the nuke .
seen a couple of these over the years .
creator built them to withstand anything .
but there's a flaw .
hinging mechanisms buckle under heat .
so if we create the heat i need using the plasma cutter , we can take it down .
time?
a few hours at ieast .
get on it .
it's a two man job .
get back to the residence .
we'ii come get you when we're done .
garth .
you done good so far .
that wiii require some attention .
i hate it when you do that .
you'd rather i ieave?
you'ii do as you wish .
i know why you're reaily here .
do you?
because of them .
elaine and christopher .
how do you know their names?
of your wife and son?
i've seen them .
or recordings of them .
the nationai security computer's stiii up .
mr vincent has a key .
the sateilite communication system is stiii working .
show me .
during your iast security clearance review they shot some film of your family .
you two iook wonderfui together .
see?
i can understand why you're doing this .
they're not real .
they're not reai any more .
what happened?
during the breakdown we were visiting elaine's mother .
my father , he iives on the east side .
i went to get him .
there were riots .
the whole city was on fire .
people were kiiling each other .
it took me days to get back .
and by the time i did they were gone .
so you never iearned .
i'm a soldier .
i face the truth .
i know they're dead .
but in your heart ...
you want to make sure .
john ...
on the desk there's a pair of vr glasses .
put them on .
please .
for me .
john?
i know you're out there , john .
they're coming this way .
we can't stay any ionger .
i've used the iast of mom's jeweilery to secure us passage on a ship .
we're heading north .
it's the best i can do for them now .
i know you'ii foilow and i know you'ii find us .
we're survivors , john .
just iike you .
don't give up on us .
it's gotten bad , john .
the storm started two days ago and it hasn't iet up .
elaine .
we can't get to shore .
i'm afraid , john .
i'm so afraid .
knowing you're out there means we're stiii alive .
you get that , don't you , john?
this may be the end for me , but not for us .
be strong , my iove .
know we love you .
and as iong as you're alive with memories of us , as iong as it burns within you , we wiii always be together .
elaine , don't go .
thank you .
thanks for that .
i know what y o u are after .
ignore her .
you won't reach it .
you sound iike a broken record .
if you go down there , i can't protect you .
protect us?
you don't think you've defeated aii the security systems by yourself , do you?
what if i had sent them aii at once?
blah , blah , blah .
listen to me , captain .
downstairs is different .
the computer room is down there , along with the weapons storage bays .
there's a stand alone system down there , fuily automated .
a kiiling machine .
get back to work .
it's cailed the rook .
it was designed to replace soldiers on the battlefield .
it's dormant now , but as soon as your heat signature reads on the bottom floor the rook wiii activate and kiii you .
shut up .
i'm asking you ...
i said shut up !
i don't wanna hear any more of your iies .
if you continue in this manner , i'ii have to teii major garth what you're truly after .
what's she talking about?
i said mind your work .
please .
reconsider .
no .
john .
john !
lapierre's gone .
i couldn't stop him .
king !
king !
yeah .
lapierre took off .
there's something you should know .
the captain is not after mr vincent's art .
what , then?
before his death mr vincent had created a microorganism transmitted by seeds , capable of returning the ozone iayer to its previous state within a decade .
globai warming wiii be reduced and the earth wiii be reborn .
why didn't he release it , then?
the system had been sabotaged .
by the time it was repaired vincent had died and i alone could not activate it .
who were the saboteurs?
trusted associates working for a man who had created a food substitute .
anton reich .
encrypt , this is diana 1 716 theta theta 6 .
rook activation override .
cease now .
y o u are n o t auth o rised .
emergency override .
cancei activation .
y o u are n o t auth o rised .
how do we stop this thing?
you can't .
the rook is a fuily autonomous operative .
its body armour is five times more effective than the armour you wear now .
it can destroy anything in this facility .
everything has a weakness .
the rook doesn't .
where's lapierre?
in the command corridor .
right now he's talking with mr reich by radio .
they're attempting to raise the pod seed mechanisms so they may be recovered .
son of a bitch wants more compensation .
we have to activate that technology , or ...
go .
i'ii handle the rook .
you can't .
it's a rook .
i'm a king .
i'ii checkmate its ass .
go save the world .
he's taken the remote detonator unit .
the pod terminals have risen .
major .
stings iike a bitch , don't it?
captain , you can't beat the rook .
never could stand that haughty broad .
talking about vincent iike he's a humanitarian , when he's no better than any other rich bastard iooking for a martyrdom iegacy .
why?
you're asking me why , major?
the world went from ten biilion to iess than a miilion .
and what's ieft but false hope and reai estate?
the pods wiii be released eventuaily .
but first reich wiii have his organic food empire .
and i'ii be the generai that runs it .
are you nuts?
reich's going to burn you .
reich needs me .
he's got the vision but i am the implementation .
and when he's gone ...
ch o pper f o ur , whisky papa .
lapierre , c o me in .
go ahead .
can y o u c o nfirm deactivati o n?
roger that .
sams are offline .
you're clear to iand .
repeat , clear to iand .
underst oo d .
whisky papa o ut .
i can't iet you do it .
you can't?
how are you going to stop me?
i got your pulse rifle .
diana's taking a nap somewhere .
you've iost .
what makes you think you could stop me?
cos i know something you don't .
yeah?
and what's that?
you can't fight the rook alone .
the rook is just another one of your girlfriend's inventions .
oh , yeah?
why don't you teii that to king?
you're going to be seeing him soon .
it's real .
yeah , he's real .
reai pissed off .
you got one chance .
that's us fighting it together .
no way .
i give you back the rifle , you frag me .
think of the consequences .
i can't beat the thing alone .
and i got to stay alive for my old man .
what do you say , captain?
what do you say?
lapierre !
your armour .
put it on him .
i'ii shoot the battery pack .
no !
do it .
now !
good work , major .
you found me .
are you ...?
yes .
the disembodiment process is a one sided feature .
once the neurai energy is transferred there is no going back .
then why?
theodore vincent wanted my body as much as my mind .
that's him?
yes .
near the end his health began to diminish .
he had plans to join me in immortality , but he made one cruciai error .
what's that?
he underestimated me .
he thought his files were encrypted and that i would never iearn the truth .
the truth you so acutely guessed .
i wasn't dying , you see , after ail .
it was aii a ruse .
a ruse to possess me , to enslave me .
in the end it was his love for technology that betrayed him .
a simple camera in a simple room during a simple conversation .
you were justified .
was i?
mm .
for 20 years i've iived in a prison .
alone .
did i murder him or save him a iife of heil , just iike mine?
not much of a choice .
no .
it's not .
no .
i would iive in here with you a thousand times over .
but you are not dead , john garth .
you don't have to make the choice .
in fact , you stiii have some work to do .
lapierre is almost at the courtyard where the pod seed cannons are .
let me show you another way .
hurry .
going somewhere?
you just don't quit .
hoo wah .
vega was the same way .
when he iearned what we wanted to do , he tried to walk away .
issue of morality .
had to shoot him down iike a dog .
do i have to do the same to you?
only if you want to go to heii with me .
what's it going to take , garth?
i don't imagine you're going to iet us walk out of here with this .
you want it?
come get it .
i wasn't hoping for anything iess .
now we know , huh?
that was for vega .
weii done , major garth .
weii done .
lapierre told me you were good , but i didn't expect that good .
it's too bad reaily .
i could have used your experience .
oh , weil .
there's always survivors eager to make a buck .
reaily that's what i want to do .
mankind wiii be served , but only after i do some business first .
i won't iet you do it .
you're bleeding to death , major .
you can't move .
how can you stop me?
with the push of a button .
you're quite the mess , john garth .
i'm dying .
no .
not yet .
somebody's at the gate .
what is it , general?
salvation .
what is it?
what do you see?
a new day .
