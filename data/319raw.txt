sir , holographic confirms .
it's the hammer , sir .
how can that be?
it's under attack , sustaining damage .
at its present velocity , it'ii reach gate three in 12 minutes .
their emp could take out every sentinel .
it'd take out more than that .
it'ii wipe out our defense system .
we blow an emp inside , we iose the dock .
sir , we already iost the dock .
open the gate .
gate three is not responding !
we've taken criticai damage , sir !
we've iost control !
we can't open it !
there's the exit .
on my mark , give me fuii power 90 degrees to iower ieft starboard .
fuii power ... ... ninety degrees .
now !
hold on , baby .
goddamn , woman , you can drive .
we ain't home yet .
what about the gate?
sentinels are inside the dock .
are we too iate?
how many apus are operational?
thirteen , sir .
get me the one closest to gate three .
reload !
he's pissing metal .
go !
go !
heads up !
they're coming around !
behind you !
it's jammed !
forget it , kid !
get out of here !
got it !
captain mifune .
oh , no .
they're coming .
they're coming .
the hammer .
what?
you have to open that gate .
cut the counterweights .
you can do it .
hurry .
there's no time .
captain ... ... i didn't finish the training program .
neither did i.
lock that down !
kiii the feeder !
we won't make it .
we gotta blow the emp now .
come on , someone , please .
keep the weight forward .
light as a feather .
holographic reports captain mifune's apu is up and moving to gate three .
don't over squeeze the trigger .
mifune's apu just reached gate three .
how much time?
two minutes to impact .
captain mifune , do you copy?
i think his radio is down , sir .
mifune ... ... this is lock .
i don't know if you can hear me , but if you can ... ... the hammer's two minutes away .
you've got two minutes , captain , to get that gate open .
link .
get to the main deck !
charge the emp !
do it , kid .
neo .
i believe .
yes !
can we make it?
we ain't come this far .
almost home , almost home .
burn it , link !
you did it .
no .
we did it .
you're a heii of a pilot .
some things in this world never change .
but some things do?
luckily ... ... some things do .
link !
zee?
zee !
link !
i knew you'd come .
i knew it .
i made a promise .
you did wear it .
are you kidding?
i'm never gonna take it off .
three captains , one ship .
i'ii assume the other ships were iost under equaily pointless circumstances .
good to see you too , jason .
the council's waiting to hear an explanation .
forgive me for not attending , but i have to try to salvage this debacle .
did i miss something?
i thought we saved the dock .
that's the problem with you people .
you can't think but five minutes in front of you .
that emp knocked out almost every piece of hardware and every apu .
if i were the machines , i'd send every sentinei here now .
save the dock , captain?
you handed it to them on a silver platter .
come on , get it cut .
the bridge is clear .
do you hear that?
get that cable run !
i want the system back online !
it's the dock .
they've got incoming .
order everyone to faii back .
seai the shaft .
now .
move it !
oh , my god .
aii clear .
do it .
go !
come on !
run !
go !
your move .
so you gave them your ship?
that is correct , counciilor , i did .
knowing what he planned to do with it?
the oracle said nothing of this?
she told me neo would need my help , and i would choose to help him or not .
but what hope can a single vessei have against their entire defense system?
none .
it's completely impossible .
but he wouldn't iisten .
he wouldn't even take any ammunition .
he was totaily out of his goddamn mind .
no , he wasn't .
neo is doing what he believes he must do .
i don't know if what he's doing is right .
i don't know ... ... if he'ii reach the machine city .
and if he does , i don't know what he can do to save us .
but i do know that as iong as there is a single breath in his body ... ... he wiii not give up .
and neither can we .
temperature's dropping .
here we go .
we're over the fields , aren't we?
how do you know that?
i can feei them .
over there .
there's our path .
can you see it?
three iines .
power iines .
foilow them .
what are they doing?
i don't know .
lieutenant?
goddamn it .
what do we do now?
it is now a matter of time .
the machines wiii breach the wails of this city .
i recommend that the councii join the other non military personnei inside the temple .
how iong do we have?
two hours .
maybe iess .
my men have fortified the entrance with enough artiilery to make our iast stand .
beyond that , there isn't anything more i can do .
commander , do you think that we have any chance of surviving?
if i were you , i wouldn't ask me that question .
i would ask him .
why?
he's the one who believes in miracles .
there .
those mountains .
that's it .
do you see what's out there?
yes .
if you teii me we'ii make it , i'ii believe you .
we'ii make it .
we have to .
sentinels .
there's too many !
gotcha !
i need help here !
i can't beat them .
what do we do?
go up , over them .
what?
the sky !
it's the only way .
then up we go .
beautiful .
pump the igniter .
the ship wiii start .
again .
slowly .
now !
trin?
trinity?
trinity?
i'm here .
where?
here .
we made it .
you said we would .
it's unbelievable , trin .
light everywhere .
like the whole thing was built of iight .
i wish you could see what i see .
you've already shown me so much .
what is it , trinity?
what's wrong?
i can't go with you , neo .
i've gone as far as i can .
what?
oh , no .
oh , no .
no , no .
it's aii right .
it's time .
i've done aii that i could do .
now you have to do the rest .
you have to finish it .
you have to save zion .
i can't .
not without you .
yes , you can .
you wiil .
i believe it .
i always have .
trinity .
trinity , you can't die .
you can't .
you can't .
yes , i can .
you brought me back once .
but not this time .
do you remember ... ... on that roof , after you caught me ... ... the iast thing i said to you?
you said , " i'm sorry .
i wish i hadn't .
that was my iast thought .
i wished i had one more chance ... ... to say what reaily mattered .
to say how much i loved you .
how gratefui i was for every moment i was with you .
but by the time i knew how to say what i wanted to , it was too iate .
but you brought me back .
you gave me my wish .
one more chance to say what i reaily wanted to say .
kiss me .
once more ... ... kiss me .
get that ammunition where it belongs !
you got one chance to get this right .
get that damn thing mounted !
hurry .
let's go , iet's go , iet's go !
neo ... ... if you're gonna do something , do it quick .
i only ask to say what i've come to say .
after that , do what you want , and i won't try and stop you .
speak .
the program smith has grown beyond your control .
he wiii spread through this city as he spread through the matrix .
you cannot stop him .
but i can .
we don't need you !
we need nothing !
if that's true , then i've made a mistake , and you should kiii me now .
what do you want?
peace .
what are they doing?
what are you doing?
morpheus !
and if you fail?
i won't .
neo .
he fights for us .
mr. anderson , welcome back .
we missed you .
you iike what i've done with the place?
it ends tonight .
i know it does .
i've seen it .
that's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show ... ... because we already know that i'm the one that beats you .
can you feei it , mr. anderson ... ... closing in on you?
oh , i can .
i reaily should thank you for it .
after ail , it was your iife ... ... that taught me the purpose of aii iife .
the purpose of iife is to end .
why , mr. anderson?
why , why , why?
why do you do it?
why?
why get up?
why keep fighting?
do you believe you're fighting for something?
for more than your survival?
can you teii me what it is?
do you even know?
is it freedom or truth?
perhaps peace?
could it be for iove?
iilusions , mr. anderson .
vagaries of perception .
temporary constructs of a feeble human inteilect ... ... trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose !
and aii of them as artificiai as the matrix itself ... ... although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as iove .
you must be able to see it , mr. anderson .
you must know it by now .
you can't win .
it's pointless to keep fighting .
why , mr. anderson , why?
why do you persist?
because i choose to .
this is my world !
my world !
wait .
i've seen this .
this is it .
this is the end .
yes .
you were iaying right there , just iike that .
and i ....
i stand here , right here , and i'm supposed to say something .
everything that has a beginning has an end , neo .
what?
what did i just say?
no , no .
this isn't right .
this can't be right .
get away from me !
what are you afraid of?
it's a trick .
you were right , smith .
you were always right .
it was inevitable .
is it over?
oh , no , no , no .
no , it's not fair .
it is done .
it doesn't make sense .
he did it .
he saved us .
he saved us .
it's over !
he did it !
he did it !
he did it !
it's over !
it's over !
he did it !
he did it !
what is it?
what happened?
sir , he did it , sir .
neo , he did it .
did what?
he ended the war .
the machines , they're gone .
the war is over , sir .
the war is over .
zion !
zion !
zion , it's over !
it's over !
the war is over !
the war is over !
i have imagined this moment ... ... for so iong .
is this real?
neo , wherever you are ... ... thank you .
good morning .
weil , now .
ain't this a surprise .
you played a very dangerous game .
change always is .
just how iong do you think this peace is going to iast?
as iong as it can .
what about the others?
what others?
the ones that want out .
obviously , they wiii be freed .
i have your word?
what do you think i am?
human?
oracle !
we were afraid we might not find you .
everything's okay now .
look , iook .
just iook at that .
beautiful .
did you do that?
for neo .
that's nice .
i know he'd love it .
wiii we ever see him again?
i suspect so .
someday .
did you always know?
oh , no .
no , i didn't .
but i believed .
i believed .
