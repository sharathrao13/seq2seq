of course .
it's the same one who insulted me this morning .
hello .
i'm the mother of the notorious " crossroads killer .
when my son comes home after one of his famous crimes ... his clothes are just filthy .
where are the clothes your son wore ... at the time of the murder?
right here .
sparkling clean .
no trace of blood .
or guts .
unbelievable .
ecce homo .
it's unbelievable .
a group of armed shiites was captured here in madrid today .... according to police sources .
a local shiite spokesman living in madrid ... stated that the commando group was acting on its own ... without any connection to the shiite community .
the same police sources ... promise to release additional information ... within a few hours ... after the interrogations are completed .
oh , my book !
ivan , i have to speak to you .
it's urgent .
leave a message telling me where and when .
i'm going out to look for you now .
bye .
it's me candela .
i've got to see you .
i'm going out .
call me later .
i'm in trouble .
so am l .
good bye .
pepa !
damn it , i need you !
pepa , it's me .
that woman !
pepa , answer .
i'm in big trouble .
from your dad , who doesn't deserve you .
ivan .
what are you doing?
making a phone call .
well , make it !
your mother's too much .
i'm sorry , marisa .
and that slut in the window !
what slut?
where?
weren't you going to use the phone?
why don't you use it?
let's go .
gather everything and let's go .
something's come up that concerns us both .
i must talk to you before you leave .
throw that away !
god , i hope he called .
pepa , it's 5 . : 00a . m.
i'm across from your place , and you're still not home .
i don't know which end is up anymore !
i can't explain over the phone .
what a pest !
i'll tell you one thing
i don't understand , because if you had a problem
you'll feel guilty about this !
it's you .
i called a million times .
you're a drag !
don't say that , or i'll leave .
come on in .
i've been out all night .
so have l .
let's have some coffee .
going somewhere?
no .
ivan's leaving me .
we're doing great .
my life's a mess .
mine too .
problems at work?
no .
i couldn't tell you on the phone .
the phone !
i just ripped it out !
damn !
i'll have to call the phone company .
can i stay here?
i'm in big trouble , pepa !
fix the coffee , then we'll talk .
you're a pain today !
what?
don't call me a pain !
i'm feeling very vulnerable .
my god .
looks like the work of terrorists .
oh , the phone
this just isn't normal .
god , the cops .
i'm dead .
hello .
open up .
we know you're in there .
what do you want?
to see the apartment .
which one?
this one .
why?
to rent it .
the real estate agency sent us .
in that case
come in .
the owner will be back in a minute .
carlos .
yes , honey?
it's too high .
darling , it's a penthouse .
and expensive .
super expensive .
but it's a great location .
i want a real house , and this is not a real house .
the girl is right .
don't call me a girl .
carlos .
yes , my love?
you call this great too?
christ .
pepa is really something .
let's go .
come on .
drop that !
you're a cop , right?
my carlos a cop?
very funny !
i'm no cop .
isn't that your father?
nice people don't touch what is not theirs .
why is this here?
i don't know .
do you know her?
that's pepa .
you know pepa?
not personally , no .
well , here i am .
you know who i am?
did you see the bed?
i think so , ma'am .
you know who i am?
since last night .
but don't call me ma'am .
ivan sent you for his bag?
no , the realtor sent us .
what a coincidence .
i'm glad to meet you anyway .
this is marisa .
who?
oh , hello .
i'm his fiance .
very nice .
i'm his father's ex lover .
pepa , listen
this is candela .
pleased to meet you .
carlos , please .
pardon the mess .
my life's been hectic lately .
can you fix telephones?
i ... can try .
come with me .
this one's out of order ... and i'm expecting a call from your dad .
candela , make some coffee .
we have to go .
yeah .
good idea .
don't be rude .
this is my house .
we've got to talk .
it can't be that urgent !
have you any tools?
yes , in the kitchen .
i'll go get them .
is this any time for repairs?
don't you recognize her?
she was in the phone booth last night .
i hadn't noticed .
if you don't want me here , say so .
who says i don't?
i just learned that my ex lover has a son .
and he's here .
shouldn't he come first?
but i've got a big problem .
okay , we'll talk .
let me know when we're leaving .
it won't take long .
here .
where's ivan?
i don't know .
why doesn't he call?
i need to talk to him .
i don't see him very much .
don't lie .
he's taking a trip with your mom .
my mother thinks he's going with you .
then it's someone else .
so that's why he didn't sleep at his studio !
how do you know?
i spent all night keeping watch .
you must think i'm crazy .
no .
you're just nervous from a lack of sleep .
you didn't know about me?
never .
i had no idea .
ivan never tells me anything .
i just find things out .
last night , when i saw your picture
from your dad , who doesn't deserve you .
ivan .
that's how i knew .
he never says anything , never admits anything ... never criticizes .
do you think i didn't know he was cheating?
sure , but i put up with it .
i tried talking to him civilly , but it didn't work .
so i begged him not to lie about important things ... and to tell me if he stopped loving me .
last week , i finally got him to admit he didn't love me .
it was like pulling teeth .
thanks for listening , since your father wouldn't .
waiting for his call had me ready to choke myself ... with the telephone cord .
so i ripped out the phone .
you did right .
she's gonna jump !
your friend's jumping !
she jumped !
help !
carlos , be careful !
don't let go of me , pepa !
oh , my god !
i can't do it .
come on !
pull !
you could have killed yourself !
that was the idea !
i'm desperate .
so am i , and i don't go jumping off terraces .
young people don't know how to fight for things .
you think life is all pleasure .
well , it isn't .
you have to suffer a lot .
pepa , please .
this isn't the right time .
yes .
i'm sorry .
it's because you scared me .
ivan  yes?
i mean carlos .
bring me my tranquilizers from the kitchen .
i'm in big trouble .
i can see that .
carlos , do you love me?
please , not now .
okay , what's wrong?
three months ago , i spent a weekend with a guy .
i didn't know his name or anything , but after he left ...
i couldn't get him out of my mind .
what happened that weekend?
nothing special .
we fucked the whole weekend .
just thinking about it gives me goose bumps .
it was like a revelation .
like making love for the first time .
i loved it .
sex means a lot at your age .
because his life is always in danger ... he's more intense than other guys .
i knew he'd be back , and i'd agree to anything .
he came back?
two weeks ago ... with two more guys .
you let them all stay?
they were with him .
they took advantage .
wait , wait .
i noticed something weird about them ... and he confessed that they were shiite terrorists .
i flipped .
i really did .
i knew it could be dangerous , but i didn't think about it .
what's worse , they had weapons ... and were planning to attack somewhere .
then i said to him ...
you should have told me about this .
that's when i realized it was a ploy .
he didn't love me .
he used me .
gazpacho .
you didn't call the cops?
delicious .
how could l?
i was a hostage in my own house .
they were arrested yesterday?
yes .
the ones on tv?
i threw out all their stuff ... but if they confess where they were living
if they're tortured , they might tell .
they probably won't tell .
but if they do , the cops will want me for collaborating ... and you for not alerting them .
in my house , i collaborate with whomever i want .
i didn't know where to go .
i couldn't face my folks .
it's bad enough that i became a model .
you need to see a lawyer .
i'll arrange for that .
you can't leave now .
go to paulina morales .
the feminist?
a feminist?
as a woman , she'll take a personal interest .
i'll go change .
then give me her address .
why are men like that?
i really don't understand .
i couldn't stand to be with a man right now .
that's all i needed !
help me !
what happened?
nothing .
she fell asleep .
so suddenly?
the strangest things can happen suddenly .
you should know , candela .
it's true .
but a minute ago
a minute ago she wanted to go home ... but since you ignored her ... she got depressed and had some gazpacho .
that made her fall asleep?
yes .
it was spiked with barbiturates .
sorry .
we could call a doctor .
what kind of barbiturates?
morphidal .
how many?
twenty five or thirty .
she'll have a good sleep .
why did you do that?
were you trying to kill yourself too?
it was for your dad .
he loves gazpacho .
it's no excuse ... but after waiting for hours , i just lost control .
that's what happened to me .
it could happen to anyone .
don't get me wrong .
i didn't want to kill him just to make him stay .
i meant to throw it , but
i understand perfectly .
thanks .
the lawyer's address?
thirty one castellana .
do you mind staying?
the house is so full of women .
i'll stay as long as you like .
thanks .
and fix the phone?
are you okay?
a bit shaken , but
don't let her near the ledge .
see you later .
forget it .
hi , ana .
look what fell down from the sky .
it's mine .
thanks .
it seemed strange just one .
be more careful !
ana was arguing with her boyfriend ... and it almost hit her head .
you again !
hope you don't mind .
thirty one castellana .
i'm glad to see you .
my girlfriend loved the autograph .
when i tell her i saw you again , she'll think we
do you have eye drops?
no .
sorry .
we could buy some .
that's okay .
why didn't i think of eyedrops?
what a dope !
it's working .
forget about them .
but they're hijacking the 10 : 00 p. m. stockholm flight ... and taking it to beirut to free some shiite prisoners .
that flight will be fully booked .
we must report it .
then the cops will get me too !
i'll talk fast so they can't trace the call .
yeah .
you have a way with words .
police precinct .
hello .
tonight's 10 : 00 p. m. flight ... to stockholm ... will be hijacked by shiite terrorists .
thanks .
here we are .
don't tell anyone i cried .
it'll be our secret .
good .
here?
where it says " sign .
is paulina morales in?
she's not seeing anyone this afternoon .
it's urgent .
it won't take long .
come on .
you can arrange it .
okay .
come on .
thanks .
see you later .
wait here .
i'm coming .
can i use the phone?
okay .
is paulina there?
ivan?
i'm going crazy .
stockholm .
you can go in .
of all the nerve !
she said i could come in .
i'm in a hurry .
don't worry .
this won't take long .
may i sit down?
go ahead .
what's the problem?
a friend of mine is in trouble .
a " friend .
she got involved with a shiite terrorist .
i'm dying to smoke .
may l?
the shoe is hers .
anyway , he showed up with two more shiites .
three shiites .
all three just moved in .
now they've been arrested ... and she's scared shitless .
so she needs a lawyer .
why come to me?
you're a feminist .
so?
this is clear cut chauvinism .
i'm going on a trip .
i'll recommend a colleague .
there's not much to be done .
she must turn herself in , go to jail ... and let the jury decide her case .
i don't understand .
she's committed a crime .
her only crime was falling in love and being afraid .
i'd do the same .
i'm sure .
i don't believe this !
and whom were you crying for?
your friend?
not over her .
you see?
aren't you the victim?
yes .
i've also been cheated on .
by a terrorist?
you could say that .
but not a shiite .
he's from madrid .
i don't give advice to the lovelorn .
you're certainly no lawyer , you bitch !
leave , or i'll call the police !
was it helpful?
yes .
i feel much better .
good .
what's this doing here?
a kid brought it and said it's for mr. ivan .
if he wants it , let him come upstairs and show his face !
fine .
do you need some help?
no , i don't !
pepa , i'm here in madrid with you .
that's all i need .
i'm also with you , and i'm so happy to see you write this card .
pepa .
he called?
yeah .
i answered .
well?
give me that !
i shouldn't read your postcards .
never mind .
what did he say?
he's too embarrassed to see you , because ... you know who i am .
how sensitive of him !
i don't want to see him either ... but if he wants his damn suitcase ... he'll have to come and get it !
how are the girls?
fine .
where's candela?
in your room .
did anything happen?
no , no .
did you see the lawyer?
yes .
i'll tell you about it later .
you mind my wearing your dress?
keep it .
it looks nicer on you .
don't lose it again .
my shoes don't fit you .
you saw the lawyer?
yes .
we're taking a trip .
running from the law like two fugitives?
it's best if we take a vacation away from madrid .
i sure need one .
i knew they'd lock me up ... and get you for hiding me .
nothing will happen .
we'll come back in a week .
you'll go to court and tell everything ... except for the fucking , and that'll be that .
really?
don't lie to me .
you know i'm naive .
the lawyer said not to worry .... just to stay in touch with her .
i'm causing so much trouble ... as if you don't have enough of your own .
let's water the plants now .
then we'll pack our bags .
dr. j. pardo .
test results on patient pepa marcos .
christ !
what about the animals?
i don't know .
your stepson was snooping around all day , spying .
it's quite natural , but he won't find much .
relax .
let me do that .
why?
you feel okay?
sure .
you two clean the cage while i water .
poor things .
you're going to miss me .
you're depressed .
just like me .
but you'll come along when i move .
i won't leave you alone .
i'd be a fine one to abandon you .
she's out cold .
let's see .
anyway , who cares?
too bad for her .
poor bunnies !
look .
totally dry .
pepa just has too much on her mind .
did you ever have rabbits?
back home i had many .
i know lots about them .
look how they love turnips .
carlos , i'm sorry i teased you about your stuttering .
sometimes i'm so dumb .
forget it .
but you went a little too far .
you didn't behave properly .
men keep taking advantage of me .
i always realize it when it's too late .
look how the arab world treated me .
i sure didn't deserve that .
this is lucia .
i need to see you .
i can't .
i'm leaving town .
we have to talk .
about something that concerns us both .
if you mean ivan , i'm not interested .
then why are you going away with him?
lady , you're nuts !
between ivan and me , there's nothing but pain .
i'm coming anyway .
i know where you live .
for two days everyone has been saying " no " to me .
now it's my turn to say " no .
i must see ivan before he leaves .
look somewhere else and leave me alone !
that was mom?
yes .
don't be too hard on her .
the way she talks
she's mentally ill .
she threatened to come here .
she shouldn't see you .
and me?
fix marisa some coffee .
we need to talk .
the lawyer didn't work out .
we got into a fight .
she won't defend her?
she'd rather prosecute her .
how'd you meet her?
she was mom's lawyer .
i'm not surprised your mother is sick .
they split up before i was born .
after my birth , she went crazy ... and was placed in a mental institution .
my grandparents raised me .
they wouldn't let ivan see me .
you can look now .
mom was released a year ago .
when she got out , she wanted to go back to ivan ... but he was with you .
can you zip me up?
so she sued him for millions ... for all the time she'd been locked up .
paulina was her lawyer .
your mother doesn't mess around .
paulina tried to sue ivan , but it didn't work .
what an insane story .
mom hates me .
i represent all her years without ivan .
well , i love you .
you're the only good thing ivan ever did .
oh , it's you .
i didn't want to interrupt .
why so dressed up?
i'm going out .
don't mention the lawyer .
what?
see if you can wake up marisa .
and if not?
it's up to you .
anyway , we're leaving .
what?
on a trip .
where?
it's a secret .
we're fugitives .
it's better if you don't know .
but he knows everything .
come on .
what if ivan calls?
tell him i expect nothing from him .
all i have left from him is the suitcase ... and i'm getting rid of it now .
no .
don't say anything .
don't get the phone ... or the door .
fine .
i'll be right back .
i overheard about your mom , and i'm really sorry .
you're a kissing fanatic !
let's give her some coffee .
what's wrong?
nothing .
she's having fun .
i've never seen her like this .
don't wake her .
she's having a great time .
see her face?
she's having a ball .
her face !
look at her lip !
hi .
i've come for my bag .
pepa said it was here .
that's strange .
a kid brought it down earlier ... but when pepa saw it , she threw a fit .
so where's the bag?
she took it and she said ...
if he wants it , let him come and get it ... and show his face !
that's what she said .
she's upstairs now .
i'm in a hurry .
she's probably calmed down ... but you never know .
i'll be back tomorrow .
don't tell her i was here .
sir , i'm a jehovah's witness and cannot tell lies .
only the truth , and nothing but the truth .
but if she doesn't ask
if she asks , i have to tell the gospel truth .
good bye .
i'd like to lie !
the bad thing about my religion is ... that we can't .
i love the sound of the trumpets on judgment day
ivan , i have to speak to you immediately .
leave a message and tell me when and where .
i can't pick up my bag .
i wanted to talk to you ... but i see you're avoiding me .
i'll try again in a few days ... when you're a bit calmer .
i want you to know that our years together ... were the best of my life .
i'm not going away with any woman .
good bye , sweetheart .
i wish you the best with all my heart .
i'm so unhappy
because you no longer love me
why should i try to change your mind
be happy , my love
for i'll never forget the love you gave me
i'm so unhappy
look at him !
he's nuts !
i'll show her , all right !
pepa , you'll pay dearly for those three shiites !
i'm not going away with any women .
good bye , sweetheart .
i wish you the best
liar !
maybe it's true .
he can fool me with everything but his voice .
i know all his intonations .
i worked long enough with him .
goddamn phone !
what were you doing?
that damn fucking bitch !
what did you see in her?
let's get your luggage .
you did it again .
forget it .
calm down !
just look at this place .
the cops !
take it easy .
come on .
it's ivan .
i knew he's no coward .
it's your mother .
let's play .
i can't !
should i let her in?
yes .
read the instructions !
" strategy is
not out loud !
what are you doing here , traitor?
well  carlos , who is it?
i don't know .
it's the police .
what do they want?
we understood .
come on .
right .
shut up or i'll smack you .
good evening .
is she with you?
we met in the elevator .
what's going on?
nothing .
just discussing the lady's dress .
it's awful .
it's just a dress .
but it's awful .
maybe she likes it .
stop acting like a kid in front of the policemen !
i love you , need you , want you .
your ivan .
may i ask why you're here?
a call was made from your telephone ... about some terrorists .
pardon?
someone called from here about the shiite terrorists .
see !
i told you !
those kids !
there's been some mistake .
my phone's been out of order all day .
she just now pulled it out .
i called her 20 minutes ago .
ignore her .
she's a bit crazy .
what am i charged with?
nothing .
we just wanted information about who called .
who ripped out the phone?
i did .
this morning .
so nobody's called from here today .
pepa's some talker !
why?
i was expecting a call .
they didn't call , and i got upset .
who?
ivan?
where is he?
shut up .
i'll ask the questions .
well ... we will .
go ahead .
ask her who ivan is .
who's ivan?
the cause of this mess ... and of the mess your partner's about to see .
he's going to find marisa .
all right .
explain .
may i sit down?
if i'm to bare my soul , i'd rather be comfortable .
i've had a hard day .
are you comfortable?
i'd be more comfortable alone with my friends ... playing strategy .
you can't always have everything .
we agree on that .
who is this ivan?
he was my lover .
before that he was with her .
he's my son's father .
him?
what's he doing here?
he came to rent my apartment .
i didn't know .
i get the feeling you're pulling my leg .
you think i like baring my soul to strangers?
well , you're wrong .
it's humiliating .
damn it , mom !
candela , get me a drink .
what kind?
there's gazpacho .
right !
gazpacho !
let's go .
where are you going?
for gazpacho .
want some?
we're on duty , but we don't want to be rude
gazpacho for everyone .
is she sleeping?
like a log .
she's carlos 'fiance .
she was tired .
you want me to wake her up?
not yet .
why don't you sit down?
i'm getting a stiff neck .
we have nothing against you
thanks a lot .
without being inquisitive ... you must admit this is a little weird .
a charred bedroom ... a broken phone , a smashed window
it's been weird , all right .
okay .
start at the beginning .
and make it clear , concise , and fair .
i don't know if i can .
i'm too hurt to be clear , concise , and fair .
words !
just the facts .
okay .
i lived here ... with ivan .
we loved each other .
at least , i loved him .
after months of trying to keep our love together ... we split up a week ago .
he told me to pack his bags .
he'd be taking a trip ... with another woman .
he said that?
he never travels alone .
remember , these two for the cops .
an extra dose .
careful .
this is too warm .
carlos , my god !
in front of your mother , the cops , your fiance !
aren't you afraid?
go on , please .
so i packed up his stuff and went to work .
when i came back , the house was like this .
except for the phone , which i did .
the suitcase was gone ... and the bed was all burned .
they're taking very long .
go .
check .
they're probably kissing .
what about marisa?
she'd better wake up .
takes after his father .
now , who's that?
yeah?
telephone repair .
and you?
police .
your i. d.?
and yours?
are you the lady who called this morning?
yes .
here's the phone , and here's the plug .
i reached her here by phone 20 minutes ago .
there she goes again !
not on this phone .
let's get to the point .
do you know any shiite terrorists?
shut up !
he's asking her !
i didn't know madrid had any .
do you know them?
not me .
i'm not into politics .
sure , man .
they were on tv today !
shut up !
you want the tv on?
i'm not interested in shiites .
ma'am , what about you?
pepa and i have important things to discuss .
men , right?
what's more important?
fine .
we'll talk about men .
is ivan involved with these terrorists?
relax .
ivan?
i don't know .
he's hidden so many things from me .
can you give me his address ... or phone number?
he has no phone .
and he's not home .
i told you he's leaving town .
try the airport .
the airport?
where's he going?
where is he going?
to stockholm ... tonight .
with paulina morales .
stockholm !
why didn't you say so before?
because i just figured it out .
now i understand it all
the phone call .
what an idiot i am !
why didn't i see it before?
your lawyer played it beautifully .
you didn't know they'd be hijacking that flight?
the shiites?
the whole country knows .
it was on tv .
but the tip came from this phone .
i want to know who the hell called ... or i'll haul you all in !
why aren't you at the airport?
there are more cops there than passengers .
i don't know what's going on ... but if you don't start talking
chief , this stuff has been spiked .
what's in the gazpacho?
tomatoes , cucumbers ... bell pepper , onion ... one garlic clove ... oil , salt , vinegar ... some day old bread , and water .
the secret's in mixing it right .
ivan loves the way i mix it .
i made it for him .
you collect weapons?
get back !
move back .
i don't want to hurt the kids .
is ivan really going to stockholm?
it's just a hunch , but i'm pretty sure .
what did you have to tell him?
nothing , now .
i just want to forget him .
and you should do the same .
in the hospital , i had forgotten him .
i didn't remember anything .
until suddenly ... one night , i heard his voice on tv .
i didn't recognize his face ... just his voice .
he was telling a woman he loved her .
i felt a spasm inside me .
i remembered all the times he's said that to me .
i regained my sanity and my memory .
from that moment on ...
i acted as if i had been cured ... and they released me .
if you're cured , stop aiming at me .
but i'm not cured .
i faked it , and i fooled them .
i can only forget him by killing him .
how will you do that?
at the airport .
the airport is full of cops .
you heard him .
i'll manage .
now that you know
let's drink a toast .
drink !
you too .
oh , my eyes !
my eyes !
she left the door open !
the door !
take me to the airport , please .
sorry .
i have a date .
take me !
what the hell is that?
a gun .
let's go .
my girlfriend will be mad .
not as mad as i'll be .
quick , to stockholm !
right under my nose !
did you see that?
come on .
after them !
you again !
great !
we're meant for each other !
whom do we follow today?
that motorcycle !
that harley !
i'll do my best .
to the airport !
blow on my eyes .
that lady is crazy , and she carries two guns .
why did she take ambite?
because she's in a hurry .
ah !
eye drops !
anything else , ladies?
no .
just step on it .
that lady is dangerous .
no lady's dangerous if you know how to handle her .
there they are .
i've got them .
i can't see .
he can never say " no .
ana , that lady has two guns , and she's a nut .
look what she did to me !
you think i go around like this for fun?
she's capable of anything !
my ass is the only one allowed on that bike .
i'm fed up .
i'm gonna get myself some quick cash ... buy myself his bike and split .
with a bike ... who needs a man?
learning mechanics is easier than learning male psychology .
you can figure out a bike ... but you can never figure out a man .
she's going for his balls !
i think she's just trying to hang on .
fresh out of the mental ward ... and she looks like a professional biker .
be careful !
she's crazy !
and she has a gun !
bitch !
get down !
shut up , idiot women !
leave my man alone !
can't you go any faster?
lady , this thing is a relic .
a relic?
just remember this gun !
okay !
don't shoot !
don't you sell guns?
i don't need them .
what if you're held up?
i avoid danger , just like now .
sorry , ladies .
the chase is over .
please , just take us to the airport somehow .
i'm a taxi driver , not a bounty hunter .
i warned you she was a dangerous woman .
he said he could deal .
right here .
thanks .
stockholm , please?
international flights are over there .
you're weak , ivan .
yes , sweetheart .
don't agree with me !
but you're right .
sometimes i like to be wrong .
take me back to the hospital .
that's my home .
are you all right?
let go .
you saved my life , darling .
don't worry .
i don't want anything in return .
just one thing .
tell her to go away !
go away !
pepa , i'm ashamed .
i've treated you so badly .
all i wanted was to talk to you .
i've spent two days waiting ...
looking for you , leaving messages .
we can talk tonight .
the trip to stockholm can wait .
no .
it's too late now .
don't hold a grudge .
let's have a drink , now , in the cafeteria .
yesterday ... this morning , or even at noon today ... we could have .
but now it's too late .
it's been too late for the past two hours .
then why did you come out here?
lucia wanted to kill you ... and i came to stop her .
since you're out of danger , i'm leaving .
good bye .
home at last !
the visitors ... are comfortable .
and the kids?
candela really manages to recover quickly .
hope he's luckier for her than the shiites were .
god , what a mess !
the maid comes tomorrow .
better wear shoes with this mess .
i wonder which is better ... slipping on gazpacho , or cutting myself on the glass .
the repairman is a doll , but i'd better save him for marisa .
i fell asleep .
how do you feel?
like new .
but you don't look so hot .
well ...
i'm going to have a baby .
i didn't know .
you're the first person i've told .
congratulations !
you should sit here .
i'll explain tomorrow .
but  sit down .
you just woke up , but i haven't slept in two days .
i won't sublet it .
i love the view .
yeah , it's gorgeous .
how long was i asleep?
hours !
you have beautiful skin .
i had a dream .
a good one?
i think so .
i was a virgin this morning ... but i don't think i am now .
don't tell me one of these jerks  no .
it was in my dream !
great !
actually , you've lost ... that hard look that virgins have .
virgins are awful .
if you were on stage faking a cheap pain
don't bother to act
i know that play
liar
how well you fit that part
it would seem after all
that's the way you are
i was blinded
by your passionate kisses
you lied coldly
but the curtain finally came down
playacting
that's what you do best
a finely rehearsed lie
a well turned mockery
you outdid yourself
destroying my heart
and now that your tears are for real
i only remember your lies
forgive me if i don't believe you
but i think you're putting on a show
don't forget that after all
i'm supposed to be in the wrong
playacting
that's what you do best
a finely rehearsed lie
a well turned mockery
you outdid yourself
destroying my heart
