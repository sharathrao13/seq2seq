it's not there yet ...
it doesn't have ... the feeling .
okay ...
the second half is too slow?
yeah , that's right .
how about the graphics?
oh , they're great .
yes !
62 percent .
not even " amateur " .
aw , shut up !
ow !
okay , the hospital sequence ...
nami , 16 .
mother , don't die !
don't leave me alone !
forgive me ... please ...
what?
what did you say?
saint ...
john's ... wort .
nami , 20 .
and the certified copy of your census register?
here it is .
well , that's it , then .
thank you .
i never knew ... about my mother and father .
well , let's get down to business .
the last will and testament of your father ... the late kaizawa soichi .
the land , house and its contents in their entirety ... are left to you .
it's nami .
ready to quit school and work here?
shinichi !
don't rush her !
oh ... thanks for these .
they help a lot .
i can't draw this kind of stuff .
i love nami's illustrations .
they're so soft and gentle .
i guess it's because she goes to art school .
kohei?
yes ...
he's upstairs , in the president's office .
is it time already?
sorry !
it's okay .
i slept a bit .
i mean about my asking you to do this .
it's okay .
we haven't gone driving for a while .
good work .
we'll be back tonight .
what's this?
a date?
no !
nami and i are history .
so what's going on?
material .
ideas we can use in the next game .
you mean the old mansion she inherited?
you know , i've been thinking ...
why was i abandoned?
you weren't " abandoned " ...
yes , i was !
didn't your mother die when you were born?
your father couldn't have raised you alone .
who's living there now?
no one !
the lawyer said a caretaker lives nearby .
hello? ls shinichi there?
no?
well , when he gets back , tell him we've arrived .
yeah , okay !
so this is where you were born ...
do you remember it?
of course not !
i left when i was two or three .
that's why you can't remember .
but when i was a kid i'd have this dream ...
yeah?
there was a room with a portrait of a king , and a big staircase .
i'd be standing in front of the picture looking at it .
a big staircase ...
there might be one like it here .
i've been waiting for you .
i've been the caretaker here for 20 years ... but you are its first visitors .
miss , your late father wanted so mush to meet you .
well , here is the key .
if you need anything , please call me .
make yourself at home .
look at this place !
that's st john's wort .
those were my mother's last words !
the aunt who raised you?
what?
remember how each flower means something in old poetry?
well , " st. john's wort " ... stand for " revenge " .
revenge "?
only in very old poems .
come on .
it's huge !
hey ...
isn't this what you were talking about?
the staircase in your dream?
oh , that ...
no .
this isn't it .
oh !
i see .
a kaizawa soichi !
and that one !
that one , too !
wow !
fantastic !
you know him?
i never told you?
in high school i thought he was great !
i heard he died in an accident a while back ...
was kaizawa soichi your father?
yeah !
but i never knew he was a painter .
wow ! lsn't that amazing !
he was better known abroad than he was in japan .
it won't fit?
we'll ask the caretaker about it later .
is there a studio?
there must be .
this is kaizawa soichi's house !
but there's a lot about him no one's sure of .
one story says he went abroad in his teens .
they say he was a recluse ... who only ever saw his dealer .
look !
up there !
that's the only portrait of him .
a portrait?
so that's my real father?
kaizawa soichi ...
at least now we understand one thing .
where you get your talent .
you're his daughter , for sure .
what's the next room?
amazing !
kaizawa soichi !
what is it?
hey ...
do you think that might be your mother?
look !
see?
wow ! lncredible !
look at them all !
wow !
look at this !
what about it?
maybe it was yours .
these are pretty shocking .
i guess there're hidden meanings beneath them .
what?
what's this?
hey , here's another cane ...
the last room .
okay ...
a bedroom ...
your dad's shirts?
it won't work .
what's in here?
does it open?
a music box ...
babies ...
nami , naomi " ...
is that me?
maybe you had a twin !
who's " naomi "?
your twin , maybe .
no way !
i wonder if i'm the older or the younger ...
your name's written first ...
so i'm older?
guess so !
how does it feel?
hey ...
what was that?
what?
didn't you hear it?
no .
i heard something !
like a little girl's voice .
nope !
there it is again !
i can't hear it .
it came from over there .
bull !
it did !
i heard it !
let's check the video .
guess so !
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
there !
i heard it !
you did?
yes !
i don't know ...
it was a little girl .
maybe you just heard it because you believe there's a voice .
you're wrong !
i heard it .
but there's no one here .
but ...
that was a surprise !
what happened?
what happened? !
nami , it's a key !
maybe for that room you tried to go into ...
what?
it's blank .
kohei ...
keys !
yeah !
but to where?
there's no more rooms .
oh shit !
the battery's dead .
bye " .
where were you?
you're going?
yep .
good night !

what are you doing?
i was going to use this to make a map .

toko's making a map !
nothing?
there must be a notebook or something ...
hey , here's a door !
here !
those keys ...
his studio ...
woman with eyes of flame " ...
could it be?
kaizawa soichi's great lost masterpiece ...

it doesn't look like it's finished .
an unfinished masterpiece ...

the map's finished !
shinichi , wake up !
i've got the map done !

nami !
nami !
what the hell are you doing?
nami !
nami !
nami !
wake up !
that suits you !
it was probably my mother's .
yeah , maybe !
nami ...
do you think maybe we could start over again?
it wouldn't work .
why not?
sure , it's fine right now ... but when you get busy , it'll be just like it was .
okay ...
then ...
iet's say if today goes well , we continue tomorrow .
and if tomorrow's good , then the next day .
we'll take it one day at a time .
there's that voice again !
don't leave me alone !
who is it? !
shit !
that caretaker !
the guy i fought ... had marks on his wrist .
what? !
mail from shinichi .
a strange room "?
another room !
so ... is that where the caretaker is?
i'm going in there .
he might know about my father ... and about naomi .
but you're safe here !
but i want to know !
i don't know who i am .
or what i am .
when i heard of my real family line .
i just can't believe it .
why?
why did they abandon me?
i want to find all that out .
i want to know who i am .
kohei !
what's this?
he's been watching us !
kohei?
are you okay?
yeah , more or less .
the map helped .
we're where you told us .
the damn caretaker was watching us from here .
it's all computerized .
i'll send you its data .
why?
what?
because i'm going to go and find that caretaker .
i'll send the old files from the hard drive , too .
i'll need help on this .
right !
kohei's so amazing !
i'll help from over there .
right !
hello?
look at the monitor file !
which one?
for the kitchen .
compare it with your footage .
the kitchen?
okay !
what's that?
the caretaker ...
more mummies?
yeah .
six of them .
all young children .
other kids ... besides naomi?
toko !
check the papers !
what about the caretaker?
we'll leave him .
the police can handle that .
okay !
stay with nami !
right !
later " .
i wonder if these are paintings of those kids ...
don't say that !
hello?
well?
i've just sent you back a video file .
what's on it?
kaizawa soichi's secret .
it's pretty bad .
why don't you go upstairs?
get some sleep !
why?
when the police get here tomorrow , things are going to get busy .
no !
i've still got things to do .
work again?
yeah !
different things .
it's okay !
i can see you .
if anything happens i'll come .
i knew this wouldn't work .
you never change .
we didn't even last through one night .
shinichi ... where's that file?
i wonder if these are paintings of those kids ...
you're his daughter , for sure .
i'm sending his paintings .
toko .
what'll i tell nami?
i'll erase all this .
not so fast .
it'll be evidence .
what?
didn't you see something?
where?
the hall upstairs .
i don't see a thing .
i thought i saw something moving .
i'm done .
hello?
it's toko .
i did a newspaper search .
there've been seven kids disappear there , over the last dozen years .
seven?
you're sure it's not six?
no , seven .
it fits if you include the one in the studio .
but that was ...
maybe that isn't naomi .
the papers say it was all boys that disappeared .
i checked it with the police lists , too .
there's yellow flowers in this picture , too .
and this one .
yellow flowers ...
that one , too !
is that st. john's wort?
the papers say it was all boys that disappeared .
she's growing !
i didn't want you to see .
i don't know what to say .
your ...
naomi !
naomi !
wait !
but when i was a kid i'd have these dreams ...
there was a room with a portrait of a king ... and a big staircase .
i'd be standing in front of the picture looking at it .
are you naomi?
my younger sister?
i drew those !
why?
naomi ...
nami ...
i'm ... your twin ... brother .
when they took you away ...
i waited and waited for you to come back .
don't leave me alone !
but ... you forgot me .
you were happy growing up not knowing anything about me !
why should i be the only one to suffer , i wondered .
i hated you .
i wanted to make you as scared as i'd always been .
and i did .
but the fear that you've felt ... is only a millionth of what i have !
i was terrified of father .
all my life !
but when he died , i realized ... only he could have painted what he did .
his love was in them .
i was happy i'd been the model for his painting .
all of those pictures ... are of me ... proof that i existed .
nami ... will you do me a favor?
i know you will .
i want you to finish this picture , in father's place .
me?
that picture?
yes !
paint me ... with eyes of flame .
we're the only ones who can understand him .
you can do it .
it's his blood that flows in you .
father always treasured ... these pictures .
you were here ... together with us ... always .
nami ... you'll do it , won't you .
nami ... hurry !
nami !
father !
father !
well?
it's kind of mean to nami ...
it's fine as an ending .
i think it's a bit harsh .
well , let's see mine .
kohei !
what happened? !
it's naomi !
she's alive !
naomi?
is there another room?
i'm looking !
there's no time !
kohei !
kohei !
nami !
yeah?
kohei , are you okay?
i've found them !
where?
go upstairs ...
where?
hall ...
shinichi !
nami !
nami !
answer me !
nami !
nami !
let go of me !
let go !
naomi ... !
naomi !
naomi !
naomi !
wow !
nami , that's great !
i didn't do that last part !
