johan became a multimillionaire in his old age .
an old danish aunt ... who had been a renowned opera singer ...
left him a fortune .
once he became financially independent , he left the university .
he bought his grandparents 'summer house .
a run down chalet in an isolated area near orsa .
johan and i haven't had any contact with each other for many years .
our daughters are far away , even from me .
martha lives in a home , sinking in the isolation of her illness .
i visit her now and then , but she doesn't recognize me .
and sarah ...
sarah married a successful lawyer ... and then moved to australia where they have very good jobs .
they don't have any children .
me?
i still practice my profession , but at the pace i choose .
family quarrels and divorces mostly .
i've been thinking i should visit johan .
one marianne carries out her plan
i've been thinking ...
i should visit johan .
and now i'm here .
he's sitting there , at the porch .
and i've been standing here , watching him and ... waiting , at least ten minutes .
maybe i should have ignored this irrational impulse .
this trip .
in fact , i'm not an impulsive person at all .
but here i am ...
slowly return to my car ... or get close to him .
of course , i could stay here a while longer ... and let my confusion abate .
but not very long .
a minute more !
this minute is taking its time .
33 seconds ...
47 seconds ...
55 seconds ...
no !
did i wake you?
it's you , marianne .
hi !
no , don't get up .
typical , you were spying on me .
that's not true .
we haven't seen each other in 30 years .
32 years !
we simply lost track of each other .
that's natural .
people start together , then they separate and talk by phone ...
and finally silence .
so sad !  was that a reproach?
no , we had nothing to say to each other .
then suddenly you call me and tell me you want to visit .
you didn't sound very keen .
keen?
i said no .
i still say no .
i don't want this .
no .
but you don't care .
i had to come .
why?
i won't tell you .
you're laughing .
johan ...
i've driven 340 km .... and managed to find your hideout ... in the middle of the jungle .
now that i've seen and kissed you and we've spoken i can leave .
that won't be enough .
really?
at least you can stay over for dinner .
why?
a week ago , i told mrs. nilsson ... that my ex wife was coming to visit .
i can't tell her suddenly that there'll be no dinner .
she'll go crazy .
who's mrs. nilsson?
agda .
agda nilsson .
are you and her a couple?
god forbid !
the two of you live all alone here in the midst of a dark forest?
mrs. nilsson lives in the village .
she cleans and cooks and then goes home .
she's religious and mean .
there's no romance then .
to be honest , i fear the hag .
i fear that she might want to marry me .
anyway , stay for dinner .
she's made up the guest room , so you have to stay and spend the night .
i suppose i better accept .
it's so hard to get up from this chair .
no , don't help me .
what's wrong , johan?
i'm trying to put my arms around you .
want to hug me?
damn , johan !
old idiot !
and how old are you?
i don't know , and you?
86 .
no , not you , me !
around 55 .
i'm 63 .
really?
that many?
and i've had my uterus and ovaries removed .
does that trouble you?
yes , sometimes .
let's sit on the bench .
it's so beautiful !
when beauty is revealed ... in life , in creation ...
where is the source , the giver?
beauty forever .
i didn't know you knew some psalms .
my grandmother taught me .
and my grandfather rewarded me with little iron soldiers .
we can enjoy the view ,
hold hands ...
are we going to hold hands?
didn't we used to do it?
yes , i believe so .
i haven't done it since ...
i've stopped doing it .
you really have a beautiful view .
can you see the lake house from here?
you can see the light reflected , behind the rocks .
i drove by the lake house coming here .
it looks inhabited .
you could say that .
henrik is there .
yes , henrik .
mi dear son .
the assistant professor .
are you on speaking terms?
not exactly .
i got a brief letter declaring that he was planning on moving there .
he and his daughter karin have been there since late april .
you don't have much contact then .
absolutely .
a cordial conversation if we run across each other .
fat boy henrik !
he must be ... 61 !
my god !
you can say that again !
and his daughter karin?
karin is 19 .
her mother died of cancer two years ago .
anna ...
tell me .
anna and henrik were married for 20 years .
he couldn't take her death .
he retired before his time .
i heard they were happy to get rid of him .
he felt mistreated there .
like you , at that age .
me?
no ...
well , yes , i was a bit fed up with the academic standards silliness .
my honorary doctorate from the university of michigan ... finished all that .
we were talking about henrik .
he directs an orchestra called " uppsala chamber soloists " .
but he'll quit that also .
he must do something .
i think he's writing a book .
what about the daughter?
karin?
karin also plays the cello .
she'll audition for the conservatory in the fall .
henrik is teaching her .
they sit in the house with their cellos every day .
you could say she's beautiful .
like her mother .
yes .
so ... i know nothing about our daughters .
sarah is in australia .
australia? !
yes , australia .
well , she managed to get far away .
i get letters and phone calls from her .
she's fine .
a good law firm .
a good husband .
sarah's happy with her life .
and poor martha?
martha's sinking further and further .
she didn't recognize me .
she's no longer aware , in our sense , of the world .
i understand ...
and you?
i can't complain .
though sometimes , i see myself in voluntary isolation ... and i think i'm in hell .
like i'm dead , but i don't know about it .
but i'm fine .
i've plagiarized my past now that i have the page of answers .
doesn't sound like fun .
that's it , marianne .
it's not .
and who the hell said that damnation would be fun?
what does your " page of answers say "?
want to know?
i asked the question , didn't i?
it says my life was shit .
a stupid and totally senseless life .
is our marriage part of your hell?
to be honest , yes .
i'm sorry to hear that .
a good relationship has two elements : a good friendship and an unshakeable eroticism " .
nobody can say that we weren't good friends .
good friends .
of course .
you were unfaithful .
i ...
i was too .
it's so sad .
but it was long ago .
it's still painful .
not for me .
no , i suppose not .
dearest marianne .
that's what you say .
yes , it's what i say .
it's nice to be here with you .
holding hands , watching the beautiful view .
without talking about painful things .
you're holding my hand .
dinner !
mrs. nilsson will be furious if we're late .
johan , i need to wash up and get my bag from the car .
this was a mistake !
two nearly a week has passed
are you karin?
do you want to speak to your grandfather?
your grandfather and mrs. nilsson went to the dentist .
i'm marianne .
i was your granddad s wife .
i'm visiting .
i know .
come on , sit down .
if you want , you can help me clean out these mushrooms .
here's a knife .
if you want to talk , we'll talk .
if not , we can just be together .
you must know henrik , my dad .
can't say i do .
i've just greeted him , but i don't know him .
mom is dead .
i know .
she died two years ago .
your granddad told me .
dad retired and is spending his time with music now .
the cello , right?
he's writing about st john's passion .
you also play the cello?
i hope to get into the conservatory .
your father is the teacher and you are the student .
yes .
what's wrong?
do you know hindemith's cello sonata , opus 25?
i don't know anything about music .
dad wants me to play it for the audition .
it's too hard !
and doesn't he think so?
how were you in the days before your period?
a premenstrual monster .
i would go to sleep as an angel , and wake up as a demon .
my mind gets shattered .
and it's very hard for me to get up .
dad is a morning person .
and i yawned .
we were working on the fourth movement .
lebhafte viertel ohne jeden audsdruck und stets pianissimo
you know?
it looks difficult anyhow .
so i sat there with my shattered mind and i tried .
i begged him to let me off the hook , to no avail .
he made me play the same part at least twenty times !
i don't give a damn about this " .
i said that it wasn't a class , it was animal torture .
lebhaft , sehr markiert ... mit festen bogenstrichen .
i was so angry that i couldn't .
he said i was doing it on purpose .
i was unfair .
dad is the most patient , sensitive and courteous teacher there is .
he said it had nothing to do with the teaching , but rather with willpower and discipline ... and that i was lazy .
that i was lazy !
then i got up and left the cello because i was trembling .
i said that it was enough for the day and that i was going out for a walk .
he turned pale .
i'd never seen him like that .
you're not leaving " .
i put my boots on and headed for the door .
i didn't hear him approach , but he grabbed me by the shoulders ...
you're not leaving !
you're not leaving !
i sat and cried .
never again , never again , ... never again " .
and kept crying until i felt empty .
then i thought of coming over to see granddad and begging him to help me ...
leave that lunatic .
it was too much for me .
now the old man can take care of his crazy son : send him to the farm , go to the police ... or kill him .
then i became aware that from now on , i know nothing .
i know nothing about my life , what i'll do or become .
then i realized that mom is dead , and i can't ask her anything .
i was overcome with sorrow for myself and cried again .
you must think i'm a very nervous person , but i'm not .
do you think henrik is suicidal?
if he'd kill himself?
in an extreme situation like the one you're describing ... could he hurt himself?
you know , to be honest , i don't know my father very well .
i only know that deep inside he's ... good .
if not , mom never ...
mom loved him , you know?
they loved each other .
and i suppose i was out of that love .
that's what i think when i'm feeling sorry for myself and i get tired of my boyfriends .
why can't i feel love like mom did?
were you afraid your dad would kill himself after her death?
i never gave his tragedy much thought .
but i tried to take care of mom , as much as he'd let me .
mom was never very talkative .
but on one of her last days ...
she was always drowsy from the morphine ...
you know i love you " .
you know i love you , karin " .
my mother never spoke that way .
dad once said as a joke , this was a long time ago ,
anna never says i love you , but her actions are always full of love " .
what if grandfather comes back?
it's ok , i've got another bottle .
were you really married to grandpa?
is that so strange?
it's hard to imagine it .
what kind of person is he?
good question .
did you love him?
i've asked myself the same question all my life .
was he so difficult?
we were married for 16 years .
then we got divorced .
he had met another woman , an idiot named paula .
i got married again to a boring glider pilot .
one day , he just flew away .
they never found him .
for some reason , johan and i got together several times .
then i found out he was servicing ... another lady , a real whore .
i was angry and hurt and finished with him .
i suddenly realized , that i was the most cheated on wife and lover in the world .
johan was remarkably and compulsively unfaithful .
you mean that my grand father ... was a real liar .
and he used to write poems .
a volume got published , but it wasn't successful .
my grandfather used to write verses?
yes , even love poems for me .
did you keep them?
no .
but did you love him?
i was terribly naive .
nowadays , i suppose it's just not possible to be so , so childish ... and so know it all like i was .
i think i loved him .
utterly .
you never suspected?
not for an instant .
what made you come here suddenly?
i don't know .
you still love him !
don't you?
if you had to be honest , marianne ...
i hear people say johan is this or that , not very kind things usually .
but i don't know the johan they're talking about .
i always thought he was a good man .
very , very good .
it was so easy to hurt him , he could never defend himself .
i believe that johan ... is a moving person .
he's moving .
are you crying?
yes , a little .
are you crying for granddad?
i'm crying for johan and marianne .
i understand .
this is strange .
dear ...
what will you do?
return to henrik .
is that intelligent?
it has nothing to do with that .
i'll stay here a few more days .
let me know what happens .
i will .
three about anna
it can't happen again .
never again .
never .
we must have a serious talk .
we both know how things are .
there's nothing to sort out .
i'm glad it's so simple !
i was scared to death .
i was scared to death .
do you understand?
i'm very tired .
i'm going to sleep .
are you asleep?
no .
once i had a similar situation with anna .
we weren't married yet , but we lived together .
maybe i was a little drunk .
i said nasty things about ... the damned university , my colleagues , our work environment .
and then about my father , that old bastard .
anna didn't say a word .
and that upset me even more .
i remember thinking ...
what's on anna's mind , while she's sewing that skirt?
what's she thinking?
maybe that henrik is unbearable " .
and then she said it .
when you're like this ,
i start thinking that you're not the man i planned to marry " .
then she went to the living room and started to pack .
i tried to stop her .
she didn't move ... but a message got through from her body to mine .
it said " i'm leaving ...
i'm leaving you " .
nobody leaves me " .
nobody leaves me
nobody turns his back on me and leaves ... " .
it's over " .
anna's leaving and she won't return " .
but then i heard her going around the kitchen .
she was making coffee .
but she didn't say a word .
maybe she wanted to sober me up .
she didn't say anything for the rest of the evening : just kept on sewing .
anna was the silent type anyway , she never spoke much .
but we didn't need to speak ; we always knew ...
i begged her to forgive me .
i won't do it again " .
it's just what i want to say to you , but it sounds ridiculous .
anyone can say " i'm sorry " , but it's meaningless .
so no further words were spoken that night .
it became a ... distant night .
i stayed awake listening to her breathing .
i watched her , a street light shone through the window .
i gazed at her for a long time and wondered if she really knew ... how much i loved her .
between anna and me it was a question of belonging , if you know what i mean .
an ownership that was ... a miracle .
i know it sounds fatuous .
there's no better word .
i fell asleep as dawn approached , and when the alarm clock rang , we got up , had breakfast and chatted as usual .
i went to a class and anna went to the library .
this is an explanation : not an excuse .
i have no excuses .
if you leave me ...
i il be ruined , or some other word that doesn't exist .
in due time , you'll have your freedom .
you'll go to the conservatory ...
with professional teachers and a different life .
it'll be different for me also .
these months with you have been " a state of grace " .
for me , that is , not for you .
it was kind of you to return so soon .
i don't know what to say .
it's all so complicated .
we don't have to speak about that .
sometimes i feel a great punishment awaits me .
four
about a week later , henrik visits his father .
kierkegaard , s.
or a fragment of life
am i interrupting?
oh , so it's you .
it's been a long time .
how are you?
well , thank you , and you?
at 60 there's 6 things wrong with you , at 70 , 7 and so on .
of course , it depends on your priorities .
i heard about your ex wife's unexpected visit .
typical marianne .
she's always known i hate improvisation .
maybe i can see her .
she's gathering strawberries .
i don't know if you'll be here when she returns .
i don't mean to disturb you .
thanks for being considerate .
what do you want?
i need 890, 000 kroner .
an advance on my inheritance .
you need money again .
i know , i owe you 200, 000 .
that you haven't even begun to pay back .
don't worry , i'll pay it back .
i'm sure i'll never see that money again .
it's funny to consider it a " loan " .
if humiliating me amuses you , let's not forget ...
i'm not paying rent on the lake house .
we've been there for five months and you haven't seen a cent .
but you were able to buy a new car .
it's a loan .
the owner is away .
when he returns in october , i'll be without a car .
how's the book going?
well , thank you .
that's a thorough answer .
i've been here ten minutes , letting you humiliate me .
if i didn't need the money , i'd have left long ago .
you can leave now .
it's not for me .
it's for karin .
i see ...
marianne told me you two argued .
are you trying to make her stay?
do you think she'll accept a bribe?
i wonder how anna was able to stand you .
don't bring anna into this .
don't you dare mention anna with that mouth .
i like you more or dislike you less when you use that tone .
there's a healthy dose of hate in your banalities .
there's a cello i can buy karin ; an 1815 fagnola .
it's an excellent instrument , almost like a guarneri .
karin has a special talent , she could become a great musician .
i took care of her instruction , but her talent calls for more .
like her cello .
her german cello is passable , but she'll audition for the conservatory .
are you sure it's good?
it wouldn't be the first time they fool you .
it has an authenticity certificate
and the seller is decent .
is that why it's so cheap?
he's old and sick and can't take care of it any more .
he said it's perfect for her .
how touching .
dad , where does all this hostility come from?
speak for yourself .
when you were 18 or 19 i tried to approach you .
you had been very ill and your mother wanted us to talk .
i told you i knew i had been a bad father , but i wanted to make it better .
and you screamed .
bad father? !
you never were a father !
then you said you could do without my help .
honest hate must be respected ; i respect it .
but i couldn't care less if you hate me .
you hardly exist .
if it wasn't for karin , who thank god is like her mother , you wouldn't exist at all for me .
there's no hostility here , i swear .
give me the name and number of the cello owner and i'll see .
here you are .
thank you .
what's your answer?
i'll let you know .
can i go?
i'm leaving .
can i just say one thing?
only if you must .
that tale of an argument fifty years ago in no excuse .
poor anna .
will you hit me now?
flve
i hope i'm not interrupting .
no , i've just finished .
i practice in the mornings .
i'm replacing her .
i thought you played the cello .
i have an organ diploma .
in my time , it was smart to have one .
there were a lot of churches and few orchestras .
what were you playing?
a bach sonata for a trio .
first movement .
it was beautiful .
this is a unique organ from 1728 .
nobody knows how it ended up here , in the middle of nothing .
a few weeks ago , karin and i played a concert here .
it was almost full .
will you be playing any more concerts?
i don't have the time .
karin has to prepare her audition and i have to finish my book .
yes , i'm writing a book about bach's passion of st. john .
i met karin .
they say she's talented .
she's considered exceptional , and not only by her dad .
are you her teacher?
that's the way it's turned out .
in the conservatory , she'll have the best european teachers .
won't it be difficult to let her go?
yes .
you could say that .
do you love her a lot?
yes .
i'm sorry .
no , it's all right .
karin is like anna .
she doesn't look like her .
what's wrong?
whenever i mention anna , i cry .
that's the way it is .
i can't help it .
she's been dead for two years and it still hurts just the same .
that's the way it is .
life itself has become a ritual .
i don't know , i can't find words to describe it .
i've become a handicapped person .
just like that .
handicapped .
karin is everything that lends sense into my life .
and so ...
it wouldn't have much sense without her .
i think a lot about death these days .
one day i'll walk through the forest to the river .
a foggy , windless autumn day .
absolute silence .
then i see someone by the gate .
coming towards me .
she's wearing a denim skirt ...
a blue jacket ...
she's barefoot and her hair is tied up in a long pony tail .
and she's walking towards me .
anna is walking towards me , through the gate .
and then i realize i'm dead .
then something strange happens .
is it this easy?
we spend life thinking about death and what comes after .
and then it's so easy .
i can see a flickering light in the music .
like bach .
i think i understand .
come for dinner tonight .
we're good cooks .
thanks , i like that .
i have to go now , we've got a class .
karin gets angry if i'm late .
see you soon .
wait , i don't think i can go .
i understand .
the old man would get mad ... no .
why did you come here?
i don't know .
you're a lawyer , right?
can i sue him?
why would you want to do that?
he's got a fortune and won't die .
he's probably mummified by his own evil .
i asked him for an advance on my inheritance , but he humiliated me .
i'd love to sue him .
not while he's mentally competent .
he's not ill in that sense .
no , he's not ill .
are you here to ask for money for a poor abandoned wife?
don't get angry .
of course i ask myself .
you haven't had contact for decades .
i'm not here to ask for money .
are you fucking?
do you hate him so much to have to talk this way?
forgive me for desecrating this place and ruining our chat .
i hate him in all possible dimensions of the word .
i hate him so much , i would like to see him die from a horrible illness .
i'd visit him every day , just to witness his torment .
maybe i'm just a pathetic soul .
theoretically .
i see surprise and displeasure in your eyes .
as a lawyer , you should be used to ... the stupidity and repulsiveness in the world .
goodbye , marianne .
it was nice of you to listen to me .
sometimes i think i'm insane .
i suffer all the time .
slx an offer
karin !
hi , granddad .
well ... this is my study .
i haven't been here for years .
you and anna would come sometimes , when you were living at the lake house .
you used to smoke then .
yes , you're right .
i stopped when i read freud's biography .
33 operations for a mouth cancer .
and even then he couldn't stop smoking .
bur are you all right?
unless you consider aging an illness .
that's a beautiful picture of mom .
i found it by chance .
i had it blown up ... and there it is .
i think of mom every day .
and dream of her at night .
i thought the pain would subside .
but that's not happening .
but it doesn't hurt like in the beginning , now it's here .
like a part of me .
i wouldn't want to be without her .
i can say i miss her , painfully .
we didn't see each other very often , due to henrik and i.
anna tried and tried .
but henrik and i never managed ... well , you know .
you wanted to speak to me?
yes , sit down .
last night , mrs. nilsson came personally to deliver a letter .
meaning that dad shouldn't ...
that was all right .
he's in uppsala with his orchestra .
i have here a letter that came a few days ago , and it involves you .
have you heard of ivan chablov?
director in st. petersburg .
he toured here recently with the philharmonic .
fantastic !
i've known him since my years in leningrad .
this letter is from him .
johan , my dear friend and brother " .
sorry for writing in my poor english and german
but my excellent secretary has just had twins " .
it's very important that i write you , my dear friend " .
on a free night , i went to a young musician's concert " .
i must say i was surprised and happy " .
a young female cellist was playing ...
a zoltan kodaly solo piece .
and i was surprised by that young performer's talent .
" her maturity , her skill and courage " .
well , i'll be !
the school gave me her name ... " " and told me her father was her teacher .
i got in touch with him , but he rejected me curtly ,
maybe arrogantly is a better word .
my dear johan , i know you're ... " her grandfather .
and that's the reason why i'm writing you .
the young lady's technique is risky , somewhat lacking : " " which could result in a future catastrophe " .
i'm a guest professor at helsinki's sibelius academy ,
one of the best in europe .
i have a good rapport with the president .
and we could , after the mandatory exam ,
offer our young cellist a quality education ..
that her talent obviously deserves .
let me know your answer as soon as possible .
my embrace , ivan .
so , karin , what do you say?
maybe i should add ... that i'll take care of all your expenses as long as you need it .
i've made him a good offer .
more than he was asking for .
so if you want it , it's yours .
assuming , of course , that you accept chablov's kind offer .
i don't know what to say .
it's overwhelming .
i understand this letter puts you in an awkward situation .
i'll write him and tell him that you're ... flattered .
but that your decision affects others .
others?
your father , specifically .
i need to rest .
goodbye , karin .
thanks for the chat .
marianne used to say that i was a terrible character judge .
that i didn't understand emotions .
your mother lived in this world ... to do the most unbearable chore .
darkness got even darker ... and light faded away when anna died .
it's hard for henrik .
to live .
despite everything .
you're like your mother .
and i'm fond of you , katja .
goodbye , karin .
goodbye , grandfather .
seven anna's letter
to henrik from anna?
i found it in a book .
may 18 .
anna ... wrote it one week before dying .
i'd like you to read it .
i can't understand anna's handwriting .
you'll have to read it to me .
i'll try .
here , have some whisky .
mom had found out a few days before ... that she didn't have much time left .
she wrote the letter because henrik had a cold ... and wasn't allowed to visit her .
the fact that you can't visit me is , perhaps , a relief for both " .
we understand each other well .
you open the door .
i make an effort .
you make an effort " .
but i still see in your eyes how sick i am " .
this is the difficult part .
she writes about dad and me .
is that painful?
yes .
when you were with her at the hospital , did you speak about what she had written?
no , never .
what did she write?
dear henrik , i have to tell you something of which we've never spoken " .
i've wanted to talk to you about karin " .
but it was never necessary because i was always there " .
then i got sick and i was there no longer " .
of course i was there , but you kept me apart " .
you and i love each other .
i was sure about our love " .
but no love is strong enough ... to stand a devastating effect like my illness " .
i see that you love karin , but that you also tie her to you " .
it's good that you were her teacher , but there's a limit " .
when i'm no longer there , the limit will be unclear " .
i know that karin loves you " .
but you mustn't use her love .
you'll hurt her " .
that could be a permanent wound " .
that's why i ask you to let her go " .
you shouldn't take advantage of her kinship " .
don't take advantage of her because you're her self proclaimed teacher .
dearest henrik " .
you're so sensitive , so considerate , so kind " .
i know it , without a doubt , after so many years together " .
but you must be careful not to burden karin ... with the orphaned love that will remain when i'm no longer there " .
there's more , but i don't want to read any more .
i can't .
it hurts so much !
i can hear my mother's voice !
karin ...
why did you reach out to me?
you're very involved .
you could say that .
and you know about granddad s plans .
he told me .
i don't expect advise , i need to hear my voice aloud .
i believe things will clear up this way .
go ahead , speak .
mom saw .
yes , i think so .
and everything she warned about has happened .
i can't accept grandfather's offer .
why not?
if i leave henrik , he'll die !
if i leave him , he'll die ...
i'm sure about it , marianne ...
he doesn't even have his orchestra anymore !
he can go on with his music , but the county is reorganizing ... and dad will not be part of the administration : he'll resign .
i can't leave him .
i'm so tired of him sometimes !
i know all the things i can do in the future .
but mom is dead , and henrik can't manage his own life .
how do you think i'd feel with the guilt if something happened to him?
my future and henrik's are entwined for now .
at least you say " for now " .
only for consolation .
i want you to know that i don't feel the same as you .
i know .
anna's love ...
that letter is love .
isn't it?
i don't know .
elght
back already?
there wasn't much to do in uppsala .
hi , dad .
hi , little katja .
what score is that?
bach's suites for cello !
you're mad !
listen , anderberg suggested that you and i ... play a concert in november .
it's very hard for me .
we'll play together .
what do you mean together?
like a dialogue , facing each other .
you'll play the parts you can handle and i'll play the difficult ones .
especially the prelude .
it'll be great !
which parts can i play?
the sarabandes , for example .
it takes a lifetime to tame them .
we have three months .
and my audition?
it's almost ready .
and students get permission to play concerts .
i've spoken to brtz .
it'll be good for the both of us , now that i don't have the orchestra .
i won't even be the first violin any longer .
dad !
you must be furious !
perhaps .
but now i'll have more time for you .
i can help you better .
yes , of course .
that doesn't sound very encouraging .
hello , katja , darling .
i have a feeling an argument is coming .
what's wrong , katja?
i don't know .
that is , i think i know , but i don't know how to ...
i know you've talked to your grandfather .
and with the bitch , i mean marianne .
yes .
i see .
you did it beautifully .
i must decide .
i thought you had already done that .
no , you did it .
really?
i mean , is that what you've been thinking?
dad ...
i haven't bothered to think .
i thought , " dad knows what's best for me " .
perhaps you've already made up your mind , haven't you?
will you accept your grandfather's offer?
have you read this?
i have .
you read the letter that mom wrote me?
it speaks about me .
but it was for me !
and you read it .
just like that .
do you think that's all right because it speaks about you?
if you're going to get so upset , it's no use talking about it .
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
i said i'm sorry , damn it !
why do you say you're sorry? !
shall we get to work?
or is there something else?
dad ...
it'll be painful .
for you or for me?
it may sound stupid , but your tone frightens me .
i've made up my mind .
for the first time in my life it's my decision .
but are you sad?
yes , i'm sad .
if you had told me you had that letter from mom ...
if you had let me read it , maybe we could have ...
you never told me ...
you should have ...
well , that's the way it is .
how?
next week , i'm going to hamburg with emma .
she and i will be going to a school for young orchestra musicians .
claudio abbado will come in october and we'll go to munich .
it's for young people from all over europe .
you can't be older than 22 .
abbado will work with us for six weeks and we'll play four concerts .
emma recorded a video .
she sent it to the admission committee , as a joke ...
we played brahms .
emma and i got a letter ... which says the school accepts us .
that we're welcome .
and that ...
that's exactly what i want to do .
and it's exactly what i've decided to do .
and the conservatory?
how long is the hamburg course?
two years .
then there's a paid internship in an austrian or german orchestra
three years .
how will you pay for it?
i have my inheritance .
you've been thinking a lot .
i told emma it was useless .
that you had already decided .
god ...
oh god ...
but dad , i don't want to ...
i don't consider myself a soloist .
i want to play in an orchestra , be part of a team effort .
not sit down in a stage , alone and exposed .
i don't want strangers to say that i'm not good enough .
i want to decide my own future .
i want a simple life
i want to be ... home .
to live a normal life .
not a poor substitute for mom ... who gets your praise for something i'm not .
it has to end .
and now it's ended .
at least , give it the perfect ending .
what are you talking about?
wouldn't you like to play the fifth sarabande?
right now?
yes , please .
nlne cruclal moment
he's here .
thank you .
can i ask who it was?
from the hospital .
henrik tried to commit suicide .
with pills .
then he cut his arms and neck with a knife .
he's in intensive care .
call this number and ask for nurse ingegerd .
god .
they found him at the last moment .
a certain mrs. berg was walking by the house ...
and saw a naked person on the floor .
god .
the door was unlocked .
she tried to wake him up , but he was unconscious .
and bleeding .
the ambulance took 20 minutes .
my god .
i should call karin , but she's on her way to hamburg .
henrik systematically fails at everything .
he can't even kill himself .
say something , for god's sake .
you want me to answer that?
whatever .
say something spontaneous for once .
you can't .
sometimes you act like a forgotten character ... in some stupid old movie .
you're not real .
you don't say .
right now ... no , let's leave it .
no , go on .
where did you gather all this disdain?
i didn't remember you like this .
disdain?
yes !
i don't know .
any disdain i have is for myself .
i don't know .
i never thought of it this way .
and the poor boy?
boy?
ah , henrik .
maybe he realized he was a lot like me .
i was never like him .
so ridiculous all the time .
obese and submissive .
he surrounded me with a sticky love .
i admit i ignored that love .
he was as dedicated as a dog .
i wanted to kick him , metaphorically .
what will happen now?
how will this affect karin?
she'll blame herself .
she should have thought about it .
do you think she'll return home?
i don't know .
you'll speak to her , won't you?
if we find her .
i'll hire you as my agent .
how much do you charge?
money is no problem .
as long as you put her guilt in a safe .
what if she comes?
she loves that bastard .
that would be disastrous !
yes , i believe so .
what can i say?
i was so close to anna .
it was terrible when she left .
for me also .
even though i was on the outskirts of the catastrophe .
it's incomprehensible that henrik ... had the privilege of loving anna .
and that she loved him .
you're smiling ironically .
no .
i'm not smiling .
i'm trying not to cry .
there's no reason for you to cry .
there is , but i won't give any explanations .
ten the hour before the dawn
marianne .
marianne !
sorry to wake you up .
it's all right .
i'll go back to sleep .
what's wrong?
johan?
i don't know .
i think it's anguish .
anguish?
what do you mean?
i see !
you're sad !
i'm not sad ...
it's worse .
it's an anguish from hell .
it's bigger than me .
it's trying to make way through every orifice in my body ; my eyes , my ass .
it's like a huge mental diarrhea !
i'm too small for this anxiety .
are you afraid of death , johan?
more than anything , i'd like to scream .
what can you do with a baby that won't be comforted?
come , lay by my side .
there's no room .
we've slept in smaller beds .
we won't be able to sleep .
it doesn't matter .
not in the last days of our lives .
i have to take off my shirt .
it's damp from my diarrhea .
come on .
you take it off too .
yes
come on , johan .
come here .
there ... lie down .
good night , marianne .
good night .
could you explain why you turned up here?
i thought you were calling me .
i never called anyone .
i had it in my head .
how strange .
i understand your not understanding .
how long will you stay?
i have a case on the 27th .
november?
october .
good night , again .
good night .
perhaps you're asking yourself how it came out .
i stayed with johan until early october .
our time together was relaxingly pleasant .
we almost never talked about sensitive subjects .
the last night we celebrated .
nothing out of this world , but good enough .
we promised to remain in touch .
i think we even fantasized about a trip to florence ... the next spring .
that trip never happened , of course .
but we used to speak on the phone on sundays .
then , one day mrs. nilsson answered the phone .
she said that johan couldn't take any calls , but that he would write .
i asked if he was all right ; she said yes , as far as she could tell .
that he was just tired and that he would be writing .
i never got a letter , of course .
i wrote him , but never got an answer .
that's all i know .
things are always all right with me .
in order .
everything in its place .
maybe i'm a bit lonely , but i don't know .
sometimes ...
i think of anna .
i wonder how she managed her life .
how she spoke ...
how she moved ...
her look ...
that almost surreal smile .
anna's feelings .
anna's love .
well ...
something happened to me that perhaps is related to this .
when i came back , i visited my daughter martha at the sanatorium .
but i thought about the enigma ... that for the first time in our lives ...
i realized ...
i felt ... that i was touching my daughter .
my baby .
