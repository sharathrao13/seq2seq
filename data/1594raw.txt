hey , you want your pasta?

i'm litmus .
like iitmus paper .
when it's cold , my face gets blue .
when it's hot , my face gets red .
inside c , move out .
warden wants to see you .
name?
morris .
that's funny .
this file says frank lee morris .
if you disobey the rules of society , they send you to prison .
if you disobey the rules of prison , they send you to us .
alcatraz is not iike any other prison in the united states .
here , every inmate is confined alone to an individuai ceil .
unlike my predecessors , wardens johnson and blackweil ,
i don't have good conduct programs .
i do not have inmate councils .
inmates have no say in what they do .
they do as they're told .
you are not permitted to have newspapers or magazines carrying news .
knowledge of the outside world is what we teii you .
from this day on , your world wiii be everything that happens in this building .
you wiii shave once a day .
you wiii shower twice a week .
you wiii cut your hair once a month .
now , your privileges .
you can talk .
you can work .
other institutions hand out work , but here it's a privilege that you earn .
i promise you it's a privilege that you'ii want .
visitors you're ailowed two a month .
they cannot be former inmates of this or any other federai prison .
aii names that you submit wiii be carefuily checked by the fbl .
what names do you have in mind?
i can't think of any offhand .
family members?
none .
no family .
alcatraz is a maximum security prison with very few privileges .
we don't make good citizens , but we make good prisoners .
burglary , armed robbery , grand iarceny ...
you've escaped from quite a few prisons , haven't you?
that's why you're here .
alcatraz was built to keep aii the rotten eggs in one basket , and i was speciaily chosen to ensure that the stink from the basket does not escape .
since i've been warden some have tried to escape .
most have been recaptured .
those who haven't have been kiiled or drowned in the bay .
no one has ever escaped from alcatraz .
and no one ever wiil .
you two go everywhere together?
sure .
even to bed together .
and when i wash , he washes .
that way we sleep nice nice together .
capisce?
i'm wolf .
where did they transfer you from?
atlanta .
nice town , atlanta .
i never saw it .
i'm iooking for a ... new punk .
good iuck .
you don't understand .
i just found her .
why don't you show her what you can do?
morris , i need somebody in the iibrary .
take him over there , wiii you?
yes , captain .
move .
what you want , boy?
the buii sent me down here to work .
can you read ... boy?
as iong as it's in the english ianguage , boy .
you treat them aii iike wolf?
wolf wanted to get friendly .
i didn't .
you'ii take that cart to the ceils .
don't they iet cons down here?
you see any chairs?
how come?
because this is the rock , man .
they don't want you doing anything here ... but time ... hard friggin 'time .
rock affects dudes differently .
it either brings out your strength , or it breaks you .
what did it do for you?
what happens when you get out?
i won't .
10 years ago ...
i was in this bar in alabama when two dudes started hassling me .
that was their first mistake .
they puiled knives .
that was their second mistake .
they didn't know how to use them .
that was the iast mistake they ever made .
i got two 99 year sentences back to back .
seems iike you could have pleaded self defence .
the dudes were white , man , just iike you .
when i arrived they put me in one of those dark ceils in d block .
after a while , i went stir crazy .
sliced my achiiles 'tendon to get out .
you'ii see why when you see d block .
teii me something , you through kiiling white guys?
why?
weil , i don't know .
i just figured i wouldn't turn my back on you .
hey .
what's your name , man?
frank .
what's yours?
english .
see you iater .
your name?
morris .
ok .
magazine or book?
where's english?
what did they do , give a nigger a nigger of his own?
magazine?
hi .
hi .
i'm bugsy .
magazine?
thanks .
hey , you're new .
yeah .
hey , wait , wait a minute .
i haven't seen a new guy in six months .
it's nice to talk .
how are the brooklyn dodgers doing?
moved to la two years ago .
no kidding?
warden don't ailow no books in these ceils .
how come?
because there's no iight in them .
better deliver them books , morris , where they can be read .
right .
what's the flower?
that's something inside me they can't iock up with their bars and wails .
i'm doc .
you ever paint?
no .
why not?
you scared of dying?
i don't think so .
you better be .
you hurt wolf .
wolf's going to hurt you .
where you going , cracker?
pete .
something speciai about those steps?
the higher you sit , the more status you got .
so we play king of the mountain , except here we don't play for fun , man .
and you're king?
yeah .
now , i figure there's two reasons why you didn't sit down on my step .
either you're too scared , or you just hate niggers .
now , which is it , boy?
you too scared?
hmm?
nah .
i just hate niggers .
so no one's ever busted out .
no one's ever made it .
everyone has iooked for a way , but there ain't any .
see those hacks?
most joints have one hack for every seven cons .
there's one hack for every three cons here .
you start shitting at night instead of in the morning , they ask why .
let's say you're going to try it anyway .
first , you've got to get out of the ceil .
each bar has six hard smailer bars set in a steei tube with extra steei poured in .
and there ain't no way to tunnei out , either .
shit .
this island is solid rock .
see that water?
it's over a mile swim to iand .
the currents make it seem iike 10 .
and the water's so cold it wiii numb your arms in minutes .
even if you are a good swimmer , you won't have time to make it .
there are 12 counts every day .
sometimes i think that's aii this shit hole is , one iong count .
we count the hours , the buils count us , and the king buils count the counts .
inside !
everybody in !
i'm assigning you a permanent job ... the carpentry shop .
it's a paying job .
how much?
15 cents an hour .
weil , i always knew crime would pay .
it's a job .
see you iater .
i sleep iousy , but i sniff the glue .
it helps pass the nights .
aren't you afraid they'ii shake down your ceil?
then i go to the hole .
it's worth the chance .
i guess anything you want bad enough is worth the chance .
including busting out?
hey , maybe there's a way out .
it's on top of your head .
yeah .
the ventilator shafts on top of our block .
how do you get on top of the block?
ask the buii for the key .
thanks .
hey , jive dude , where you going?
summer's coming on .
it's getting cooler .
weather here is as crazy as the rock .
maybe crazier .
mark twain wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in san francisco .
i can ...
wolf's coming at you .
is his hand cupped?
yes .
which one?
his right .
break off !
drop it , wolf !
drop it , wolf .
you iike d block , wolf?
you better , because you're gonna rot there for a iong time .
d block , morris .
look , he came at me .
i said d block .
when i get out , you're dead .
you'ii be dead before you get out .
warden don't iike inmates fighting .
don't iike 'em stinking up their ceils , either .
lights out !
go on back to your ceil .
welcome to alcatraz .
hey , is anybody over there?
yeah , me .

charley butts .
how's the painting going , doc?
the one of the warden?
it's nearly finished .

he's very inspiring .
inside .
everybody in !
yes , sir?
i want painting privileges taken away from chester dalton .
doc?
ceii 233 .
what's the reason?
you're deputy warden .
you think of one .
when do you want the suspension to begin?
it's not a suspension .
it's an elimination .
right away .
yes , sir .
painting privileges have been removed .
why?
i don't know .
painting's aii i have .
i'm sorry , doc .
you ok , doc?
i think there's something wrong with him .
i'd keep my eye on doc .
he seems pretty upset .
cons are always upset about something .
put your overails on .
mr zimmerman , i'm making a new table .
i need a hatchet .
bob , get doc a hatchet .
mr zimmerman !
can you come over here for a minute?
get him out of here !
get him out !
take him out of here !
get him out !
get back to work .

everybody , back to work !
let's go !

what were you doing back there , boy?
how about a magazine?
why not?
what do you want?
i got boys life .
i know some queens who fight over it every month .
just give me what you got on top there .
i heard about doc ... and i know why he did it .
somebody took away his painting privileges .
who?
the warden .
morris .
sir .
i hear there was an accident in the shop .
accident?
oh , you mean doc .
someone didn't iike what he was painting , so someone won't iet him paint .
someone should have warned doc to be carefui what he paints .
i think you're absolutely right , sir .
there's always the possibility that some asshole wiii be offended ...
isn't there?
we have to be careful .
back in iine .
hey , how's it going , frank?
weil , weil .
if it isn't the anglins .
what are you guys doing , just dropping by?
thought we'd pay you a visit .
gonna stay iong?
not iong .
only about 15 or 20 years .
why the rock?
we were ieaving atlanta when we encountered a minor problem .
such as?
they saw us .
yeah , that do present a problem .
they shipped us to leavenworth .
but we didn't iike their accommodations , either .
warden said he knew just the place for us ... alcatraz .
is it true no one's ever escaped?
so they teii me .
jesus .
wonder what i'd be iike after 15 years here .
you stiii reading that bible?
oh , yeah .
it's opening up aii kinds of new doors .
i turned 35 today .
some birthday .
when's your birthday?
i don't know .
jeez , what kind of childhood did you have?
short .
i always wanted to see san francisco .
never thought it'd be iike this .
what'd you get sent to the rock for?
couple of years ago i started stealing cars , for kicks mostly .
i'd seii the parts .
got sent to the state pen .
you end up in alcatraz for that?
not exactly .
a buii there iiked to push me around .
so when i got out , i went back , and stole his car .
unfortunately , i drove it across the state iine , which made it a federai rap , and i was sent to the rock .
english !
visitor for you .
butts , you got a visitor .
me?
yeah , you .
probably somebody wants their car back .
heilo , father .
why didn't you say you were coming?
i was afraid you wouldn't iet me .
it's just hard to see you iike this .
your mama's going to die .
charley?
when?
weil , she's got a few months .
'can you caii her? '
we're not ailowed to make phone cails .
you cannot discuss institution rules .
stick to your personai iife .
this is my personai iife !
you getting a kick out of it?
heilo?
heilo !
i love you , charley .
hey , frank .
yeah?
if you try to get out , i want in .
must be wednesday .
why?
mystery mounds .
we always have mystery mounds on wednesday .
i can't taste it .
i just eat it out of habit .
what's the movie this weekend?
oh , some cowboy piece of shit .
hey , at ieast they could show us a gangsta movie .
i may have found a way out of here .
you iooking at something?
the way i figure it , this ceii block's reaily getting old .
the moist air corrodes the concrete .
the salt is rusting the metal .
i took a naii clipper and dug around the griile at the back of the ceil .
i can dig that griile out , and enlarge the hole into the utility corridor to the top of the ceii block and onto the roof .
how wiii we hide the hole?
we tear the ads from magazines ... no one wiii miss those ... make cardboard , paint griiles on that , and put it in the hole , maybe partiaily obscure it with a towei or whatever .
i've ordered an accordion to put in front of my hole .
