my heart
hello?
yes?
captain !
yes , we picked him up at the airport .
yes .
this picture .
you took it , didn't you?
it was found at the scene .
and you left the country and you left the country on the same day .
this belongs to my son who goes to primary school .
he wrote it on the ground and asked me to shoot it for his girlfriend in class .
and my trip was scheduled last semester .
you took pictures of ji kyung hee .
who?
the female owner of the studio !
you took her pictures .
no don't play hard ball .
you took her pictures !
she asked me to .
cut the crap !
she brought us pictures you took and told us everything .
she asked me to !
she was so serious i agreed .
it wasn't porn .
i took nude pictures of her .
is that a crime?
nude?
you took nude pictures of her?
so you're telling me ji kyung hee asked you to take pictures of her in the nude?
look , detective .
i have a family .
honestly , it's embarrassing ... to even be here .
kyung hee , right?
i think she had a crush on me .
i'm sorry .
i was testing my camera .
why didn't you tell me?
i could've been your model .
anything wrong?
you memorized my name and phone number !
of course you come every week !
why'd you take pictures of your feet?
of all the pictures , she showed so much interest in my nude ones .
why'd you keep going back?
you're a man .
put yourself in my shoes .
she's pretty and mysterious .
it's not a bad thing for a girl to be aggressive .
so i kind of enjoyed it .
you play at a concert hall , and i sing at a basement cafe .
we've turned out so differently .
tomato juice?
for her .
coffee is mine .
thanks .
why not drinking it?
it's pretty good .
try it .
you're seeing ki hoon lately?
change the subject .
i've had enough .
with what?
ka hee , please ...
please what?
tell me .
you like the way you live?
didn't you tell me?
taking pictures frees your soul ... ... like a little boy .
please .
she said her husband was out of town and asked me to take pictures of her in the nude .
i thought it was too much so i refused at first .
then again , i sometimes hire a professional model , and she was volunteering .
so you did?
mind giving me one?
don't you like the thrill?
i do .
getting there ... is more fun than being there .
don't you have that experience?
fucking is good , but the feeling after you come ...
i didn't sleep with her .
talk to me .
yes sir .
it's true he was at the library .
his library card confirms it .
what if he lent it to someone?
keep digging for witnesses .
and check out his wife too .
yes sir okay .
what now?
you know what?
it's quite boring sitting alone at the studio .
he started keeping me company ... and i was glad .
even thankful .
that was the beginning .
hands at first .
then the shoulders .
what do you think it meant?
maybe ... he wanted to sleep with me .
tell him about our rule .
one more for the loser !
cheers !
cheers !
come on !
you lost !
one more shot !
sorry about that .
give it here .
captain what?
let me drink just beer .
shut up .
you don't mix liquor .
but once you do , you go all the way .
