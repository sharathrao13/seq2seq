or we could just stay here and get drunk .
how about that?
or we could drink this later .
unless you have a reason ... ... why you don't want to get that beautiful body of yours wet .

i'd rather go swimming .

son of a bitch .

i'm about to be the biggest importer and distributor of x in north america .
you're gonna be a very rich young woman .
that's why i thought ...

johnny tapia is cutting up russian mob bosses in his mom's kitchen .
in the kitchen , syd .
he found a severed finger by the crock pot .
you're about to be in the middle of a drug war .
miami pd has arrested this guy 1 2 times with no convictions .
why don't you just hang back and let us bring him down?
guys , look , i need this , okay?
and i am this close .

i'm in charge of money laundering for his entire operation .
in a month or two we'll have enough for a conviction and it'll be over .

i think she can handle herself .
i'm gonna keep it real with you .
don't nobody know my sister like i do .

we lost the coffin ... ... and you barbecued our only lead , mike .
this has got to be the worst , most emotional cop week of my life .
yeah , it's been a little rough .
where were these bodies going?
i don't know .
it's really strange .
all the john does we found out here are empty .
empty does .
fat does .
cut them open , took the organs out .
sewed them back up .
nice work .
the more you guys fuck up , the more we look like rock stars .
the van you was chasing is a transport for the city morgue .
the john does were being delivered to the university for medical research .
nice going .
i can't believe you guys .
do you both wake up in the morning , call each other up?
good morning , marcus .
morning , mike .
how you doing?
a'ight .
so how are we gonna fuck up the captain's life today?
gee , i don't know .
i don't know .
ooh .
look , over there .
let's kill three fat people ... ... and leave them on the street .
they were dead before we ran over them .
it doesn't matter whether they were dead or not , goddamn it !
every time you leave a corpse on the street ... ... i have to get these forensic coroner guys to come to see what happened .
then i gotta get detectives .
see?
they're detecting shit .
then i gotta get these forensic guys to stick them back in the fucking bag !
jesus christ !
you guys , you're like ...
you're like a bunch of bloodsucking ticks ... ... draining the life's blood out of this department .
whoosah .
damn the whoosah , captain .
did you just call me a tick?
i was referring to him .
thought so .
these aren't normal corpses .
if i threw you out of a speeding ice truck ... ... and then ran over your head , you wouldn't be normal either .
think about this for a second .
these bodies have been emptied ... ... from a drug smuggler that just happens to own a mortuary .
i got a bunch of bodies waiting with plenty of room in them ... ... i could smuggle some shit .
johnny tapia has the perfect cover .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
johnny tapia?
i want a warrant to go into his mortuaries immediately .
no warrant .
what?
for what?
for what?
for a bunch of dead guys on their way to med research?
no .
every time we go after him , he sues us and wins .
this shit stops now or they'll fire us , disband tnt ... ... and stick me in a fucking coffin .
this is over now !
what happened to " whatever it takes "?
that was pre vehicular manslaughter .
not to mention johnny tapia ...
what the fuck is that?
oh , shit .
shut up .
shut up .
shut up .
shut up .
this man has violated my rights !
who the fuck is that?
running people over is not enough for you?
now you're into kidnapping?
that man is a criminal .
okay?
we busted him at the ...
excuse me , i have so much brass up my ass ... ... i could be playing " the star spangled banner .
i ain't cut out for this , man .
come on , man .
i can't do this with you right now .
i'm re evaluating what's important .
about what?
being a cop?
no , about you being my partner .
is this about syd?
god !
hey , marcus , man ...
that was messed up , but that ain't what this is about , mike .
once we nail tapia , you and me , we're over .
i already signed my transfer papers .
megan , what's the name of this boy taking you to the movies?
reggie .
daddy , please don't embarrass me and ask him a lot of questions .
everybody knows you're a cop , and it makes people nervous .
well , why nervous?
he on crack?
it's cool?
yeah .
come in .
what'd you ...?
i got a sneak and peek .
judge sinclair said we can go into the mortuary tonight .
we can't touch nothing , but if we find something ... ... he'll give us a righteous warrant .
you love pissing captain howard off , don't you?
it's what i do .
so when you start playing golf?
hey , so you real serious about this transfer thing , huh?

cuba?
united states does not negotiate with hostage takers .
especially cuban hostage takers .
it's a delicate situation .
this is not just a situation .
this is my sister .
off the record , all state department agencies ... ... are using their back channel contacts for a diplomatic solution .
you know , by the time y'all finish being diplomatic ... ... my sister could be in a fucking box .
this is bullshit .
he ain't getting away from us that easy .
we ride together ... ... we die together .
bad boys for life .
we just gotta do it ourselves , man .
i don't know you .
you look like you're about to do something stupid .
i'm in .
dodd tell you how crazy us ex delta guys are?
my brother , tito , lives in cuba .
he's a little crazy , but he's hooked up with the underground .
weapons , men , a safe house .
whatever we need .
you can forget about passports and all that stuff .
because if the cubans catch us , we're all dead .
my brother tito's in alpha 66 , the anti castro underground .
what does that have to do with tapia?
everything .
tapia's the biggest supplier of drug cash to castro .
so alpha 66 will be all over him .
brother , that is perfect .
he says he can get men on the tunnel right away .
let me holler at him .
tito , we need layout , security , the whole deal .
we got info that tapia's got a casket coming in tomorrow at 4 : 00 p . m .
yeah , that might be our way in .
yeah .

they're spies .
former delta intel and demo .
requesting permission to tag along .
ronnie , i hear there's a boat on fire off the coast of cuba .
shouldn't we break international waters to help them?

tito?

damn .
what's up with the safe house across the street from tapia's crib?
this is the last place anyone would look .
we've been watching the place .
guards play soccer each day at 3 : 30 .
the bad news , everyone knows he uses the army like his bodyguards .
this is tapia's compound .
cla hooked us up , huh?
yeah .
this lldar laser technology even shows his escape tunnel .
the alarm security is wired to the army .
we're screwed if we don't blow up this security room before we make a move .
the tunnel we're digging branches off .
one under his back yard and the other into his escape tunnel .
we gotta hurry up .
see?
i told you my brother was a maniac .
how we looking?

papi , you look like jesus .
why they call this the last supper?
it was the last time they were all together before jesus was crucified .
crucified?

i mean , who had this fucking idea?
i just want little angels looking down on me .
okay , here's the ocean , 300 yards from tapia's house .
we're here .

first team takes out the security station .
second tunnel comes through into the center of the house .
