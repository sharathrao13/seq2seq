23 . 976
this is a story of the past ... ... and the future .
we will come to the future , but first , the past .
here we have the earl of warwick .
we can see by his petulantly arched brow ... ... that he is not enroute to a good deed .
mmm .
obey !
enchanted .
do you wish to live , old witch?
you have committed grave crimes ... ... against god and your king , have you not?
have mercy , my lord .
silence .
the frenchman count thibault of malfete ... ... shall wed lady rosalind , the daughter of our king .
i desire that woman .
hmm .
i alone am fit to take her hand .
and her castle , lands , the riches that are her dowry .
thou art not as stupid as thou art hideous , old hag .
tomorrow night ... ... the king shall feast the arrival of the count .
i want the count dead before the feast is over .
a small fortune in gold ... ... awaits the sorceress who doth my bidding .
not so fast .
how shall i know thy magic is sufficient to the task?
does thou find proof enough in this?
aah !
that will do !
take it , witch !
was that proof enough , my lord?
come to the king's castle tomorrow night ... ... and carry out my plan .
if you fail ... you will be burned .
ohh !
our hero , of course , knew none of this .
he was safely in his entourage ... ... traveling , he thought , to his wedding .
here he is ... the count of malfete .
he is also a duke , a baron , and a lord .
a nobleman , plagued by only those small things ... ... which inconvenience a knight ... ... the permanent presence of his sisters ... ... his mother and father ... ... and , as all knights must endure ... ... an idiot servant , andre ... ... whose smell made people faint ... ... a considerable achievement ... ... among a population who never bathed .
down , peasant !
the duke , or thibault ... ... as his subjects were not allowed to call him ... ... was joyous .
the long awaited day of his marriage ... ... had come at last .
what have we got here?
another lot of bloody royal bastards?
must be that french duke ... ... come to marry the king's daughter .
mind the forest !
there be dragons who'll make dinner ... ... from your bones in there !
andre loved and protected his master .
master !
master !
the forest ... it is haunted !
thibault responded .
thank you , master .
with every step ... ... he came closer to the castle of his beloved .
he hoped he would be with her soon ... ... for rare was the journey in which thibault ... ... did not have to stop and rescue someone .
this was no exception .
for like his ancestors ... ... he lived by an ancient family rule ...
a woman in distress !
the only one he knew .
aah !
aah !
beware , sire .
courage was more than a duty .
courage was his creed .
aah !
andre !
join your master !
i'm talking to you !
go , go !
stupid peasant !
sire !
behind you !
ohh !
naturally .
courage is our creed !
he was invincible .
except he was not invincible ... ... against witchcraft .
for this would be his last victory ... ... in this millennium .
afternoon , sir .
i hear a rumor ... ... thou art marrying tomorrow , my lord .
i have heard this rumor .
i have also heard ... ... the bride is the most beautiful in all of england .
but it is not true .
it is not?
no .
am i not the most beautiful bride ... ... in all of england?
no .
wait .
the most beautiful bride ... ... in all the world .
wear this for me , thibault .
wear it against thine heart .
thou shalt always be true .
lady rosalind .
thou shalt not disgrace thyself ... ... before the wedding .
i must hide and dress for the banquet .
ooh ooh ohh !
sire , your bride looks like a gorgeous sparrow .
silence , you impudent peasant .
show respect to your future mistress .
yes , master .
ah !
thank you , my lord .
quite so , your majesty .
when our lady drinks her wine ... ... her eyes will fill with hellish visions .
the count will appear as a hideous beast .
then my magic will compel her to kill him .
hahaha .
my dear friends and noble guests .
thibault , count of malfete and papincourt ... ... i hereby declare this castle a wedding present .
hearye !
your majesty , in every way that i am able ... ... i will serve my beautiful lady ... ... and do honor to thy kingdom .
drink of my cup and you will know my thoughts .
and thou will know mine .
uhh !
my lord?
uhh !
thibault !
my lord !
ohh !
ohh !
aah !
what is it , thibault?
this is not the kind of behavior .
what is happening to you , my son?
are you crazy?
drunk?
count thibault , this is no way to behave ... ... in an english court !
beasts from hell !
ohh !
that is my mother !
thibault , that is my mother !
demon !
oh , no !
no !
what have i done?
it is not me .
it is witchcraft !
andre , find me a wizard !
france must pay for this treachery .
find me a wizard !
have pity on a poor condemned man .
we are here for the last rites .
my lord !
we have to hurry .
what wizard is this?
he's english , my lord .
but his magic is very good .
your bloody earl of warwick did this to me .
indeed he did .
and he'd have me , too , if he knew that i was here .
i beg you , my sire .
let him save you .
can you bring my lady back from the dead?
i can reanimate her corpse ... ... but i don't think that my lord ... ... would like the way she looks ... or smells .
there is another way .
time is like a mountain .
riddled with tunnels .
i can open one of these tunnels for thee ... ... and return thee to the moment before the murder .
if thy will is strong enough .
don't you think this priest has had enough time?
hurry up , father .
unlock this door !
now !
drink this potion , my lord ... ... and thou shalt descend into the mountain of time .
ohh !
it smells awful .
you should not drink that .
what if you become a frog , or goat's feet?
you are right .
drink first , bastard .
and if you die , i will avenge your death .
what are you doing in there?
open this door !
open this door !
it tastes like the shit of the pork .
and he should know .
ohh .
per horus et per ra ...
et per salem ... ... invictus .
ducere !
i forgot the grouse eggs .
oh , it's a disaster .
i've lost them in the corridors of time .
open this door !
open this door !
wow .
cool !
this is cool .
this is pretty cool , yeah .
look at them !
shh .
see the peasant sleeping on the floor?
in those days , people didn't think ... ... that peasants deserved any better than that ... ... and they were considered the property of their masters .
now , the boss of this peasant is the knight .
see how beautiful the knight's clothing is?
miss rodett , that one is hot , and it just snorted !
now , tammy , that's impossible ... ... because they're just mannequins ... ... and mannequins don't snort .
well , that one just did .
no , because they're not real .
they're just like ... dolls .
aaah !
oh , shit !
what are you doing in my chamber?
aaaah !
your chamber ... ... has been cleaved in half , my lord .
this is not the castle !
what?
oh , look at this , my sire !
it is satanic !
ohh .
this is hell , and we are condemned souls .
come .
we shall find the prince of this netherworld ... ... and beg his mercy .
wait for me , my lord !
dr. brady , come quick .
two guys with swords and armor ...
miller , you're always overreacting .
now , relax .
there's absolutely no need to ...
police are on their way .
peasant , please .
show me the way out of this prince castle !
yes !
pee yoo !
out this way .
they stink !
have a nice day .
bye .
good luck .
wait !
peasant !
wait !
stop !
what is this?
the gates of hell !
look at its eyes of fire !
dragon !
it's a red dragon !
attack !
what the hell are you doing?
take that , beast !
we have killed it !
ah , yes .
it is no longer breathing .
god is punishing us for practicing the black arts .
let us pray for forgiveness .
heavenly father , forgive us our sins .
we are so , so , so , so , so ... so sorry .
dr. brady?
ah , julia .
this is julia malfete ... ... who heads up the medieval art department .
she donated the famous 12th century castle exhibit .
julia designed the exhibit where we found the two men .
that stuff right there is the result of the body search .
the big guy had the gold coins ... ... the sword , the shield , and that ring .
the little guy had the salt pork ... ... the sausage , the dagger ... ... a molar .
and that box ... which he probably stole .
not from us .
most thieves take valuable things .
they usually don't bring them .
this is a gothic pixis ... ... and this is the kind of design they were making in canterbury ... ... at the end of the 12th century .
it has emeralds and rubies .
why did the two men sleep here?
they could've booked a suite at the ritz .
so , you said that you got these out of their pockets?
that's right .
except the sausage .
hmm .
mm hmm .
this stamp ring is fantastic .
my family's coat of arms .
sergeant , can i meet these thieves?
master , i'm hungry .
my tummy rumbles like a beast .
how can you think of food after such tragedy?
yes .
what i would not give to see once more my precious ...
my lord !
look , she's alive !
rosalind .
my fair rosalind .
my bride .
my ravishing flower .
mistress !
my mistress !
what are you doing?
it is a miracle .
a miracle .
do i know you?
do you not recognize me , my lady?
i am the count of malfete and papincourt ... ... the duke of anjou .
i am your faithful thibault .
you're who?
and i am andre le pate , valet of the count .
please , forgive me for what i did to you ... ... my dear rosalind .
my name isn't rosalind .
it's julia .
no !
you are my rosalind .
the lock of hair you gave me on our wedding day .
i carry it over my heart .
please , my love , see for yourself .
you see?
it is the color of wheat on a summer's day .
the color of candle light .
it is your own .
stop this !
that's enough !
rosalind !
you'll be safer outside !
do not leave me !
do not be afraid !
you don't want to see this .
courage is our creed !
courage is our creed !
wait , stop !
i know this man !
courage is our creed .
that's our family motto .
this man is my cousin .
it's in here .
you see , i thought he was dead .
he disappeared when a storm ... ... capsized his yacht during the admiral's cup .
they never recovered his body ... ... so , of course , declared him dead .
he was a very distant french cousin of mine ... ... but as the last living malfete , i inherited his estate .
if he's your cousin ... ... what do you want me to do with him?
sire .
why does lady rosalind call herself julia ... ... and allow us to be beaten and chained?
peasant ... ... this is not our time .
the wizard did not send us into the past .
he sent us into the next millennium .
we are thirty generations removed from malfete .
julia is not my beloved .
she's my descendant .
descendant?
amber , it's julia .
could you get me hunter?
it's important .
that rabbit of yours is on the phone again .
hey , bunny .
what's up?
thibault malfete just showed up at the museum .
thibault malfete?
that's impossible .
isn't he supposed to be ...
i know .
are you sure it's him?
he looks exactly like his photos .
hunter , he quoted the family motto .
does he know yet that we're selling his entire estate?
well , it's hard to say what he knows .
he's a little strange .
hunter , this is terrible .
i mean , it's wonderful that he's alive ... ... but it's terrible that we started to sell the estate .
oh , god , i feel awful .
the english courts declared him dead .
we're well within our legal rights .
how were we supposed to know he was still alive?
has he mentioned anything about money?
money?
how can you worry about money at a time like this?
no , i'm just worrying about you .
you don't handle surprises well .
where is your cousin now?
he and this friend of his are downstairs with security .
why don't we bring them home with us tonight?
he's family after all .
we want to be hospitable .
you're wonderful .
i'll pick you all up in about five minutes .
love ya .
bye , bunny .
bye , big bear .
oh , my god .
thibault malfete's still alive .
this is a disaster .
blah , blah , blah .
you're pouting .
i hate it when you call her bunny .
you , my dear , are so much hotter than a bunny .
my god , look at yourself .
you're a tigress .
ha ha ha ha ha .
aah !
lady julia , there has been a terrible mistake .
i'm so sorry .
we thought you were dead .
dead?
no , the wizard was a fool , but not a killer .
he only sent us the wrong way .
excuse me?
we fell into the mountain of time .
wow .
i must return to my time to prevent ... ... a great tragedy to our family .
i ask for your assistance .
i'll do whatever i can .
ohh !
awful .
ohh .
whoa !
we must not go out !
what ... what are you doing?
what are you doing?
no , we have to wait outside .
hunter can't park here .
we have to wait for him .
oh , my god .
bloody coward .
we have to ...
those boys are lost .
i must go and retrieve them .
aaah !
aah !
this is england?
no ...
meat !
this is chicago .
meat , meat , meat !
this is the united states .
meat !
the last i remember was in sussex , england ... ... in my castle chambers .
you don't remember anything since then?
no .
do you think maybe you've suffered ... ... some sort of memory loss from the accident?
yes !
after i drank the potion , i remember nothing .
onions?
all of them !
all right .
you like to eat hot dogs , huh?
i like to eat every kind of dog .
now , what are you doing?
aargh !
leave the dogs !
no , no , no .
stop it !
please , stop .
i'm sorry , i'm so very sorry .
he's french .
yeah .

but i can certainly tell that you are .
and this is andre , thibauit's assistant .
hello , big nose .

yes , master !
he can't run behind the car .
he cannot ride with us .
he's not noble .
yes , but he has to ride in the car .
he's very fast .
we're taking the freeway .
you can run 70 miles an hour , can ya?
i have good boots .
no .
you must sit in the car , please .
i am fast .
i'm sure you are .
i'd love to see you run sometime .
obey .
yes , my lord .
do you want some dog?
too fast .

ohh .

honey , could you slow down just a little bit?
i'm going 22 miles an hour .
yes , i know .
could you try going 21?
hey , what's the matter with you?
you don't know how to drive?

hurry up .
ahh .
how did you do that?

i do not have this invention in my castle .
you don't have power?
i have the power to judge and condemn to death ... ... any villain on my land .
oh .
really?
hunter will be so jealous .
i'm gonna get you two something to drink .
make hunter one of his power dude smoothie things .
i'd offer you one ... ... but nobody seems to like them but him .
andre , could you please stop that?
i'm just starting to feel like i'm in a disco .
my dear lady ... ... you said you would offer me your assistance .
oh , yes .
anything .
what do you need?
i need to find a wizard .
aah !
sorry , master .
sorry !
sorry !
idiot !
apologize to the lady !
oops .
sorry , master .
i ask for mercy .
forgive him , milady .
it's ok .
the floor needed to be cleaned anyway .
so , you were saying something about what ... ... should we say a wizard?
i need to go back into the tunnels of time .
of course .
i need to just understand what has happened to you .
now , your yacht went down in a storm?
no .
you must listen .
i am from the time of thibault vl ... ... and i have come to the future .
ok .
tunnels of time .

thibault vl .
oops !

yes , lady .
lovely flower , i see doubt , you do not believe me .
it is a pity , but please ... try .
oh .
yes .
of course i'll try .
she's green .
i never really did like the taste of this .
oh , my god .
what happened?
nothing .
i'm eating this very good meat ... ... with vegetables in a fine sauce .
i will shit easy tomorrow .
it's jet lag .
all right , i'm sure you would like to wash your hands ... ... and whatever else .
why don't you come with me?
all right .
here you go .
just gonna take this .
julia !
can i talk to you for a moment , please?
don't be bashful with the soap .
what is it , master?
a throne?
it could be .
they're crazy !
they have been through a terrible ordeal .
ok?
they have amnesia .
amnesia?
they're wacked !
they're completely retarded .
they're ...
woo !
you know?
clean water .
ha ha !
the long towel has a good fragrance .
thibault is my cousin , hunter .
he's my family .
yeah?
i'm not so sure .
he doesn't strike me as being particularly noble .
julia , come down here !
it's kind of an emergency .
very good fountain .
yes .
your french relatives are bathing in the toilet .
oh , my god .
toothbrushes .
i'll just leave them right here .
i'll be right back .
i'm going to take a shower ... ... then go tackle that kitchen .
hurry .
our dinner reservation's at 8 : 00 .
oh !
where are we going?
latour .
isn't that just a little formal for our guests?
first you tell me your cousin's nobility ... ... then you get mad at me when i suggest ... ... that just maybe , just maybe , he's not .
now you're upset because i pick the best restaurant in town .
you make it impossible for me to do the right thing .
no .
you're right .
latour's gonna be great .
thank you , big bear .
i'll be in the shower .
all right .
ah .
very good flavor .
this is not wine , ignorant peasant .
it is oil for the bath .
mmm .
very good perfume .
very creamy .
bathe , servant .
no , my sire .
i have taken a bath at christmas .
bathe !
no , no !
i'm afraid !
i don't want to catch cold and die !
be silent , peasant !
ahh .
do you have another bottle of this bathing oil for andre?
do you realize the bath you just took ... ... cost over $2, 000?
that's american dollars .
is that a lot?
yes , it is .
then i will repay you with one of my swans .
oh , well .
that sounds fair .
my family tree .
so many descendants .
hello?
mr. cassidy , please .
yeah .
hold on one second .
hunter?
yeah , bunny?
honey , it's your office .

i'll take it upstairs .
oh , ok .

i'm andre le pate .
i have big balls ... ... and my ass breathes fire .
wow .
that must hurt .
hello .
hello?
i told you never to call me here .
well , i forgot .
hello !
enter !
somebody there with you?
aah !
jesus !
hangup the damn phone , or i'll call the police !
i think he hung up the phone .
it was thibauit's little retarded homuncular assistant .
look , this is dangerous .
i'll call you back after julia goes to bed , ok?
lady julia .
you are more than a rose .
you are love's own flower .
come on .
that's ridiculous .
no , i just ...
this old thing , i threw it on .
i haven't worn it in a couple of years ... ... but i guess i should learn how to take a compliment .
thank you .
almost .
thank you .
much better .
kissing cousins .
ooh la la .
i don't think that i've ever seen anyone ... ... eat a steak in two bites before .
ah .
thank you , master !
be blessed !
i can assure you ...
thank you !
like some more truffle sauce with that?
excuse me , but the gentleman ... ... can't eat off the floor .
he's not a gentleman .
he's my servant ... ... and he's not worthy of our company .
thank you .
i'm truly sorry , sir .
andre , would you please ...
no , no , milady .
it is not possible .
please .
thibault , please , will you let him sit at the table?
for me?
i will please you , lovely one .
obey , foolish wart .
thank you .
and you were worried they wouldn't be comfortable .
actually , the floor wasn't such a bad place for him .
easier to hose down .
cheese !
very good cheese !
andre , what are you doing?
what are you doing?
andre?
no , no !
andre , no .
no .
bad !
hey .
sit down .
eat this .
hunter , could you ...
no .
this is for dessert .
all right?
please , sir , please .
i'm sorry .
i'm terribly sorry .
just add it to the check .
ok , all right?
thank you .
you eat this after dinner .
allright?
no , it's allright .
i'm terribly sorry .
just add it to the bill .
thank you .
all right .
do i have something on my face?
you remind me of the daughter of a king .
thank you .
on the subject of julia's noble ancestry ... ... you do understand why she was granted control of the estate?
julia is a malfete .
everything i have is hers .
so you have no objection if she retains control?
no .
wonderful .
i'm sure you'll be very pleased with our plans .
they're going to make us ...
i mean you and julia ... very wealthy .
i am already wealthy .
i own hundreds of horses ... ... ten chests of pepper , four hundred bags of wool ... ... and fifty barrels of spanish olives .
and you own me , sire .
yes , but you have no value .
that is true .
excuse you .
leave nothing for the devil !
did you hear that?
yes , i did , sweetheart .
they're not in very good health , all right?
so , just try to ignore it , if you can .
sire .
what?
i want to make pee pee .
ah !
you want to pee?
yes .
outside !
outside?
but , sire ...
i could be eaten by the wolves .
find a torch !
idiot .
find a torch .
andre has such simple needs .
i think that's great .
need some help , sir?
oh , it is beautiful .
the water comes out by itself .
ha !
it is a magic fountain .
look at this !
mmm .
it smells just like the forest .
all the forest is in the small wheel .
mmm .
smell it !
no .
no , thank you .
you don't want to smell it?
enjoy yourself .
the castle's a wreck .
so i'm helping her divide the estate up ... ... into more manageable , profitable chunks .
we're selling the art and various high end pieces ... ... through an outlet here .
essentially , i'm protecting her .
i see that as my role .
and the land?
i decided we should sell that , too .
it is not for you to decide .
only lady julia can say what will be done .
i speak for both julia and myself .
you cannot possibly speak for a malfete .
what are your wishes , milady?
well , um ...
i guess i'd like to think about it ... ... a little bit more , actually .
julia?
the lady has spoken !
chicken salad , now !
i want that cake .
come on now .
don't take all night .
greasy chicken .
what on earth do you think you're doing?
hi , andre .
i'm afraid i'm going to have to add an order ... ... of chicken a la umbrella to your bill .
smell the forest .
yes , it's minty .
it's from the blue fountain .
nice .
yeah .
oh , all right .
honey , would you like a mint?
yeah .
all right .
good .
thibault?
master .
those are good .
give me another one .
yes .
very minty .
ow !
ah ...
good evening , fine sir .
i'm seeking thibault of malfete ... ... the duke of anjou .
the great chevalier?
andre does not need a bed .
he will be happy with some straw .
yes .
we're out of straw .
my bed is soft .
it's time for the " family feud .
aah !
oh !
poor little people .
they're trapped inside !
oh !
god have mercy .
what are we going to do , my sire?
free them .
chuck , marilyn , norma , terry , and linda .
now let's start the " family feud " !
bunny?
you really think these guys have amnesia?
i don't know .
we are coming !
so you admit they're clinically insane?
i didn't say that .
oh , come on !
where did they go , my lord?
they were inside .
we could not save them .
it is tragic .
well , we never really used this room anyway .
it's a pity .
aah !
i need to find a wizard now .
um ...
do you mind if i get some coffee first?
hi .
jesus christ !
i've told you not to leave this stuff ... ... in the middle of the driveway !
what are you trying to do?
you just about broke my goddamn neck !
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to .
do you actually do any gardening around here ... ... or do you just sing out of tune?
just clean it up !
aah !
oh !
hey , big belly !
you dare to touch a lady?
who the hell are you?
i'm andre , and i piss on you .
yeah , well , you get the hell out of here ... ... or i'm gonna call the cops .
apologize to the lady .
lady?
you're calling her a ...
lady .
right .
i'm sorry .
kiss her feet .
do what?
kiss her feet !
oh , jesus !
instead of a wizard ...
i think what we really need to find you is a good doctor .
wizards are the best doctors .
what in the world is that?
what are you doing?
call 911 !
what is going on here?
he was very rude to the lady .
look , fool .
a coat of arms .
he is a nobleman .
i did not know .
stupid peasant .
who are these guys?
visitors .
do you own this woman?
she works for me .
then i will hang my valet by his feet on your behalf .
no , please , my lord .
not by the feet !
i prefer the thumbs .
i got a meeting to catch .
rise , idiot .
i give him to you for the day .
you may beat him if you like .
thanks , but , you know , we just met .
thank you , my great and merciful master .
thank you , milord !
thank you !
let us go .

thibault?
i'm starting to believe you .
i'm starting to believe everything ... ... and that is a really , really big leap for a 21st century girl .
i just want you to appreciate that .

andre has something to say to thibault .

i guess i was wrong .
thibault , he was standing by the river .
the saddest , most beautiful thing i'd ever seen .
hmm .
well ... ... that thibault really is a special guy .
yes .
yes , he is .
that's why i've decided to give the entire estate back to him .
you what?
honey , did you know that the women of my lineage ... ... are all lionhearted?
they still haven't brought the stiff down?
i heard somebody say the old geezer's body parts ... ... are sticking to the ground .

well , that feels better .
can i come in?
what do you got?
finger prints don't match .

you know what , hunter?
i don't look like a bunny .
i don't act like a bunny .
i don't think like a bunny .
and if you loved me ... ... you wouldn't have made me try to feel like a bunny .
i am strong , and i am smart ... ... and i don't need you to take care of me .
