joshua?
you're a big fella .
joshua !
you trying to scare me to death?
hello , mike .
the <i>lycosa narbonensis</ i> looks different today .
it's bigger .
it's their diet .
i made a discovery .
these have been in the pond for the past three days . crickets?
they're like ... spider steroids .
i see dead people .
i see dead people .
he loves that movie .
i don't ...
there they go !
look , look !
he was hungry !
as they grow , their appetites do too .
i've never seen spiders this big .
it's because of those crickets?
i'm gonna make a fortune .
jumping spiders !
yeah , <i>habronattus orbus . </ i>
look , look how they kill .
i call this an arach attack .
get it?
yeah .
it's good .
have the orb weavers come in?
took me forever to get that mating pair .
i had to bribe every customs agent from santiago to tucson .
but here .
that is too cool .
see , the male orb weavers compete for the female's attention .
they all try to give her the best present .
like bugs ... ... or , you know , rats or the occasional parrot .
let me show you something .
you see , the prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest .
you know how women like breakfast in bed .
look at it .
look at this , look at her .
the female is three times as big as the male .
say hello to consuela .
she fills her prey with digestive acid ... ... to liquefy it so she can drink it from inside out . while it's alive .
man ... ... am i in trouble .
i have to go .
i'll call you later , okay?
next week , i bet they're twice as big as today .
bye , josh .
see you next week !
where did you go , little fella?
i see dead people !
i see dead ... !
sorry , sonny .
we aren't hiring .
you sure?
i'm a pretty good engineer .
do i look like a woman who isn't sure?
yeah , well ...
i used to know my way around here .
we aren't hiring . we're laying off .
we're three months from a going out of business sale .
got the picture?
yeah , i got the picture .
but my name's not sonny .
it's chris .
chris?
aunt gladys . welcome home .
bad dog !
no !
pete , what are you doing out here?
well , we got a ...
no .
question is , what are you doing out here?
you were supposed to stay home .
what did you find , mom?
some jerk tossed a barrel of chemicals off the road .
looks like it's been out here a couple of weeks . who knows how much contamination it's caused .
the water is contaminated?
pete , send a sample down to the epa lab in phoenix .
let's see what they come up with .
i have to tell joshua !
that's where you were going?
i told you no more visits to that spider farm , didn't i?
you're grounded .
but i have to tell joshua about this .
i don't want you hanging out with him .
those spiders are dangerous .
they give you nightmares , and you keep me up all night .
you know what happens when i don't get enough sleep , right?
bad mood?
put your bike in the truck .
can you help him with his bike?
yeah , okay , sure .
hang on , mike .
<i>party's over , gentlemen . </ i>
<i>off the bikes . </ i>
great , this is all i need .
she is the sexiest sheriff in the country .
i know , it's weird .
you bought yourself a reckless , bret .
give them a break .
get in the truck , ashley .
mom !
now .
give me your license .
come on , sheriff .
anything you say can be used against ...
shut up !
you have a right to an attorney .
if you can't afford an attorney ...
larry , do we know anybody at city hall who might be able to take care of this?
bret , isn't your stepfather the mayor?
put my daughter in danger again , i'll show you how little that means to me . we're cool , sheriff .
do you think g string or underwear?
definitely thong .
you're kidding .
gonna pay for this?
no .
sweet .
that was really sweet .
i heard that !
whatever .
bret , i can't believe my mom gave you a ticket .
it was humiliating .
i need the phone .
you don't .
you have no friends .
i can't get any privacy around here , you know?
hello?
my god .
anybody know what's going on with the phone?
come on , joshua .
pick up !
how much?
it don't make sense . wait .
this is a town meeting , not the wwf .
mayor? why can't those of us that want to sell , sell? viroanol wants all of our properties or none of them .
let's face it , the town's going broke .
they'll pay us to relocate .
how do we know this isn't another one of your get rich schemes ... ... like building this ridiculous mall out here?
they scrapped plans to run a freeway here ...
or that stupid ostrich farm of yours .
it's good meat .
it's healthy .
everybody here is having some financial problems .
i want to get out from under this .
the rest of you should too .
this is a government cover up , isn't it?
what are you talking about?
why they giving so much money?
just to get to the mines?
they want to put the empty mines to use .
it's safe .
the only reason that we've kept this town going ... ... is the hope the mccormack mines could turn their selves around ... ... and put everybody back to work .
it is not happening .
old man mccormack , god rest his soul ... ... he's dead .
as dead as those mines .
well , mr. mayor ... ... before he died ... ... he claimed he'd seen that vein .
let's be honest , leon .
the man was hallucinating .
those mines are filled with methane gas .
you're gonna load that gun with toxic waste?
this is for landowners only .
i am a landowner , wade . chris mccormack !
i didn't know you were back .
my father said he'd found the agua mesa lode .
i believe him .
he said a lot of things near the end .
i'm not selling the mine .
chris !
wait up !
you're being foolish .
back off .
your father was delusional .
shut the hell up about my father .
i'm warning you .
since when did you care about the mines?
you've been gone 1 0 years . wade ...
don't make the town suffer ... ... because you feel guilty you weren't around when your father died .
i'm talking to you .
i warned you !
what the hell are you doing?
that's it !
i'm pressing charges .
i want him arrested .
go home , wade .
put some ice on your nose . curve around 20 feet away from the scene of a misdemeanor .
thank you .
ten years and you have not changed a bit .
lay low for a couple days , all right?
good to see you again , sam .
just like old times .
everything will be sorted out in the morning .
so you still like men .
what are you talking about?
nothing .
i just saw you staring at his butt when you handcuffed him . who said it's okay to talk to me like this?
he's pretty cute for an old fogy kind of guy .
he just needs a shave .
okay , folks .
show's over .
move along .
night , sam .
nothing to see here , folks .
you don't have to go home , but you can't stay here .
honey , give it a rest .
it's so late .
it's almost midnight .
you told me to finish the job .
i'm trying to actually finish the job .
let's give zekie his snack and go to sleep .
where is zeke? well , he's just ...
don't tell me he went into the dry wall again .
i was meaning to get a grille .
they don't have the right size ...
you were gonna finish remodeling this place .
over a month ago .
i don't think you know what you're doing . we'll have to give zeke cat food , and he hates that .
god forbid a cat should have to eat cat food .
that cat is spoiled rotten .
if he was a kid , we'd send him to military school .
poor zekie .
let's lie and say it's tuna .
okay .
you won't trick him .
he's smart .
zekie doodle .
look what we got for you . we got tuna .
get your furry cat ass out of there !
zeke .
what's going on?
oh , my god !
she's divorced now , you know .
i don't want to talk about sam parker right now .
man in a flea circus don't wanna itch , but he still does .
something on your mind , gladys?
i know why you left town 1 0 years ago .
i left for a lot of reasons .
you wanted to avoid telling sam why you beat up her husband .
that was a long time ago .
i'm a changed man now .
prove it .
march down to sam parker's and tell her everything . why you broke her husband's nose . why you left town without so much as a fare thee well .
and tell her once and for all how you really feel about her .
lose the face fuzz before you do .
makes your mouth look like a stripper's crotch .
that's disgusting .
hello?
hey , pete .
what's up?
<i> can you talk? </ i>
i can talk .
what's the matter?
<i> something ate zeke . </ i>
what?
<i> he got in the dry wall . </ i>
something ate your cat?
oh , my god .
what do you think it was?
unbelievable .
how is emma taking it?
well , she left me .
she's gone to stay with her mother .
i'm so sorry .
<i> you okay? </ i>
i'm fine .
<i> you sound like you're crying . </ i>
no , no .
i just ...
i have an intolerance to dairy .
i'm just a little bit mucousy right now .
that's it .
sam , i need to tell you something .
it's bret .
i'm gonna get it .
wait .
hang on a second .
come here .
i'm worried about things you've been doing lately , ash .
this bad girl thing you're going through could get you in trouble .
i have something that i want you to keep with you , okay?
i really don't want to do this now .
just a sec !
i'm a man .
you're a woman . what am i doing?
take this .
protection .
is that a stun gun?
are you kidding?
i knew guys like bret at your age .
mom , i'm not you , okay?
i'm not gonna get pregnant at 1 6 .
i'm not gonna stay here for the rest of my life and be a trailer trash sheriff !
thanks for the flashback .
i didn't deserve that .
i'm sorry , okay?
i'm really sorry .
can i have the stun gun , please?
be careful with it , all right?
okay .
thank you .
get out of here .
oh , it's you .
i was wondering if your mom was home?
mom !
it's for you .
morning , chris .
morning , sam .
i wanted to come by and apologize for yesterday .
i can handle wade .
don't worry about it .
great .
and since i'm back in town for a little while ... ... i thought maybe i could ...
sam ... ... before i left ...
is there something you wanna tell me?
do you think we could ... ... meet somewhere?
hook up?
not hook up .
i mean , meet somewhere and catch up on things?
sure , chris .
we could do that .
great .
all right .
i'll be in touch .
okay .
who are the flowers for? well , they're for you , actually .
i picked them myself .
nice .
nice .
all right , bye .
picked them myself . come on .
joshua?
there's no sign of joshua ... ... his parrot ... ... or any of the arachnids .
just these huge , intricate webs they've left behind .
i've discovered several arachnid tracks outside .
from my initial estimate , the spiders have doubled .
no ... ... more like they're five times their original size .
i found this map in my dad's study .
leon , is this the section he was working on when he died?
i thought so .
i want to concentrate all our energy in these tunnels here .
those mines have the highest concentration of methane gas .
i'm not gonna make the same mistake my dad did .
i want all men to wear masks at all times .
if you feel disoriented , get to a higher chamber as soon as possible .
it's nice to know you didn't forget everything we taught you .
can you give me a ride into town?
sure .
hop in .
great , thanks .
what's that?
i think it's an exoskeleton of a male orb weaver's pedipalps .
okay .
it's a spider's leg .
that seems awful big to be a spider leg .
that's the problem .
but nobody's gonna believe me .
believe what?
do you really want to know?
try me .
my friend joshua sells spiders .
they've been growing bigger and bigger .
now they've broken out of their cages and headed down to the mineshafts .
joshua is nowhere to be found .
they might've killed him .
but you won't believe me .
i'm the kid .
they never believe the kid .
let me see it .
it does kind of look like an old piece of cactus .
see?
so ... ... where were you?
i went to joshua's .
what did i say about that?
his spiders are gigantic !
the town could be in danger .
they could destroy everything !
people could get killed .
just hear me out .
i swear to god it's the television .
this is exactly your problem , right here .
i don't want to hear any more of your media induced nightmares .
mom , listen to me !
add a week to how long you're grounded .
please .
and no tv .
i know , i thought it was a slam dunk . who knew chris mccormack would suddenly get gold fever?
i'm trying my best here .
do you know what people would do if they knew ... ... we were storing toxic waste without their consent? wade , i'm going out now .
now , look .
i let you guys run tests ... ... putting that stuff in the mines under my property .
i'll be back late .
you owe me on this .
going off to get wasted , have an orgy .
might steal a car , want one?
bret , i'm on the phone .
go have some fun .
i'll see you later .
we stand together or we fall together .
thanks for caring , man .
i'll do what i can .
what the ...?
good lord .
<i>i've been warning you for years , </ i> <i>but you wouldn't listen . </ i>
now it's emerging as a trend in our sleepy little town .
the police wire says bob stuck's dog skippy's missing .
it's the fourth missing pet call we've had today .
it's strange .
it's strange .
people are saying it's coyotes , it's wolves .
but we know the truth . we all know about those cows and the probe .
the anal probe .
let's talk about the probe .
let's talk about the anal probe .
what is that? what are they looking for?
that's just wrong .
skippy didn't do anything to anybody .
he doesn't deserve that ! what will you find in a dog's ...?
it's just wrong !
<i>you're all ostriches with</ i> <i>your heads in the dirt . </ i>
<i>which just leaves your ass</ i> <i>up in the air ! </ i>
<i>you're inviting the aliens in !
they</ i> <i>have no choice but to probe your butt . </ i>
aunt gladys , how can you listen to this wacko?
i think he's very informative .
do floyd and leroy still have that barbershop?
good idea .
people are talking .
you can't light those matches?
maybe it's a sign to quit .
<i>if the aliens come</ i> <i>and try to anal probe me ... </ i> ... i m telling you , i'm not taking that !
if you want a piece of me , don't take that piece !
so how much is a shave these days?
four bucks .
four bucks?
it's a good deal .
got to give a good deal . can't charge around here what a barber can charge in other places ... ... where they got money .
and jobs .
of course , some people don't know a good deal when they see one .
maybe i don't need a shave .
hold still .
i wouldn't want to cut you .
bret , slow down .
i thought you loved me .
i do .
i do .
but , i just ...
but , what?
i don't want to lose my virginity in the front seat of a truck . why didn't you say so?
i got a blanket in the back .
no .
that's not it .
i just don't think i'm ready .
tammy and larry do it every night .
fine , call them .
have a mnage trois if you want .
that dirty talk just drives me nuts .
bret , no .
bret , please .
i'm warning you , okay?
i can't help it .
you just bring out the beast in me .
back off !
my balls !
god , my balls !
damn it !
i pissed my pants !
don't you think you're overreacting?
i was just copping a feel !
overreacting?
i can't believe my mom was right about you .
do you have any idea how embarrassing that is?
ash , wait .
i'm sorry !
check out bret .
let's go !
they're coming . come on , let's go !
get on your bikes !
dude , did you piss your pants?
we gotta go .
they're coming !
looks like the only thing going is you , dude .
holy crap !
they're getting closer !
move it !
we have ostriches , cats and dogs disappearing all over town .
<i>last time i checked , cats and dogs</ i> <i>are not fish . </ i>
<i>and ostriches farmed are not game . </ i>
there has to be somebody at fish and game who can help .
hey , watch it !
yes .
what the hell are these things?
here we go again .
the phone lines are down .
they'll tell you it's a technical error .
but you know what it is .
they're shutting us down !
i know what you're saying to yourself .
he's paranoid .
he's crazy .
just because i'm paranoid doesn't mean people aren't following me .
<i>all of a sudden there's</ i> <i>a communication blackout . </ i>
at the bottom of the bag .
it's where they always put the food .
here it is .
here we go , bruisie .
bruisie?
bruiser?
aunt gladys?
bruiser?
oh , my god .
oh , lord .
are you in there?
oh , my god !
i'm coming , baby .
i'm coming .
aunt gladys , i lost the face fuzz .
bruiser?
aunt gladys?
this ain't no cactus .
mike !
mike !
sam !
can i talk to mike?
why?
i can't explain now .
look what i found in my basement .
that thing is huge !
give me a second !
hold this .
what's going on?
so check this out .
after taking careful measurements of the exoskeleton i found at joshua's ... ... i calculated the spider was the size shown here .
what spider?
the hole in the basement was bigger . what hole?
let's input the measurements from your exoskeleton and see what happens .
that's more like it ... ... unfortunately .
what the hell is this?
it's my media induced nightmare .
oh , god .
so you're telling me a giant spider ate gladys?
maybe not .
was there webbing around?
yeah , lots of it .
she might have been attacked by a male orb weaver . what's the difference?
males compete for the female by bringing her presents .
the prey is cocooned alive so she can feed on it in her nest .
women like breakfast in bed .
so gladys might still be alive?
that's ashley !
come on !
look out !
keys .
keys , keys , keys !
mike , get out of here !
throw me the scissors !
scissors?
scissors !
here you go !
sam !
help !
hey , spidey !
thank you .
<i>pete !
come in , pete . </ i>
hold on to your shirt .
is that you , sam?
i don't know what's going on , but the phones are down .
i know .
take the weapons and get to my house .
guns?
why would we be needing ...?
just do it !
okay .
all right .
okay .
winchester , 30 . 06 ... ... mossberg pump ... ... and the lee harvey oswald rifle . why we have that , i do not know .
<i>why don't you stomp them hills out</ i> <i>and get some room to grow ... </ i> <i> ... before you start making brags ! </ i>
<i> brags , is it? </ i>
i'm closing up .
you're always talking at me about something . can you turn that thing down?
you're already deaf from it .
i said , turn that thing down !
what did you say?
bob?
first emma leaves , now sam's got me doing spring cleaning . can't get any worse .
so , what happened with you and brian anyway?
he wasn't exactly the faithful type .
i've been trying to tell you this for a long time ...
you can handle one of these , right?
ashley , mike , you guys ready?
just a minute , mom .
how many spiders did joshua have?
i don't know .
1 00 , maybe 200 .
two hundred?
are you kidding me?
hurry up , guys .
time to go .
joshua's spiders are nocturnal hunters .
they're coming out to feed .
we have to warn everybody .
the phone lines are down .
<i>to spread the word , </ i> <i>to look into the dark places ... </ i> <i> ... our government controlled media ... </ i>

what was that?
what the ...?
what the hell is going on?
it's pete .
he's waiting . come on , let's go .
see you , ash .
i don't think that was pete .
oh , my god .
holy moly !
everybody get in the car , now !
ashley , go !

i need to make a broadcast .
you can't oppress me ...
show me how this thing works . consider this a government conspiracy to take over your station .
here .
friends ... ... our local authorities have ... ... an emergency message for our little community .
this is sheriff parker .
i have an important announcement .
pete , turn on the radio .
<i>this is not a prank or</ i> <i>one of harlan's crazy stunts . </ i>
<i>we have a crisis situation</ i> <i>on our hands . </ i>
the town is being overrun by giant spiders .
i know how this sounds , but you must trust me on this .
i want everyone to arm themselves immediately .
giant spiders are all over the town .
did she just say giant spiders?
that's just harlan's show .
giant spiders?
what the hell kind of bullshit is that?
aliens you believe , this you have a hard time with?
why didn't someone say something?
look at me .
god .
i gotta warn sam .
no !
noise will just attract it .
what should i do?
give me the walkie talkie !
mom , are you there?
yeah , mike .
is everything okay?
<i> don't make any noises . </ i>
there's a giant tarantula headed your way .
copy that .
oh , my god !
they're here !
you're just food to that thing !
attention , people .
everyone meet at the prosperity mall .
the prosperity mall !
why the mall?
concrete walls , steel doors .
<i>did you see that thing? </ i>

go !
come on !
can i get a refill , carol?
help yourself , sweetie .
that was an excellent ostrich burger .
well , thank you .
kind of slow today , huh?
it's always slow here , wade .
there's no way you're telling me that thing back there is from earth .
all right !
they're spiders from mars .
you happy?
no .
it's the invasion !
i'm telling you , it's the invasion !
i told you !
everyone , just get to the mall as quick as you can !
<i>get to the prosperity mall</ i> <i>as soon as possible . </ i>
arach attack .
if you build it , they will come .
get everyone inside and get the gate down .
kids , go with him .
oswald's gun .
this is the weirdest day of my life .
what is going on?
look behind you !
how do you lower the gate?
key .
do you have it?
yeah .
hurry up !
okay .
that's the back gate .
the lavatory .
come on !
you're making me nervous !
i'm making you nervous .

mom , are you okay?
what exactly is that?
spider , man .
how's the lock down holding?
this one's pretty good .
they're holding , but we don't have much time .
okay .
all the doors are locked and secured .
no breaches out front .
i haven't heard a sound .
i think the doors will hold .
someone ought to get back there ...
go . we have a right to know what's going on !
those things killed leroy .
bob miller , my best customer , was hanging from my ceiling . what am i doing on the radio?
i've been telling you about the invasion for months .
am i talking to myself?
i'm here for you .
you saying those things are aliens?
you're not listening ...
mom , they have to be quiet .
those were big ass spiders !
really big ones !
shut up !
let's listen to the kid .
for once .
go on , mike .
first of all , the spiders are attracted to vibrations .
loud noises , movement and talking .
so everybody needs to stay as calm and quiet as possible .
why didn't you call in the army?
where have you been , wade?
the phones are dead .
does anyone have a cell phone?
use mine .
you have to climb a mountain for a signal .
use the antenna on the mall .
that's how i get my broadcast out .
have someone climb and get a signal .
that's a great idea .
be a hero .
i'll do it .
no , sam .
let me .
i got your back .
great .
i've fought aliens my whole life .
about time i busted up a few of them .
face to face .
they're not aliens .
they're spiders !
those of you without weapons , arm yourselves ... ... with anything that you can dig up .
then we'll meet back here .
norman?

i always wanted to try one .
can you lead these people out of here?
you bet .
come on , everybody !
let's go .
this should hold him .
i hope .
how do we get out? we follow the power lines to a generator .
they're always near an exit .
come on !
not that way .
hurry !
this way .
follow the kid !
hurry up !
you went back for that?
lose that thing .
it'll slow us down !
this saved my ass so many times today !
what's that smell? wasn't me .
methane gas .
a lot of it .
listen up !
the slightest spark or an open flame can blow us all to hell .
so be careful .
let's go . cables lead to a generator .
follow the cables . cables . way to a generator .
you guys !
it's this way !
follow the cables .
the cables lead to a generator .
follow the cables .
norman !
somebody save him !
no gunfire !

it will set off the gas !
catch !
come on , hurry !
into the tunnel .
follow the cables .
let's go !
people , hold on !
what the hell is this?
what's going on?
i don't know .
that spider back there , was that the female?
no .
that was just another male .
the female is three times as big .
so she's probably still close by , right?
yeah , i'd say so .
go back with your sister .
go back with your sister !
why are you here?
mom sent me .
why?
you don't want to know .
we have to do it .
it's the only way out .
oh , my god .
what the hell?
what is it?
i think it's alive .
don't touch it .
don't ...
it's wade .
bret , just go , okay?
just go .
let's get him down .
wade .
i don't feel so hot .
hold on a second .
look at the size of that !
what the hell is this place , mike?
it looks like an orb weaver den .
get us out of here .
i can't .
why not?
is there a chance that gladys is still alive?
it's possible .
are you crazy?
you'll have to get out without me .
follow the wires .
there's a shed outside with a generator .
start it quickly .
what are you up to?
i got an idea .
i get it .
everybody , come on .
follow the cables .
this way .
come on .
bret , i'll need your bike .
my bike?
just do it .
all right , kids , come on .
leave it there .
i've been trying to say this for a while .
now?
yes , i may not get another chance .
i should've said this a long time ago .
i know .
you beat up my ex because you found out he was cheating .
you couldn't tell me because you didn't want to break up my family .
and you've always loved me .
and if you'd said something , maybe our lives would be different .
exactly .
your father told me .
my dad told you?
now , get moving so you can make it up to me later .
go on .
that was easy .
gladys .
this way .
follow me .
come on .
breathe .
you're alive .
you look like an angel .
all that gold .
gold?
right behind you .
the agua mesa lode .
he found it .
we need to find the generator .
mark , get everybody away from the mines .
hurry up .
get away from the mines .
get up there .
mom , what about that one? come on .
i knew he wasn't crazy .
what are you doing?
no , no .
no smoking . we gotta get out of here .
stand back .
shoot it !
shoot it !
i'll set off the gas !
i can't !
get back .
mike , you saved us .
i need this more than you .
damn it .
why isn't it working?
it needs fuel .
see?
all right , find gas tanks .
anything you can find . we need gasoline .
hurry !
hurry !
what are you doing?
it'll set off the gas .
hurry !
all the gas cans are empty .
we just need one electrical surge .
keep looking , everybody .
don't give up .
here , will this work?
ashley , you're a genius .
switch .
put this on .
mom , it worked .
<i>adis , </ i> consuela .
fire !
aunt gladys , are you okay?
not my mall .
not my mall .
not the mall .
please , not the mall .
i hope the insurance pays for this .
let's go !
let's go !
i thought you said 91 1 didn't believe you .
they didn't .
they listen to my broadcast . we never miss a show . we drove from tucson .
it sounded like you needed help . where are the aliens?
how many times do i have to tell you?
they're not aliens , okay?
they're spiders who grew because they ingested toxic waste .
that's a more believable explanation .
i had to drag that barrel out of the water .
i got covered in it .
and your point is?
point?
see this?
all brand new .
brand new growth .
check it out .
brand new .
are you all right?
do you smoke?
no .
good .
dangerous habit .
disgusting .
causes explosions .
wish i'd never started .
any more people down in those mines?
my aunt was the only one alive .
i checked the other cocoons , but nobody made it . we got cocoons !
told you it would be worth the ride !
glad you came back home?
yeah , i am .
me too .
that is the story of how the aliens attacked our sleepy town .
to this day , people refuse to believe what happened here .
they'd lead you to believe i would embellish this story .
but we know the truth .
two things i forgot to tell you .
they never did get that probe near me .
as far as chris mccormack reopening the gold mines ... ... and putting everyone back to work ... well , that , my friends ... ... is another story altogether .
