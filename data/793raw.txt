deep in the hundred acre wood where christopher robin plays you'll find the enchanted neighborhood of christopher's childhood days this is one of my favorite once upon a times , although i'm not quite sure which time it was once upon .
but it had been so nice and summery in the hundred acre wood , and the sunshine was as warm as a blanket .
and the streams were gurgling happily .
as happily as a tumbly full of honey ... ... which is very happy .
but all that changed when ... ... the stranger came .
honey .
honey .
oh !
oh !
oh , bother .
oh , d d dear !
oh , my !

ah !
huh?

all excited to go out already?

mama , did you hear that sound?
what sort of sound , dear?
i don't know .
it was sort of strange .
and kind of neat .
oh , the bother ...
did it sound something like that?
no , mama .
that's a pooh bear .
good morning , pooh .
what?
oh , well , uh , good morning , roo .
i wish it was .
a good morning , that is .
why?
what happened?

many strange things .
oh , dear .
i'm sorry , roo .

oh , bother .
oh , d d d dear .
oh !

pooh !

help !

quick , rabbit !
help !
all right .
uh , what?
thank goodness you're all right .
it came at me !
i heard this neat sound .
terrible .
what's this all about?
it chilled me to the bone .
i was asleep .
something like ... ... this .
one at a time !
thank you .
now , what is going ...
me !
pick me !
me , me , me !
tigger?
there i was , sleeping , dreaming tiggerish dreams .
and suddenly everything starts shaking .
and there's stuff falling everywhere .
and then it stops .
and i look around .
and there it wasn't , my most " favoritest " family portrait .
it was clean gone .
did it look something like this , tigger?
yeah , it was ...
actually , it had a little less pooh in it .
i see .
and , uh , pooh bear , what about you?
well , whatever it was , it ate my honey .
oh ...
and ...
aw !
well , actually , i ate my honey .
but it made me do it .
humph .
i was asleep in bed , and i heard this neat trumpety sound , and ...
thank you , roo .
very good .
now , piglet , tell us what happened to you .
actually , i i i'd like very much to forget .
well , what we have here is a mystery ...
wow ! ... of the most mysterious kind .
hey , everybody .
look what i found .
it's a swimming pool .
the sky has finally fallen .
always knew it would .
oh , m m m my !
it looks like a footprint .
that's " impossibibble .
a footprint , indeed .
anyone can see it's only a ... a ... a ...
rabbit , what sort of creature do you suppose would be attached to a foot that ... ... big?
there's only one thing it could be .
a heffalump .
excuse me .
what's a heffalump?
what's a heffalump?
everyone knows what a heffalump's like it's got fiery eyes and a tail with a spike claws on its paws are sharp as a tack and wing a ma things coming out of its back
out of its back?
of course , roo .
precisely .
exact tickally .
its bottom is up and its top's really down so its nose is its tail or the other way 'round yeah , and it's wide as a river and tall as a tree
imagine gigantic  and times it by three
it clomps here and there  it stomps to and fro
got three horns above  and eleven below
those are its good points  there's much more to know about the dreadfully dreaded thoroughly three headed horribly hazardous heffalumps
wow .
neat .
neat?
it's most certainly not neat .
everyone knows they lurk and they creep the best time to see one is when it's asleep if you sneak up behind it and get it to jump you can tell which part's heffa hee hee and which part is lump they'll steal all your honey and eat your last crust stomp on your house till it's nothing but dust the worst part of all is
they're different from us?
they're the dreadfully dreaded thoroughly three headed fiercely ferociously mostly atrociously horribly hazardous
heffalumps
yeah !
and they live right over there .
heffalump hollow .
oh , oh , d d d d dear !
i know .
i know .
let's go get them .
capture a heffalump?
ha ha .
impossible .
besides , it's never been done .
then we'd be the first to do it .
it'd be fun .
it'd be an adventure .
it'd be ... ... an " expotition .
hmm .
hmm .
yes .
well , now that i think of it , it would be a first .
mm hmm .
oh , yes .
the first heffalump expedition in history .
oh , splendid idea .
glad i thought of it .
of course , capturing a heffalump is a perilous affair .
meticulous planning is called for .
but how does one capture a heffalump?
how , you ask?
it's quite simple , really .
come back with your equipment and i'll show you how it's done .
humph .
woo hoo !
ohhh !
all right .
let's see what everyone's brought .
hoo hoo hoo !
has anyone brought anything useful?
i brought some rope .
rope , yes .
my thought exactly .
thank you , roo .
you see , a simple piece of rope if the most effective device for capturing heffalumps .
now , everyone together .
aim at the barrel and say in a firm voice ,
in the name of the hundred acre wood ,
i capture you .
in the name of the hundred acre wood ,
i capture you !
and toss .
brilliant .
in the name of the hundred acre wood ,
i capture you !
whoa !
i did it !
i did it !
i'm gonna capture a whole bunch of heffalumps .
come on , everybody .
let's go get them .
just a moment , roo .
a heffalump expedition is fraught with danger .
but we gotta go catch the heffalump .
roo , you just can't argue with a word like " fraught .
but i really want to go .
it's too dangerous , roo .
you're simply too young .
you could get hurt .
but i ...
roo !
time to come home !
roo , dear !
you mean i can't go?
i'm ...
i'm sorry , roo .
roo !
coming , mom .
oh , don't be sad , roo .
i i i think you're very , very lucky .
all right , everyone , we'll meet here tomorrow morning for the grand expedition .
and rabbit and tigger are quite sure heffalumps are so awful?
and everybody's gonna catch one but me .
it isn't fair .
oh , i'm sorry , roo , but there will certainly be other adventures you can go on .
i'm grown up enough to catch a heffalump .
aren't i , mom?
you're growing up very fast , indeed , dear .
faster than you think .
do you think i could grow up by tomorrow morning?
so soon?
why?
then i could go on the " expotition .
you know , dear , growing up doesn't happen all at once .
it takes its own time .
but i need to grow up now .
well , then , how about starting with a good night's sleep ,
little mister roo?
little mister roo
reaching for the moon so many things you've got to do
and no time for dreaming
little mister roo
let the stars shine over you don't grow up too fast too soon
save some time for dreaming
settle in , settle down let me see that sleepy yawn on your face
close your eyes i will love you completely and always little mister roo the moon shines silver over you no one knows you like i do
and little mister roo reaching for the moon don't grow up too fast too soon
do you want your nighty light?
no , thanks .
i don't need it anymore .
good night , sweetheart .
good night , mama .
i just know i could catch one .
ahhh !
hoo hoo hoo !
ah !
ah , yes .
a perfect morning for catching heffalumps .
it's very brave of you to join us , piglet .
especially since it's so very dangerous .
well , i thought of hiding under my bed , pooh bear , but i'd rather be hiding out here with all of you ... ... than under my bed , with all of me !
now , now .
we've gathered the best minds to the task .
namely my own .
we simply can't fail .
right you are , rabber rific .
with tigger's heffalump tracking skills , it's a fate a complicated .
with courage , cunning , and superior tactics , we'll be home by teatime .
oh , i hope so .
behold .
heffalump hollow .
home of the dreaded heffalump .
oh , my .
i believe that what's over there doesn't look quite as friendly as what's over here .
fiddlesticks and nonsense .
there's nothing to be afraid of .
hmm .
there you go .
see?
rabbit didn't get gobbled up .
yet .
hmm !
okay .
hoo hoo hoo !
hoo hoo hoo !
well , would you look at that .
i didn't get gobbled up either .
hoo hoo hoo !
yet .

so far .
ha !
now to teach those heffalumps a thing or two .
ready !
forward , march !
no time to lose chin up , tallyho we'll never stop till those heffalumps go the best heffa quest you'll ever know they're the dreadfully dreaded thoroughly three headed horribly hazardous heffalumps the dreadfully dreaded thoroughly three headed

he's great .
and there's this little pig monster that squeals and shakes all the time .
and it will get you if you don't watch out .

you're wrong about piglet too .
he wouldn't hurt a fly .
and then there's this loud thing , and it's got long ears .
and he yells at everybody .
yeah , you're kind of right about rabbit .
but he's okay once you get to know him .
i don't want to get to know him .
