children , look at this map , the black mark of which , must be erased .
you hide it with your little fingers and you mark it with red .
then , whatever it may happen , promise to go and find ... ... the children of alsace who are spreading their hands to us .
let the green branch of hope to blosom in our beloved france .
blossom from you , dear child .
grow up !
france is waiting for you !
to rip the map of every trace of germany and of the hun ... ... we must exterminate that race , we must not leave a single one ...
heed not , their children's cries they slay all now , the woman too ...
or else some day they will rise which if they're dead , they cannot do .
we have one and only enemy , who is digging the germany's grave .
with a heart full of hate , gall and envy ...
we have one and only enemy , who raises his murderous hand .
you know the enemy's name .
it's england .
this is it !
war has been declared !
well little brother , are you gonna spend repainting statues?
i put you down to that list too !
in two days , we're all leaving for basic training in glascow .
at last something's happening in our lives .
well?
are you coming?
two minutes yet mr .
sprink .
i have been ordered ... ... to read this message from our beloved kaiser .
this is a dark hour for germany .
our land is besieged .
and we must brandish the sword .
i hope ... ... that god will give us strength to use it well ... ... so we can resheathe it with dignity .
two minutes yet , lieutenant !
we're going out .
the german trenches are 100 meters away .
we're bombing their machine guns for more than an hour .
that's good for us .
we pass their first line and then the farm which is behind .
the 134th will replace us tonight .
so we can get some rest .
the scots will cover us from the left .
you'll recognize them from their black caps .
don't worry about them , you'll only pay attention to what i say !
i'm like you !
i want to go back to my home as well !
so let's do what we have to do , and in one week we'll be back home for christmas .
let's do what has to be done !
prepare your bayonets !
load your rifles !
let's go !
don't stay here .
someone of us survives .
don't stay here .
no william ...
no william !
come on !
come on william !
i abandoned him ...
like a coward ...
i abandoned him ...
i let him die ... all alone ...
you had no other choice .
and now we must pray for him and for all the other casualties .
the reinforcements arrived ...
we're leaving dale ...
you stay here with the rest of the wounded ...
i'll see you back in base ...
i know you're in the trenches father ...
it's andrew duncan ...
i'm not far .
father , i'm eight feet away .
the others ... the others are too far away but me ...
father , you've got to come over to help ...
that's it .
just walk , straight ahead and you'll get on top of me ...
i knew ...
i knew i could count on you father .
what the hell are you doing?
this is a suicide !
don't run !
don't run off like that , darn you !
come back ...
come back here !
cease fire !
he was the stretcher bearer !
what?
you shot the stretcher bearer !
how do you know that?
why did you shoot first?
it was a scotts marauder , sir .
i think i got him !
good .
stay put .
with the slightest move , sound the alert !
yes sir
sprink ...
come with me .
yes , lieutenant !
attention every one .
leave the enemies weapons in the main trench !
go help them .
allright .
we have to rebuild it .
don't worry .
none saw me .
did you get hurt?
what happened?
you were for barely 15 minutes in the trench .
reinforcements didn't ...
their machine guns annihilated us .
i lost a third of my men in 5 minutes .
you saw the scots retreat on your left and you left the farm .
did you learn anything new?
i tried the red cross but nothing ...
impossible to get news from the enemy zone .
information say , the germans are treating the civilians good .
your wife must be at her parents ... with the baby ...
during the bombing , one of our cannons exploded .
5 of our men and an officer died instantly .
i asked for you to replace him in that unit .
artillery is good .
you'll move up fast .
no .
i don't want the artillery .
i'll stay here with my men .
find another lieutenant .
there are many .
i am the major general here and i rule according to what i feel right .
you'll do what i tell you to .
you'll make christmas in your unit .
then you'll go to poitiers for training .
that's an order .
if you want your visit to remain secret , you better leave .
my orderly is coming soon .
you'll stay here for 3 days .
then you'll move in first line to the delsaux farm .
that sector should be quiet for christmas .
get some rest .
i'll see you before you leave for poitiers .
goodnight .
goodnight , general .
lieutenant , i found you some blankets for tonight .
what's wrong lieutenant?
my wallet ...
i lost my wallet ...
the wallet with the photo you showed me the other day?
yes .
what a shame ...
but you don't need photos to remember your wife .
i had a mishap as well .
take a look , lieutenant ... 2 centimeters higher , and i'd be dead !
it's still ringing !
unstoppable , like me !
right lieutenant?
in the briefing it says we put one every 5 meters .
every five meters?
so , how many?
about 100 . 000 .
or 20 trips with train for lille via brussels .
incredible !
christmas trees !
it will take longer to send these trees in front ... ... than it would take to send our cannons .
let miss sorensen in .
how is he?
he's fine .
his regiment got attacked four days ago ... ... but they pushed back the enemy .
now , about your proposal ...
i'm afraid ...
i can't accept it .
i feel that , as a dane , you can't understand how serious the situation is .
for 5 months now , 2 million of our men are fighting without pause .
we have neither the time nor the urge to organise a recital .
it took me a while to understand ... ... that i approached the wrong person .
the heir , who saw me , was delighted with the idea to have ... a recital at his headquarters on christmas eve .
i was told , you are responsible for the cannons and the convoys ... ... and also the soldiers .
so if you would kindly sign here , next to the heir ... ... before you inform your men .
you'll only see him for a night .
what's the point of that?
it will be much more than one night .
our minutes are longer than yours .
mother , william and i got your package and your letter ...
thanks for the mittens and the mufflers .
it's so cold here , they're most welcome .
the thought of you at home nice and warm , keeps us good .
thanks for the cake too .
i hope we'll have some left for christmas eve ...
your two sons ... who love you .
good morning father .
three cases of whiskey .
that's a lot of ammunition .
i presume i'm invited?
my men are completely exhausted .
we're all tired gordon ...
every single one of us .
i can bring you no relief before three days .
and if the germans do attack tonight or tommorow as its suggested they would .
we'lljust have have to deal with them .
yes sir !
our valiant stretcher bearer !
you're the one who nearly got one of his own men killed in no man's land .
the stretcher bearer is supposed to save lives .
not endanger 'em .
i gave orders .
very clear orders ... ... that it's forbidden to leave these trenches in case of a german counter attack !
yes sir , but the situation ... but , you don't give a damn !
now i suggest you drop the st. bernard act in future ... ... and never forget , something called military discipline !
is that understood?
do you understand?
perhars you wanna tell me what you're doing here in the front line in the absence of any combat .
i was visiting a friend ...
what?
a friend?
where do you think you are?
your local parish?
now you'll return with me immediately to the back line .
come on man !
make yourself usefull for once .
sir .
this way's shorter .
we move up here , we take a right through the clergy area ...
this way?
get me out of here , will you?
i'm sorry we have to go through the clergy sir ...
christ !
what a bloody fucking mess .
just get me out of here will ya?
yes sir .
absolutely sir !
shut up , will you?
as a priest im used to the silence .
that's enough .
what's going on?
nothing .
just a rifle shot .
it's dead calm .
good .
be carefull , they won't stop even on christmas eve .
follow me .
do you know who's brilliant idea that was?
no .
that's for you lieutenant .
sprink ...
you'll be leaving us ... for a night .
to go where?
home , in a way , where you'll be better .
why do you dislike me lieutenant?
after your regiment was disbanded , i had to take you .
but i prefer masons , bakers , farmers .
artists like you arejust a waste , nothing but a millstone .
now go .
the officer will take you .
come on , get moving !
10 o 'clock and nothing is done yet .
take it easy there .
isn't that too short?
i told you lieutenant , i'm the best barber in lens .
even the may or was coming to my store .
and henri hennebicque?
was he your customer too?
hennebicque?
doesn't sound familiar ...
he was my father in law .
deputy may or .
lives at 21 cypress street .
you never told me sir .
i know cypress alley well .
i went there several times to get my bike fixed .
at narcisse denoyelle , number 43 .
i can see it right now , a little blue gate .
i think i can tell you now ...
sometimes , at nights , i'm heading to the road towards the farm .
slowly , so i won't get killed ... and i sit there ... and i look ...
i know the delsaux farm pretty well .
i was going there with my bike to get eggs and milk .
just bey ond the farm is the road to lens .
straight to lens .
on foot , i'd be back home in less than an hour .
with no rush ... one hour ...
my mother would wait for me at the door ... with a cup filled with hot coffee , just like before ...
i'm done lieutenant .
i think i'm done .
well?
there's no mirror in front?
christ how stupid am i?
but i got you a great haircut sir , you're ready for the party tonight .
if you say so ...
welcome miss .
my pleasure .
miss sorensen , its a pleasure .
i will not tolerate mistakes !
clean it up right now !
where is nikolaus sprink?
i think he arrived an hour ago .
sprink?
the tenor?
miss , we owned this house for 300 years now ... ... but its no longer our home since september 23rd .
ask somewhere else , if you can .
if they have any taste , they will put him in my room ... ... on the top floor .
you poor thing ...
good taste ...
prussians?
you shouldn't even talk to these people !
no ...
i have lice ...
we'll sing together again , just like before .
i'm not like before , anna .
sing for me .
sing for us .
your highness .
i'm glad to see the war didn't affect you .
your volunteer as a private ... ... impressed me .
i am not a volunteer your highness .
i was called like every one else .
i congratulate you for your initiative , miss .
you reminded us , that despite the war , it's christmas .
thanks to you and your voices ... ... tonight i'll feel like i am in berlin . ... where i hope to return as soon as possible .
perhars next spring ... if everything goes according to plan .
next spring !
do you smoke?
every one smokes in the trenches .
you have to kill your time in any way possible .
it's five years today , since the day we met ...
in oslo ... ... five years passed already?
you have to flirt with death to realize how time flies away .
that's a terrible thing .
all these fat and sated men , parading and drinking champange .
i have to return to the front ... to sing for my comrades , tonight , more than any other time .
for months i was trying to make this true , and you want to go?
i don't want to leave you ... but i must go and sing for them .
i'll return after that .
i'll come with you .
no way !
it's too dangerous .
you can't imagine how much .
since the time you left , not even a single second passed ... ... without me wondering if you're still alive .
you are alive .
and i am with you .
nothing else matters .
i was waiting this night for very long .
i don't want to lose a single moment .
and without my pass from the kaiser you'll not go that far ...
you got a pass from kaiser?
the major general places his trust on you .
couldn't they leave us quiet on christmas eve?
we always have to do the dirty work .
i volunteer to go .
i don't want trouble , gueusselin .
go there , approach their lines , locate theur machineguns and return .
understood?
and if they see me with this moonlight , can i return fire?
go , be discreet and come back fast if you want a hot meal .
hey lads .
where did you get the pipes?
from the guys of the 92nd , they learnt we're doing christmas here .
any spare seat there?
froggy land .
come on father , give us a song .
play " i dream of my home " .
rosbif land .
looks like they're having fun there .
would you like us to have fun as well?
this is anna sorensen .
good evening .
are you crazy , and you brought a lady here?
lieutenant , i convinced the heir ... ... that a little music wouldn't do any harm .
good .
you can start .
lieutenant !
come and see .
something weird is happening .
i don't like this lieutenant .
could be a diversion for some dirty trick .
get down every one !
good evening , englishmen !
good evening germans ... ... but we're not english , we're scottish .
it was very nice , but that's enough .
this is not berlin opera .
you're right .
it's even better than berlin .
look at that .
a meeting and we're not invited !
shut up ponchel .
what the hell is going on here?
good evening .
do you speak english?
yes ...
a little .
wonderfull !
we were talkin about a ... a cease fire ... ... for christmas eve .
what do you think?
the outcome of this war won't be decided tonight .
i don't think any one will criticise us for leaving down our riffles on christmas eve .
don't worry .
it's just for tonight .
what the hell are they doing?
maybe the germans are fed up and want to surrender .
i would be surprised ...
ponchel , give me a bottle of champagne and my beaker .
merry christmas .
who's the idiot who did that?
merry christmas .
good evening .
i'm anna .
you first .
felix .
where have you been?
his name is not felix .
it's nestor .
he's nestor , the cat from the delsaux farm .
i know him better than you .
nestor's is going to the french side .
my wife .
she's a pretty girl .
very .
this is my wife .
montparnasse .
it's my wife's favourite part in paris .
the luxemburg gardens .
by the way , you didn't show us a picture of your wife .
uhm , like you i had a photo of her but ...
i lost it .
i've draw her face but ... that's not really the same .
do you live ... on rue vavin?
yes ...?
i think i ...
i found your wallet in the trench .
i kept it because of the address .
a little hotel on rue vavin .
i spent a week there with my wife , two years ago .
it was our honeymoon .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
hold on , thats gueusselin's bottle .
who cares .
he went to sleep .
i would be surprised if he did .
thank you ... very much ... sirs ...
it's good !
how many month's pregnant was she on that photo?
five months .
she was in lens , at her parents , last july .
she had complications and had to stay in bed ...
i asked to stay with her , but i couldn't .
i was called to go to war , and had to leave her there .
but ... don't you write each other?
how is she?
i had no letter from her since september .
they never make it here .
i don't even know if it's a boy or a girl .
hey scottsman .
you know what i got here?
the french gave me some champagne .
do you want to drink?
sing for us .
sing for them .
