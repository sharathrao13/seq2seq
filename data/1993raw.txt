slugs
six , six , six .
six , six , six , six ...
that counts .
johann , i've been thinking .
where you work ... they spend tons on pr , right?
so let's do a commercial for the post .
it's not called post anymore , now it's called telekom .
wrong , the post is ... still in charge of mail & phone calls .
who still calls from the post?
the commercial is done , but we say ... we're a creative young team ... with a great idea .
give us an office for 3 months ... with internet and everything else , and we'll design ... a revolutionary new ad concept .
if you're not happy , pay nothing .
sure , they do it all the time .
they're not risking a thing .
that's 3 months of ... surfing , games , and free phone calls .
plus they'll want our commercial too .
'cause it's brilliant .
rats .
wanna know how it goes?
i rolled a six .
black background .
3 seconds long .
coming from left ... midway down the screen , you see in yellow the word " post , " and right afterwards ... the same word again , and again ,
post , " " post , " " post " ...
the text runs from left to right ... across the screen .
and you hear a male voice , sonorous but young , saying , " post , post , post " ...
blows your mind , doesn't it?
it'll be the start of a whole new craze .
on the streets people will wink at each other and say : " post , post , post .
you could at least mention it to your pr manager .
sure thing .
i'll talk to him first thing tomorrow .
yeah , i mean , it doesn't hurt to ask .
it's a terrific idea .
yeah , but you said you'd talk to the pr manager .
y'know , about the commercial .
yeah .
post , post , post , yeah .
it'll work for sure .
yeah .
post , post , post ...
i imagine how you look still half asleep ... as you drink your coffee at the breakfast table .
how you bend forward and reach for the butter , and your bathrobe slips .
i imagine my hand between your legs , how nice and warm it is here ... in your little nest .
has anyone ever written back?
leave me alone , i've got a headache .
wildbach .
funny .
gerhard married a girl from there .
oh yeah?
he was my best friend in grade school .
we sat next to each other for 4 years .
julia loibnegger .
bet she's dying to move in with you guys .
ok , put it back now .
we are but tiny stars born of a cosmic bang .
what's that supposed to mean?
here , look .
it was singing so pretty just now .
i got a few 100 grams sausage .
i need you to come pick it up , make cold cuts ...
answer the phone .
hi .
it's 60 for the house sausage .
i'm out of caramel , but i'm getting some fresh raider next week .
i'll let you know next time .
and i'm not the bank , ok?
you know how much you owe me?
you'll get your money , don't worry .
seppi?
are you jerking off?
don't call me seppi .
you do know that that's not the answer .
i don't care .
what are you thinking about?
could it be ... that you wrote another letter?
what?
i imagine you in the morning ... as you drink your coffee .
thanks a lot .
i lost it .
you really turn me on the way you butter your roll .
hello .
hello .
do you take credit cards?
you want a receipt too?
very funny .
come in .
forget it .
smart girl .
a true professional , i like that .
honey , i'll be right back .
i don't need any dope at the moment , turns your brain to mush .
but i hear you're ... interested in films and whatnot , and that you know that scene .
where'd you hear that?
not important .
i might have something for you .
a video , see?
fuck off .
with boy and girl students .
with sex and whatnot .
amateurish is ok , like a home movie , just let the camera run .
i'd be the producer .
what did you have in mind?
well like with intellectuals , you know , who get together and say smart stuff ... and screw each other .
but nothing lame .
with blow jobs ... and bare asses and juicy stuff like that .
that's what folks wanna see .
forget it .
let's have your 100 .
is that ganja?
normally i'm the ganja man .
i can't believe you don't know a couple of guys ... who just think about porkin 'all day .
hey , isn't that martha over there?
didn't you make out with her at mao's party?
yeah , a little .
who's that geeky teaching major behind her?
beats me .
old becomes new .
now that can't be .
new becomes old , marie .
warm becomes cold .
and now should cyberspace replace your dear grandson?
a keyboard wet with tears of woe .
where did all the people go?
go on , she's just playing hard to get .
i could sure use some pussy again .
i've been thinking the same thing .
we don't get the kind of regular sex we deserve .
i don't know .
why does some geeky 30 year old think i'm sexy ... and not the 20 year old babe?
teaching major chick would have gone to bed with you .
i'm not that hard up .
i was a teaching major too for a while , but the way she was dancing ...
yeah , no way .
i mean , so wild and uninhibited , but at the same time totally uncool .
we've got more important things on our minds .
like how to make sure that in our next life ... we don't get reborn as ourselves .
you wanna split a kebab?
business is going good?
it's ok .
how's it going with you two?
i play soccer every once in a while ...
i've seriously been thinking ... about quitting my job at the post office .
changing shifts so much ... makes my head spin in the afternoon .
so what's your plan?
i'd like to do something creative .
dance instructor maybe , huh?
lambada classes for swinger couples .
there's an untapped market .
or we could make a porn flick with you as stars .
very funny .
that'd be something creative .
it's what you men always dream about .
you can count me out .
did someone buy box wine?
mr. cheapskate strikes again .
i think we should have a good story ... with credible characters and real emotions and entanglements .
and what i like are the mix ups .
you know like someone slams the door of a hotel room ... and the nine turns into a six .
i don't know .
we're making a sex film not a jerry lewis comedy .
i think the intellectual side has to ...
it's gotta be realistic , y'know ,
like in the george michael video at the ski lodge ... where they have a blast and everyone screws everyone .
except for with us it's summertime .
i think the best stories are like real life .
students go to the countryside to study for an exam ... hoping it'll improve their concentration , and then ... everyone fucks everyone .
in between they drill each other and quote aristotle and stuff .
where's the story?
they flunk the test .
oh , real life , just more intense ...
and more stimulating : " friction fiction .
we may call it fiction , but that doesn't mean we can't really do it in the film ... just so the people watching can lean back and say ,
it's just a movie .
like the gorgeous female character ... who appears in the male character's ... fantasy sex scene ... that turns out to be just his dream .
but she really was naked in the movie .
and in reality too .
during the dream sequence shoot .
i think we should cheetah some alcohol .
what?
i think we should cheetah some alcohol .
i see , meaning what?
i'd like to cheetah a little alcohol tonight .
it doesn't mean anything .
it does so .
then where does this come from , to cheetah alcohol?
obviously from cheetah .
the animal?
akin to leoparding .
i don't know , i think she's lion to us .
you're using it as a verb .
that's crap .
it really does exist .
i swear .
she's leopardizing our friendship .
that's a verb .
there you have it .
of course .
i assume this works with every animal .
i mean why not giraffe a pint or camel a six pack?
or we could apple or orange ourselves silly .
you get 3000 up front , i'll throw in some ganja , that'll take care of expenses .
you get the rest when you deliver .
how do i do a whole porn flick on 3000?
that's just for starters .
look , if things work out ... and it sells well ,
i'll give you a cut .
you let me down , though , you got a problem .
there's some milk left ...
roger .
and thanks .
have a safe trip .
the bike isn't too sturdy , i'd rather ...
let's go , reini .
first vienna wet pussy raffle .
hey , an orgy where you wear paper bags with faces drawn on them .
incredible .
you want this one too?
who are we balling anyway?
we'll be casting the female roles .
and i'll be directing , as non playing captain .
now i get it .
you wanna play director .
directrice .
max , leave the dildos alone .
c'mon we're outta here .
ciao .
bye .
see you later .
max , let's go .
listen to this dialogue .
mashed potatoes still good?
mao is absolutely right .
if these idiots can earn money like this , so can we .
look , what's so hard about that?
and you don't care if mao's making all the decisions?
the main thing is to get the job done and collect .
and mao's the right person for that .
with my share of the money i'm going to mallorca .
i'll learn how to kite surf and get drunk every night .
and when i come home , i'm gonna start a new life .
say what you want about porn flicks , but they kick ass when it comes to names .
see , gina wild , for instance .
teresa orlowski , that's hot , man .
shouldn't we be thinking of male names?
oh brother .
i mean , for example , clit eastwood ...
he sounds like a hermaphrodite .
what about boris pecker?
he's got enough problems .
but the beat all of names is ...
phil mydick .
he's for real .
it comes from feel my dick .
you get it?
i know what you mean , but seriously , what about joe meat?
joe because my name's johann ...
i like joe meathead better .
give us a call and stop by .
politeness . " ok .
check moaning skills .
suitability .
i'm not sure about that one .
what?
that's a key point , you dork .
we have to see if they really want to do it .
alright ok .
if you want , we can scratch " politeness " ... and replace it with " cleanliness .
hey , it's important to me .
and how did you want to monitor that?
yes?
sabi .
what?
sabine .
and this is johann , my partner , or joe .
i thought i'd try anyway .
can't you read , we're only casting women .
do i have a chance?
my parents are so fuckin 'stingy , it drives me crazy .
i don't know how i'll get through the summer .
be in our film .
i'll cancel your debts and you can earn some spending money .
shit , i should be studying for my entrance exam .
it's your call .
well , mara .
what makes you think you're right for this job?
i just know it .
is this really so important?
i had group sex on my high school graduation trip .
no problem .
i'm very generously endowed .
it's her .
i know .
it's her , i'm positive .
should we go over our lines?
what?
were we supposed to learn them?
the scene where i drill you .
i'm at the kitchen table holding the philosophy book .
watch the road .
wow look !
it's an old pub turned into a whorehouse .
stop , i think i need a drink .
nothin 'doin '.
that feels so good .
sometimes i need to work up a sweat .
sitting at the desk all day makes my muscles and bones ache .
then we cut to the stationary bicycle , right?
gimme that letter .
i imagine how you look ... still half asleep ... ... drink your coffee .
... butter , and your bathrobe slips .
i imagine my hand between your legs , how nice and warm it is in your little nest .
what does that mean little nest?
we are but tiny stars born of a cosmic bang .
what's that supposed to mean?
this crap turns you on?
turn right .
are you kidding , it's on the left .
no , the right .
i ought to know where my parents live .
drive carefully .
people have died on this road .
calm down , there's nothing wrong with the way i'm driving .
there it is .
there .
i'm allergic to schnbrunn yellow .
yuck , all over my car ...
roll down your windows .
i don't believe this .
why didn't you say something .
gross .
turn off the windshield wipers , fat lot a good they're doing .
hold on , mara .
i'll deal with it later .
are you still nauseous?
you know how much this call is costing ...
hi , can you hear me?
hi sweetheart .
when did you get there?
the weather's lousy , tomorrow should to be nicer .
it's already clearing up a bit .
remember to lock the door to papa's room .
you know how he is .
and also ...
i have to tend to things , ok?
motorized windows .
they're worthless , always broken .
where'd you get this place?
reini's been working on it for years .
where's the tv?
locked up .
that's off limits .
this door stays shut .
shit .
they're only slugs .
garden slugs .
yuck , you guys are so gross .
this is so disgusting .
they're all over the whole lawn .
how can i act here?
i'm not lying down ... until it's cleaned up , is that clear?
it's not a lawn it's a yard ...
get a bucket and collect the slugs .
normally you pour beer on them , huh?
what a waste though .
or you use ducks .
just the indian runner ducks that go upright .
they can't fly , huh?
yeah , selective breeding .
now all they do is eat slugs .
up to 150 a day .
i'd like my own room .
tough luck .
i don't bite .
you think they're a delicacy?
if there's this many , they can't be a delicacy .
a delicacy is uncommon & special .
in that case i'm a delicacy too .
per day we need at least an indoor ... and an outdoor fuck or oral sex scene , plus one lesbian scene , and we'll be done by saturday .
i'm marika , an exchange student from serbia .
i'm so unexperienced in studying ,
i can't wait to bone up with the boys .
whether from the front or the back ...
i read every book from cover to cover .
was that ok?
i study law .
this is my 18th semester .
i've invited a few friends to my house .
we'll be studying for a mighty tough exam .
i wonder ... how this twitching in my testicles ... will affect my studying .
my name is joe .
i study philosophy and this is my 12th semester .
our young study mates ... are eager to learn ... and simply dying to start cramming with us .
i'm sure we'll be delving deeply ... into some very stimulating subjects .
i've been thinking about our parts .
and the sports student ...
the sports student still isn't clear to me .
i can't relate to her .
what do you mean?
well , to me she's this introverted character ...
for being introverted she sure goes all out in aerobics .
it suits you though .
that's totally irrelevant here , ok?
my character gives head too , but if you suck dick the way you drive , you're gonna make everybody puke .
is this girl mental or something?
let's talk about this like adults .
i bet she's never given a real blow job .
my god , she's so crude .
i wish i'd known this before .
in the next couple of days you have the chance to earn 2000 each .
i think that's reason enough to get along .
who wants some more goulash?
i bet condoms look lame on film .
are you crazy?
you can catch something so easily doing porn .
they said they're clean .
they're young .
i believe them .
really?
hi mara .
graduation trip .
group sex .
herpes , syphilis , alds .
you're insane .
chancroid .
gonorrhea .
who do you like better?
martha or mara?
that's something professional porn stars never ask themselves .
you just take things as they come .
this feels so good .
sometimes i need to work up a sweat .
sitting at the desk all day makes my muscles and bones ache .
sitting at the desk all day makes my muscles and bones ache .
our bones are aching too .
i'll show you a workout that will really pump you up .
i'm burning to start , on fire like an olympic torch .
well maybe after all this studying we should have a little fun .
what do you think , marika?
what kind of car is this , georgie?
a corvette .
it's not just a corvette , it's a philosophy .
i'm a philosopher myself .
and you wouldn't want to lose it?
harry , i need this car .
in my business , image is everything .
i can't drive a micra mouse .
you don't pay , you don't drive anything .
harry , i give you my word of honor : in 2 weeks you'll get the rest of your money , or i'll return the car myself .
you knew the conditions .
your corvette is history .
you can't do that .
cause and effect .
it's like the flap of a butterfly's wing .
what's with the flap of a butterfly's wing?
can honor produce an effect?
listen .
i am listening .
tell me what your concept is .
i've got something killer in the works .
nothing half baked .
it's tight .
tight?
yeah , it'll work out .
whatever .
i need a partner .
i can feel it in my bones .
i'm talking wampum .
what's in your bones?
y'know , loot .
moolah .
dough .
silver .
a treasure trove .
let me swallow your torch .
don't look at the camera .
and besides that's my line , and it goes ...
let me swallow your fire .
can we get on with it?
no , i can't work if she doesn't know her lines .
redo the lines afterwards .
no , we're not post dubbing this .
smarty pants .
i have to agree with mara .
john doe from smalltown ... won't go into a porn shop ... asking for titfuck parade instead of ...
thirsty ladies in negligs for the soundtrack .
is that an erection?
hi george .
no , you're not disturbing , we're doing a shoot .
what?
3 days?
that wasn't the plan .
unexpected complications .
whatever .
you're not cutting corners , are you?
don't worry , it's under control .
it's choppy , too many holes in the dialogue .
bad timing .
i gotta go .
it's not that hard .
max says " torch , " you strip , and he fucks your big dialogue hole shut .
i'm not fucking next to you , you slut .
is she whacked?
get off there , you brats .
i'll blow you away .
i'll blow a hole in your heads ... so the blood shoots out the front and the back .
all day and not a single scene we can use .
too stupid to fuck .
then do it yourself , if you're so smart .
i don't need porn to fuck .
or friends either .
i can do it myself .
she doesn't need friends?
c'mon , mao , hansi , stop being silly .
don't call me hansi .
see ,
i told you it was a harebrained plan from the start .
shut the fuck up , you spoiled bitch .
hey max .
great party .
now she's really snapped , the retard .
are you crazy?
say that one more time , say it .
say it again .
retard , retard ...
stupid bitch .
if it's embarrassing or you don't want to do it , then we'll stop , ok?
i promise .
i have the feeling i'm about to get my period .
then you don't have to fuck .
it's like in gym class at school .
let me just go fix my makeup , ok?
way to go .
excellent .
fantastic .
keep it up .
fuckin 'ay , man .
great closeup .
good , martha .
you're both doing great .
do you know this one?
i know a magic trick .
the woman says , " alright , let's see .
the man says , " it's easy .
get down on your knees and suck my dick ,
and afterwards vanish into thin air .
i am so thirsty .
get her a drink and then we'll get started .
great job .
bring the chocolate too .
i've got one too .
a princess comes up to a pond , sees a little frog , and thinks ,
how cute . " so she says ,
if i give you a kiss ,
will you turn into a prince?
frog says ,
no , that's my brother , me you gotta give head .
this round's on the house .
cheers .
it won't make us blind , will it?
it's only good if it burns .
how do you make a woman scream twice?
first you fuck her in the ass ... then you wipe your dick on her curtains .
that was a good one .
totally stupid .
let's get back to work , ok?
martha blow job .
i feel sick .
i need to lie down on the sofa .
what's wrong?
you stoners , see what happens?
she's snoring .
sound asleep .
let's carry her inside .
i told you to go easy on the hash .
are you kidding .
this is the alcohol .
hash doesn't get you sick 'cause it makes you eat .
mao is a strange name .
my real name's maria .
but reini thought that ... as a baby i looked like mao tse tung , and it stuck .
what do we do with her now?
we fuck on the sofa .
anita , come down , this is wild .
no reini , please .
you come upstairs .
it's so far out .
here's to a wonderful vacation .
cheers .
same to you .
does mao have a boyfriend?
there's probably someone .
i hope it's not one of those two turkeys .
definitely not .
i think she prefers women .
nonsense .
she's never brought a boyfriend home .
me either .
crappy music .
we should have brought our own .
i think it rocks .
my old man and his records .
what's wrong?
don't you like your dad?
he fights the system from the inside out .
subversive to the core .
and we allegedly ruined his revolution .
he has a fit if mom talks on the phone too long .
where did they go for vacation anyway?
a communist castle .
run down , but cool .
and no tv .
his way of punishing himself ... for earning too much and building this place .
you're not serious .
sweetie .
i love you .
i have a hard time fucking just anyone .
i don't mean that as an excuse because ... the girls are really sweet ...
but with you and me , we're already a team .
or how should i put it?
you and me , we could be something magical .
you know?
i mean , it's already there .
i like you a lot , really , but i'm going to sleep now .
can i spend the night here anyway?
max , please .
we were pretty drunk .
your normal graduation trip .
and do you do this ...
i mean , have you done this a lot?
shit , i should use a condom .
it's too tight .
you have to wait till you're hard .
yeah , i know that , but it's not easy with you on top ...
then i'll be on the bottom .
did you know we made out once?
of course .
well?
well what?
yeah well , didn't it mean anything to you?
i don't know , i guess it was ok .
i mean i was pretty drunk .
and now?
actually , i'm pretty drunk now too .
hey ...
what?
i'm not sure if we're on camera .
don't worry .
we're fine .
it's close enough .
you can't see us .
sure you can .
it's fine .
i want to stop .
stop .
stop .
stop .
stop , you asshole .
hey , mara , i'm sorry .
it's been 2 years since i had a girlfriend ... and half a year since i had sex .
please forgive me .
you know what?
we'll erase it , ok?
i'm really sorry .
shit .
i don't believe it .
the bitch .
i should have known .
maybe she just went to the next farmhouse .
to get milk .
should we go look for her?
it's a 3/ 4 hour walk at least to the next town .
and she stole my makeup case too .
what?
what a lousy , rotten thing to do .
can you lend me your kajal?
mara , i'm sorry about last night , honest .
i just wanted ...
it still happened , didn't it?
want some?
about last night ...
i dunno ...
it's ok , but now let me think .
you gotta help me .
or this won't work .
please .
see if i care .
we've got a deadline , and we still haven't filmed anything remotely usable .
much less a closeup or a cum shot .
we haven't filmed absolutely nothing .
what did we film?
the lesbian scene won't be a problem anymore .
why not?
i'll be back in an hour .
where are you going?
what's going on?
c'mon george , pick up the phone .
look a butterfly .
i don't see anything .
there , a butterfly .
a butterfly has 12, 000 eyes .
you know , butterfly comes from flutterby , so it means to flutter by ... and not a fly that likes butter .
life insurance is another funny word , or earwig .
i mean , it doesn't come from ear or wig .
this might sound silly now , but ...
i liked you from the first time i saw you during casting .
i thought it would pass , but it didn't .
funny .
we've slept with each other , but this is the first time we're really talking .
good morning .
is the boss around?
no thanks , we've got enough girls .
no , it's not that .
we need a girl .
miss , we're not open yet .
sometimes i write letters ... with no return address , to women .
and i image them opening them ... and reading , and their jaws dropping , not literally , of course .
it's kind of like hide and seek , except they can't find me .
i've never told anybody that .
not even max .
once some guy called me for three weeks ... every single day ... and babbled nonsense .
he didn't tell me his name either .
mostly he didn't say anything .
and besides , how should i put it?
what do you mean by we?
we need?
all of us .
all of you .
or someone else ... who needs something , if you know what i mean .
we want to borrow a girl for a movie ...
we might not get her back .
i've got money .
so do i. good day .
bye .
george , can you help us find a new girl?
what?
what's wrong?
martha ran away .
the specific identity of their renegade cunts ... doesn't mean beans to me .
the exact names of your bitches ... don't mean a fart to me .
what?
you aren't making sense .
listen , by saturday i need the video ... with what you've filmed so far .
do they understand?
i'm afraid that's not possible .
or they won't get a cent .
or you won't get your dough .
it can't be that hard .
others have gotten the job done .
i agree , it can't be that hard .
end of discussion .
julia ,
i imagine you reaching across the counter ... and handing the no .
2 wrench to me on the ladder , still sweaty after tearing the plastic packaging ... off our new wall to wall bookshelf .
and then i imagine your skirt slipping open ... and i ... work your hot nest with my plane iron until sparks fly .
you can read it yourself .
hello , mrs. schreiber .
good morning , mrs. loibnegger .
then you are from our village?
you wrote me the letter .
loibnegger , julia .
oh .
how funny .
i always imagined you completely different .
i'm just passing through .
breakfast in my bathrobe .
the warm nest .
yeah , yeah , i know .
why do you do this?
i didn't know it was you?
it was a coincidence .
no reason .
it's always the same letter .
but i don't know that .
i thought the letter was for me .
that's mean .
really mean .
it wasn't anything personal .
look at me .
i'm not disappointed .
i just pictured you different .
i always compared you to gerhard , and i just thought ... you were somehow special , that's all .
sorry .
you need more confidence , it was a nice letter .
really nice .
you're so beautiful .
i love you .
you're my wife .
we are but tiny stars born of a cosmic bang .
a cosmic bang .
what's going on here?
he's really getting into it .
that's the best you can come up with?
i think this is cool .
yeah well .
at least he's putting up a fight .
other people just know how to talk big .
oh .
and yourself?
you just know how to spread bad vibes , right captain?
get changed .
wait .
i'm about to come .
you look great .
what are you thinking about?
c'mon , don't make it more complicated than it is .
i've imagined sleeping with you so many times ... but somehow ...
then think about something that turns you on .
what are you thinking about?
a phat slimy frog .
can you two try not saying anything?
you're a little too heavy .
ok , turn on the camera .
give it to me .
do you feel me?
i feel you , this is so sexy .
just do it .
i can't .
have you ever noticed ... that all your names begin with " m "?
martha started with " m " too .
really weird , huh?
hey , what's the big idea?
how does it feel?
it sucks .
georgi , what's all this?
tickets .
you've speeded through every radar in town .
i've got a fast car .
how would it look if i drove like a dead snail?
are you really as stupid as you look?
the corvette is mine .
you're 10 installments behind , tickets out your ears .
i bet you don't even drive anywhere .
oh yeah , well that's a dirty lie .
where do you drive when you're out driving?
places , y'know .
appointments .
yesterday i bought me this jacket .
with fringe .
killer , huh?
jacqueline says i look like a young johnny winter .
that's not the problem , georgi .
you're a sweetie , but you gotta learn to manage your money .
last chance : drive to the house ... where they're shooting and get that treasure trove .
you're the producer , think of your image .
you can do it .
sometimes , georgi , sometimes everything works out in the end .
hello .
i behaved like a total jerk , and i swear i didn't want to ruin everything .
i'm really sorry that we lost a whole day because of me ...
really .
do you have my kajal?
and now what?
i dunno , we have to try a different approach , totally different .
i think i know how .
is anybody scared to do this?
yeah , me .
ok , but why if we all want it?
i'm not completely sure , inside .
then why are you here?
well ...
not because of the sex .
then what?
because of the money .
it's for the money , so ... if we fuck , we get money ; if not , nothing .
so you're saying , we have to think differently ... and say , " money equals fucking , " is that it?
if money equals fucking , then we just fuck .
no more thinking .
we do it and get paid .
we have to get out of this thinking mode ... and into the action mode instead .
that's what i think .
i don't see what the problem is .
you're making things more complicated than they are .
it's so strange , if you say it's no problem for you ,
i can totally see doing it with you .
i mean doing this with you .
because it's like ... you're scared the other person might have a problem with it ... and you become the problem yourself .
take dogs , for instance , with them it happens twice a year : in the spring and in the fall it's mating season .
the dog knows he's got a job to do and that's that .
and that's why it's so hard to shoot doggie porn , they're only horny twice a year .
on the contrary , doggie porn would be easier ... because you know come spring , come fall , when it's time to do it , they can do it .
i think it makes a difference ... if you're an animal or a human being .
humans think about their drives constantly and animals don't .
i wish i could turn off my brain for once and just go all out .
you mean with a woman?
if one person is having fun , if he's totally into it and he completely lets go , the whole group starts to believe in it too .
an awesome feeling .
and that can be ... so intense you forget everything .
look , what are we fighting against here?
we all want it more or less , right?
yeah .
well , yeah .
yes .
yes we do .
we just have to get rid of the " more or less , " right?
in other words , our problem is that we're humans ... and not primitive animals and we're uptight about fucking .
what we yearn for is a state ... where we don't care .
back to a ... primordial herd fuck state , the sexual primal soup .
look , if we could just forget everything , and regress to a primitive animalistic ... throbbing mass of bodies ...
i'm not filming .
why are you doing this , huh?
why are you fucking him?
do you need it?
i thought you liked women .
what's your problem?
everyone just slept with everyone .
but that was for the movie .
i thought that was something special .
you want me to film you?
this is what we all yearn for , the primal state where nothing matters .
and nothing matters .
you said so yourself .
stop it , max , get lost .
shut up , i'm not talking to you .
ok , then fuck .
i'll get it on film and we'll sell it .
we won't get rich , but we had fun .
go on , go ahead and fuck .
fuck .
what don't you understand?
that we're fucking without you?
that we didn't ask your permission?
what's wrong?
move in with us so you can cook for him .
stop it , ok .
we can go shopping again like a family .
stop it , you idiot .
johann doesn't really mean anything to me .
oh yeah?
and if he did , would that be so bad?
i'm in love with you .
come on , you don't believe that yourself .
seeing you two was too much for me ...
you were too much for me .
i fished it out .
come back you little chicken shit .
shit .
i can't understand you .
this can't be happening .
don't scream at me .
that son of a bitch .
you're not getting anything from me .
who's she talking to?
listen , we've got a minor crisis ...
don't tell me to listen , you listen to me ,
i've had it up to here with your crisises .
i'm coming by to look at the tapes .
calm down , george .
calm down .
i'm the producer and i want a screening .
it's bad timing .
bad timing?
you know what i'm doing with your bad timing?
look .
you see this?
is he dangerous?
i have no idea .
i'll blow your bad timing out your ears .
beaver ranch
no .
please , please no .
this can't be happening .
from da front ...
swallow it da back ...
da front ...
da back ...
swallow it swallow it ... swallow it swallow it ...
... da da da torch .
swallow da torch oh yeah .
this isn't happening .
what am i gonna tell harry?
what am i gonna tell harry?
sorry about the movie .
what movie?
and about mara too .
yeah , alright already .
hey mao ,
i realized something else .
oh yeah?
there really are cheetahs .
i saw it too .
what does mao do for a living anyway?
'cause she's spending a few days vacation at home .
she just said they wanted to relax ... and then study for an exam .
hope we don't disturb their study session .
don't worry , i get along with young people .
johann , i was thinking ...
max , back off , ok .
for once just leave me alone .
i don't care how many cheetahs you guys see .
ok , it's all the same to me .
it's just too bad we blew our chance .
yeah , no kite surfing in mallorca ...
no , i mean the movie itself .
lots of people have made porn flicks , but there are lots more who haven't .
did you want to show it to your grandchildren?
see what a stud grandpa was?
but look , that's not grandma .
no , i'm serious , max .
you and i are two vain peacocks coming home empty handed .
when the peacock spreads its tail , the asshole comes out .
once an asshole , always an asshole .
the porn industry reflects our neoliberal ...
do you two mind shutting up for once?
just until we get home , ok?
don't you understand?
it was a '68 corvette ... with more extras than you can imagine .
you'd never see them on a factory model .
tires out to here , spoiler , a heated driver's seat ...
let's go .
my kidneys get cold really easily , y'know?
and ... double shock absorbers .
and i tell you it purred ...
like a keith richards solo .
then it was high time .
what do you mean by that?
c'mon , get in .
it's not funny .
some things you don't joke about , ok?
but johann , i'm totally convinced ...
i don't care how many pigs you see .
i told you guys to shut up .
no way .
hey , what about me?
six .
yes .
six .
no way .
the 6 is gone .
we could take a train .
you got money?
no .
six .
me either .
we could hitchhike .
it's your turn .
six , six , six ...
no .
nobody's ever stopped to give me ride .
screw you .
i'll explain it once more , ok?
nice and slow .
i always say , " don't think small , think tall .
you gotta think big .
small investments don't pay off .
you're always the idiot .
are you saying i'm an idiot?
no , i mean in general , you're always an idiot if you think small .
so you did call me an idiot?
no , you're not listening .
you're right , i am an idiot .
you're not an idiot .
yes sir , i'm a complete idiot .
you're not a complete idiot , ok?
a regular idiot .
not a regular idiot , you're not an idiot at all .
what an idiot .
good morning .
are you folks done?
i'm george , i'm the producer .
good morning , pusterhofer .
morning .
i own the beaver ranch .
meet glory and bessie ...
say hello .
last night while i was walking i had a great idea .
key word : alternative healing .
no matter what , people are always going to be sick .
sick people are the biggest target group .
and those are precisely the people ... my commercial is aimed at .
live long and prosper .
did someone just stop?
no idea .
all is quiet in tense anticipation .
a huge audience stares up at an empty balcony .
out comes spock .
he gazes out at a crowd of earthlings ... in the middle of the 21 st century .
chi gong and prosper .
the crowd cheers and applauds wildly .
i mean , it's absolutely brilliant .
or think : retro .
play pong and prosper .
give bong and prosper .
it's brilliant , isn't it?
