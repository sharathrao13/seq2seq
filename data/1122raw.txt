ana , something happened to ama .
what happened?
i don't know , come and talk to her .
estela , i always have to do it , you go .
she wants you , not me .
ana's here , ama .
buenos dias .
hello , grandpa .
say something .
mama?
who is it?
it's ana .
mija , come closer .
i'm really sick , you'll have to make breakfast for the men .
breakfast?
mama , can't estela do that?
estela has a lot of work at the factory .
mija , i woke up in the middle of the night , soaking wet .
it was like i was on fire .
okay , mama , what's wrong?
is it your legs?
si .
what about your back?
si .
and your head?
yeah , that , too .
and how's your hearing?
what?
today's my last day of high school , i'm not gonna miss that .
ungrateful .
so your pain is gone?
i struggle with it , just like i struggled to give you birth ... and raise you and take care of this family .
yes , it hurts !
i didn't ask for you to give birth to me , okay?
that's enough .
estela , what's wrong with your sister?
come and help me .
okay , seven years at m. i. t.
four years at stanford .
four years of teacher's college .
i'll continue my education , too .
i'll backpack through europe , and ...
ana , hang on a minute .
what's happening with the college applications?
i'm not going to college .
what do you mean?
you're a smart woman with something to contribute to this world .
my family can't afford college .
there are scholarships , grants , financial aid ... everything we've been talking about all year .
mr. guzman , i'm really sorry to have to say this ... but you should probably spend your time helping somebody else .
now , i have to go , but ... you were the best .
thanks .
thank you , come back again .
i've been waiting for this day .
yeah , me , too .
here's your uniform .
just give me my check , okay .
that's sick .
i was keeping it warm for you until you got here .
you know , you can always just kiss my ass to get your job back .
anita .
come .
what?
don't ask why .
just come , i need to show you something .
all right .
come on , hurry up .
coming .
okay .
congratulations !
congratulatlons ana
thank you , cousins .
all the happiness , ana ...
grandpa ... ... for many years .
look at your big cake .
cake?
oh , my god .
can't you see she's bigger than the cake?
why did you quit your job?
why do you know about this?
i just know .
okay , mom , i quit my job .
why?
i didn't get along with the manager .
so what?
you're just gonna have to get another job .
i know , papa , okay?
it's just something i had to do .
tomorrow you come to work with us in the factory .
what?
no way !
estela , we're very far behind .
we're not behind .
yes , we are .
if we don't help your sister , who else is going to?
i don't know , and really , i don't care .
why do you have to say that?
because it's true .
estela stays up all night trying to finish those dresses .
papa , i can't afford any more help .
that takes care of that .
if estela cannot pay ana , it doesn't really help us .
she'll pay .
fine , i'll pay her .
she can iron .
end of discussion , senor .
who wants cake?
i want some .
a big one .
take a small one .
mr. guzman , what are you doing here?
are your parents here?
yeah , but i told you ...
ana , who is it?
good afternoon , sir .
ma'am .
i'm luis guzman .
i'm ana's english teacher .
i speak english .
i'm sorry .
ana's an excellent student .
i'd like to see her continue her education , go to college .
mr. guzman , of course we want ana to get educated .
we have already discussed that amongst our family .
but we need her to work now .
she can go to college later .
senor garcia , ana's a very special young woman .
she got into beverly hills high school ... which isn't easy , and now she can go further .
there are all kinds of scholarships .
i'm sorry , mr. guzman ... but tomorrow morning she goes to the factory ... to sew , with us .
may i ask you , mr. garcia , just to please think about college .
i'll think about it .
i'll talk to my wife .
let's go , anita .
i told you .
she doesn't do her chores ... she doesn't clean her room , she doesn't do laundry ... she doesn't cook ...
she gives me plenty of trouble .
carmencita .
ana doesn't give you that much trouble .
look , her teacher ... is very happy with her .
if we make an effort ...
i believe we can help her get into college , to get an education .
i can teach her .
i can teach her to sew .
i can teach her to raise her kids ... and take care of her husband .
those are things they won't teach her in school .
it's all right , she can get married later .
are you not listening to me?
it's a matter of principle .
it's not fair .
i worked since i was 13 years old ... and ana is 18 years old .
now it's her turn .
she has to work .
my life is over .
you're so dramatic , just like ama .
excuse me , but i'm nothing like mom , okay?
whatever you say .
oh , my god .
don't even think about it .
you'll never fit into that one .
it's a size 7 .
why do you always have to be like this?
i only tell you for your own good .
look at you !
enormous !
don't !
they must weight 10 kilos each !
mom , what do you think you're doing?
you're so dramatic .
good morning , mrs. carmen .
good morning !
good morning , normita .
good morning , panchita .
mrs. carmen , how are you?
very well , thank you .
normita , you must be in love .
you look so fancy , i hardly recognized you .
my fiance bought me this dress .
yeah?
it's beautiful .
just wait .
that happened with my husband , and then he stopped buying me clothes .
maybe it was your fault .
why would it be my fault?
just look at you .
maybe the material got too expensive .
envy or charity?
like my grandmother used to say , " there's no better dressing ...
than meat on bones .
and you are not going to make me cry .
you go ahead and cry , panchita .
i'm going to the bakery .
are you a new worker?
this is my daughter , ana .
are you going to be working here full time?
no .
i'm just helping out my sister until i find a better job .
me , too .
i'm just working here until i win the lottery .
mujeres , this is my daughter , ana .
you know , the one i always complain about .
mommy , she's mrs. carmen's daughter .
i can't believe you finally made it to the factory .
yeah , what took you so long?
i had a meeting with a supplier , but that's none of your business .
this is dona carlota .
this is an overlock , which makes hems .
she's a pro .
welcome , i hope you like the job .
and this is pancha and her machine .
we already met .
don't touch anything that belongs to pancha .
she really gets upset , you'd think it was her baby .
that's not true .
it is true .
this is another overlock machine .
norma does the work , and she's very fast .
i'm carlota's daughter ... and these are my sisters , lupita and angelica .
and this is rosali , the troublemaker .
and this is ama's station .
these scissors are yours .
don't lose them .
everything gets lost in this place .
come on , let me show you your job .
pay attention .
ama , are you doing your work?
yes , my general .
watch .
we do high quality work here , okay?
that's why i get the orders .
it's so hot in here .
can't you get a fan?
we have a fan .
you know that the fan blows dust on the dresses .
always use the steam , okay?
and please don't burn the tulle .
okay .
okay , it's real easy work .
and always check the level of the water and let me know when it gets low , okay?
so i can send you out to buy some more .
when you're done , you put the dress here ... on the bagger , you put a plastic bag over it ... and you put it on that rack for me , okay?
if we work hard today , we'll finish these .
that'll be one hundred in size 7 .
did you hear , mrs. carlota?
we're close to 100 .
what a beautiful dress .
we take the finished dresses to the distributor and then start on size 6 .
how much do they pay us to make these dresses? $18 for assembling each .
and how much do they sell them for at the stores?
they sell them at bloomingdale's for $600 .
we make them for $18 , they sell them for $600 ... does this seem right to you?
just work , okay?
i don't think she knows how to do anything .
i don't think she'll make it , and with her mother here ...
she's so arrogant .
i have chisme from the market .
mommy , mrs. carmen has gossip .
i love gossip .
you should be working !
el dorado ortiz ... is secretly in love with rosali .
that's horrible .
that dirty old man ...
looks like a shriveled up mango .
el dorado ortiz is in love with rosali .
he thinks you're too skinny , but he would love ... to fatten you up .
but don't get as fat as ana .
ama , we have to work now .
yes , my general .
you burned it !
ana , can't you do anything right !
where are you going?
you little brat .
wait !
come here !
don't make me come after you !
ana !
what's going on here?
this is my mom .
is this your daughter?
yeah , this fatty .
my daughter .
knock yourself out , ladies .
where are you going?
where the hell are you going?
i can't take it anymore .
i'm too old for this .
i don't know why i'm working .
my hands have arthritis .
and i'm going blind from so much sewing .
yeah , mama , i know , okay .
everybody knows .
leave !
if you want to leave , leave !
what?
am i embarrassing you?
are you ashamed to work with us?
so much effort , so much sacrifice ...
and all for what?
for you .
you only think i'm a beast of burden .
ama , come on let's go .
let's go back , come on .
oh , my god .
hold onto me .
come on , we're gonna go back .
you have to help me .
come on .
you behave , okay?
how cute !
look at yourself in the mirror .
good morning .
good morning , gorgonia .
how did you sleep?
okay , and you?
how do you think , with my arthritis?
i see you have a new saint antonio .
that's for ana .
and how many years have you had this one hanging here?
that one ...
eleven years .
i put it up on estela's 18th birthday .
i'm gonna take it down .
no !
leave it there .
who knows , estela could still get married .
it's too late for estela to get married .
now i have to concentrate on ana .
they're delicious .
that's how i like them .
you're a treasure .
grandpa ...
do you remember our gold ... close to our hometown , near the hills?
there was a cave full of gold .
papa , those are only legends .
and the men who saw the cave and the gold?
the gold doesn't exist , dad .
grandpa , tell me about the treasure .
many years ago , during the revolution ... people would hide their gold in the caves in the mountains .
after the revolution , there was a rumor ... that there was a cave full of gold ... close to our hometown .
this gold can only be taken by a man with a pure heart .
i always wanted to find that gold .
grandpa , i'm sure you're going to find it .
look , i already found it .
you are my gold .
now i want you to find yours .
jimmy .
what's up?
ana , how's it going?
mr. guzman , i did it .
i filled out the applications .
look at that , ana , way to go .
is it the truth?
of course it is .
i don't lie on applications .
except about my weight .
where's the personal statement?
i didn't think it was necessary .
you didn't write one?
you have to write one .
i'm friendly with the dean of admissions at columbia .
if you write it now i can get it to him and get you in for the september semester .
really?
but look , you need to write an essay .
about what?
write about something you know .
you can write about yourself .
myself?
why not?
you can do this .
i'll keep this until you bring me the essay .
go , write .
bye .
when are you going to europe?
hey , jimmy .
i don't know if i'm going anymore .
my sister needs me to stay and help her with her fashion boutique .
i was thinking about joining you , but you're not going anymore?
no .
europe is so cool .
you'll get a whole new perspective .
what kind of perspective?
it's different in europe .
things are too easy here .
like you're handed everything from school to a car .
that's why i want to teach , do something different , you know?
i'm doing some assistant work for mr. guzman this summer .
what are you doing?
i have to go , so i'll see you later .
your number?
maybe we could hang out .
yeah , i gotta go .
bye .
it's finished .
with that music , they want to get on tv .
they need to improve a little bit .
yeah , i'd say .
carmencita , your back hurting again?
after 38 years of sewing , what else do you expect?
estela , ana , you really missed something in the soap opera the poor cry more .
mom , i don't watch spanish soap operas .
it's not a regular novela , it's a brazilian .
they're better .
isn't that so?
much better .
what happened?
you remember juanita , the cross eyed daughter?
yes , i remember .
well ...
this handsome , dark stranger ... comes to visit the fishing village .
and she meets him ... and he told her that he didn't care what she looked like ... that he loves her , that he wants her ... but of course we know what he wanted , no?
one night , without telling her parents , juanita goes out with the stranger .
mom , let me guess , she gets pregnant?
ana , don't spoil the story .
what happened?
she gets pregnant .
and worse , he asks her to run away with him .
of course that means that she has to betray her mother's wishes .
and then?
entonces , they're on the bus to rio ... and she sticks out her head to say goodbye ... to her mother who was crying there .
and all of a sudden this bus comes by ...
and it cut her head off !
mom , that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard .
ana , you better listen .
that's what happens to people who don't listen to their mother .
okay .
and all you had was the headless body .
hello?
hi , jimmy , it's ana .
hey , ana !
are you busy?
is this a bad time?
i can call you back later .
i mean , i'm just calling to say hi .
no , it's a good time , actually .
listen to this insane computer program i found on the web .
mierda . " " shit .
it's curse words in spanish .
really?
ya la cague . " " i screwed up .
where did you get this?
pendejo . " " jerk . " " pinche . " " goddamn it .
all right , okay , jimmy , i get it .
hello?
do you think i'm your maid?
you left dishes in the sink .
get water , the burner's here .
shut up , she's coming .
we almost finished pinning the pattern .
look .
what do you think?
okay .
just a few little adjustments here and then we can get started .
aren't we supposed to be working?
we're already behind schedule .
why isn't everyone here?
norma , why are you late?
where's your mother and your sisters?
estela , i need to talk to you .
okay .
estela , i'm sorry .
i say this from the heart .
why are you sorry?
i wanted to tell you earlier , but i didn't know how to tell you .
tell me .
what?
i'm getting married sooner than i thought .
when's the wedding?
next month .
i'm so happy for you .
in mexico .
i have to leave tomorrow .
my fiance wants me to move with him to mexico .
norma , you're my fastest employee .
i need you .
i know .
i'm so proud of the work that i've done for you .
i'm sorry that i have to leave .
and you're my best boss .
my mother and my sisters are moving with us .
you're all leaving me?
no , norma , por favor !
it's always been my mother's dream to go back to her village in mexico .
i'm sorry .
perdoname .
don't be sorry , i'm happy for you .
i just can't pay you right now , okay?
i'm sorry .
give my check to my cousin at the chapala market .
okay , gracias .
good luck .
mrs. carmen ... thank you for everything .
god bless you .
we need those four seamstresses to finish this work .
i mean , we never finish on time .
you know the glitz company .
they don't pay me until we do .
i have no money to pay any of you .
i should just close the factory .
no , you can't close the factory .
i can't believe you're paying us late again .
i just lost four seamstresses .
how are we gonna finish this order?
i can wait a little bit , but not too long .
gracias , rosali .
and you , pancha?
i'll charge you interest .
are you serious?
no .
but let's get back to work before i change my mind .
and you , mrs. carmen?
what kind of a mother would i be if i didn't help my daughter?
and you say i don't love you .
it's because i love you that i make your life so miserable .
don't love me so much .
and you , girl?
estela , if you don't pay me , how am i gonna save up any money?
for what?
forget it .
ana , you're so selfish .
you expect me to do this dirty work for nothing?
this is dirty work?
this is a sweatshop .
don't you get it?
you're all cheap labor for bloomingdale's !
we are not cheap labor .
how would you know what hard work is?
all you've done is flip burgers !
i'm grateful for what ama has taught me .
and i'm proud of what i do !
you little brat !
i never wanted to work here in the first place !
much less for nothing .
see the trouble you cause?
estela?
come on , i'm sorry , okay?
i'll help you .
can you work until i can pay you?
yeah .
thanks .
let's get back to work .
you burned yourself , dear !
heal , heal , little frog tail .
if it doesn't heal now , it will heal tomorrow .
fatty , wake up .
what time is it?
it's still night .
then why are you waking me up?
i have a secret .
i'm telling it only to you .
mom , i'm sleeping .
you're not gonna believe this , but i'm pregnant .
what?
i'm pregnant .
how could you be pregnant?
a woman knows these things .
but don't tell anybody .
mom , you're imagining things .
ana , i need you more than ever now .
it's probably just gas .
eat less beans .
why did norma and the others have to leave?
that doesn't look that bad .
ladies ...
you are not going to believe this .
i heard gossip at the chapala market .
no food in the work place .
it's our break time .
then you take a break , because i can't afford one .
come .
our normita ... ate the cake before the wedding .
i heard that norma's fiance convinced her to have sex ... with him the night before , and after he had a taste ...
100 people at the church , the priest waiting ... and he never showed up for the ceremony .
god damn him .
norma's mother never approved of the man ... pero norma insisted .
no , no .
a mother knows the right man for her daughter .
mom , you're so old fashioned .
can you believe her?
girls nowadays think they know so much .
that's why they end up panzonas .
no , the reason they end up pregnant ... is 'cause they don't know how to use contraceptives .
look at her , miss know it all .
your husband won't like you knowing so much .
why?
a man wants a virgin .
why is a woman's virginity the only thing that matters?
a woman has thoughts , ideas , a mind of her own .
a mind , and thoughts?
no more stories , ama !
estela , that's what i do best !
my reason for living .
sorry .
what are you writing?
i'm writing a letter to mrs. glass .
who's that?
she's the owner of the manufacturing company .
she's the one who pays us to make these dresses .
yeah , i'm asking for an advance on the dress order .
i need to pay the electricity and the monthly bills .
i'm late on the rent .
estela , that's serious .
i know .
if you really need this money , you should go and talk to her in person .
a letter's not gonna do anything .
she's too busy , she won't see me .
i'll go with you .
she's too busy .
you're not afraid of her , are you?
why should i be afraid of her?
ana , please don't say anything , okay?
i can try .
hi , is mrs. glass here?
who are you?
i'm a contractor for mrs. glass , my name is estela garcia .
do you have an appointment?
no .
you need an appointment .
okay , we don't have an appointment , let's go .
hello , mrs. glass .
estela .
hi .
what can i do for you?
i know that last month we were a couple of days late ... but ... we were hoping that ... that you ...
we need an advance .
money ... to pay the bills , the electricity so that we can work ... and get you your dresses on time when you need them .
and who are you?
i'm estela's business partner , ana .
ana , estela knows the rules .
i can't pay advances .
i went out on a limb to hire you in the first place ... because i believe a woman like me should help one like you ... but i can only help you so much .
you have to help yourself and meet your deadlines .
you have until the end of the month , when the order has to be shipped .
you have 10 days , honey .
10 days , that's it .
i'll be back at 3 : 00 .
she's worse than you said .
did you say something , estela?
no .
because it sounded like you did .
i didn't say anything .
i see .
you ladies have a nice day .
can't you keep your mouth shut?
i was just trying to help .
i'm trying to keep the factory open for all of us .
you know , people depend on me .
your mother is waiting for you , dear .
your mother is a little crazy .
you're just figuring this out?
she's asking for her little girl .
who knows what she might want?
hi .
hi .
what?
shut the door .
i have morning sickness .
mom , it's not morning , it's evening .
ana , be serious .
comfort me .
did you ever think that maybe you're not pregnant ... and you're just imagining all of this?
i am pregnant .
a woman knows .
i haven't had my period for three months .
then why don't you go talk to the doctor , not me .
are you ready to leave?
i'm coming , grandpa !
let's go .
and where are you two going?
ana invited me to the movies tonight .
i think it's a great idea .
bye , dad .
don't wait up for us .
have fun .
thank you , good night .
okay .
we'll meet here in two hours .
be good .
hi .
this is a great place .
yeah .
are you staring at my boobs?
no .
yes , no .
okay .
i mean , they're so big , why wouldn't you , right?
i'm a guy , i guess i kind of have to .
can we change the subject?
yes , hi .
hi .
i made this list of topics to talk about ... so that we wouldn't run out of things to talk about .
okay .
can i see the list?
you have a really beautiful face .
just my face?
i'm sorry .
you don't take compliments well?
no .
compliments , that's not one of the topics on my list .
and you don't want to show me the list?
no .
no .
are big breasts on the list?
hi .
let's order .
i had a nice night tonight .
me , too .
that's where i have to meet my grandpa .
i guess this is good night .
okay , bye .
bye .
it's that time again , panchita?
yes .
today's the anniversary of my father's death .
he was so handsome .
yes .
he was a very elegant man .
the day he died ...
i couldn't pay the hospital ... so i pretended ... that he was still alive ... and i put him in a wheelchair ... and i took him home in a taxi .
you were a good daughter , panchita .
i tried .
hi , estela .
hi , mr. hiro .
the rent is three weeks late .
i'm so sorry .
will you be able to pay rent by the end of the month?
yes , of course .
good .
i like having you as a tenant and i'd hate to have to kick you out .
no .
say hi to rosali for me .
i will .
bye .
papa !
anita .
what are you doing here?
papi , i need some help .
i told estela this many times .
if you do not have the cash up front ...
do not do it .
yes , i know , but she's working hard ... and it's just not working out .
she still has to pay the rent .
i know , papa , but it's not her fault .
i mean , i never realized how hard she works .
okay .
i will lend estela the money .
thank you , papa .
estela , let me see .
it's beautiful .
did you draw it yourself?
yes .
you're lying .
you probably copied it from a magazine .
no , i did it .
i'm working on my own line .
would you buy a dress like this?
of course i would buy a dress like this .
if it would fit me .
this gray dress is the biggest order i've ever had .
it won't be easy .
if we don't finish it by the end of the month the manufacturer won't pay us .
let's prove to them that we can do it .
let's make 150 gray dresses of better quality than anyone else .
estela , maybe we can turn on the fan in here .
the fan blows dust on the dresses .
can you iron a little faster?
i need help with the hems , we won't make the deadline .
estela , it's not that i don't iron fast enough .
every time i finish ironing , i stop for a minute ... to really look at the dress .
i never realized how much work , " puro lomo , " as mom says ... is put into it .
and then i wake up , and i remind myself that it's not for me .
so i put that plastic bag over it .
and stick it on the rack ... push it away .
she got a point .
come on , hurry up .
straighten up , walk like a lady .
even i , in my condition , i walk like a lady .
hi .
hi .
is ana there?
who is this?
this is cecilia .
yes .
i will call her for you .
do you want to hear music tonight?
no thank you .
let's go , guys .
good evening .
hi .
ready to go?
what's wrong?
jimmy , does your mom understand you?
most of the time .
does your mom?
no .
i don't know , it's like she hates me .
she thinks i'm fat and i'm ugly and god knows what ...
you're not fat .
you're beautiful .
where did you tell your mom you were tonight?
she thinks i'm at mass again .
so , is this a sin?
no , that's a beso .
a kiss .
can't believe i'm leaving in two weeks to go to teacher's college .
ana , don't worry .
you're gonna get accepted to college , too .
are we done?
you have one more dress to iron .
estela , this is beautiful .
did you make this?
what's it for?
it's for you .

i cut this especially for your body , okay?
pretty dresses aren't just for skinny girls .
this one's yours .
i spent a lot of money on this material .
shut up !

thank you , darling .
whose turn is it?
mine .
here's my piece .
what do you want?
senora , can i please speak to your daughter?

the dean called me personally with the news .
my god , are you serious?
your daughter's been accepted for admission ... to columbia university with a full scholarship .
please , come in , sit down .
i got accepted with a scholarship?
so , where is this columbia university?
it's in new york city .
new york?
what's wrong with that?
look , mr. guzman , it isn't that we don't want ana to go to college ... but all the way to new york?
i'm sure there must be wonderful colleges in this area .
but none of them is columbia university .
papa , you don't understand , it's one of the best schools in the nation .
sir , you left your country for a better opportunity ... and now , it's ana's turn .
look , mr. guzman ...
raul !
senor guzman ... we are a family , and we intend to stay that way .
mama , it's not gonna change anything .
please .
it's okay , carmencita .
mr. guzman , ana is going to go to college .
but not now .
i didn't come this far to see my family break apart .
papa , i don't understand .
how is this breaking us apart?
what about estela and the factory?
what about it?
what about abuelo?
you want to abandon him?
no .
thank you very much , senor guzman ... but this is a family matter .
thank you very much for coming all the way here to tell us .
don't put chilies on the nopalitos .
i'll get an upset stomach .
then don't eat them .
listen ...
have you heard that if you take the baby away from saint antonio he'll work faster?
si .
didn't you know that?

jimmy , really .
don't worry about me anymore , okay?
i mean , once you get to college ... we won't have anything to talk about , anyway ... and i don't know , you'll probably end up meeting some skinny girl , right?
i'm really gonna miss you .
you tramp .
what?
you lost your virginity , didn't you?
mom , you're imagining things .
i can tell !
you're not only fat , now you're a puta !
you would say that , wouldn't you?
why didn't you value yourself?
because there's more to me than what's in between my legs !
you better not get pregnant and embarrass me .
me , embarrass you?
come on .
you're the one pretending to be pregnant for attention .
i am pregnant .
you're not !
yes , i am !
you're not pregnant , mom !
you're only pretending because you want a baby in the house .
but you can't have a baby .
i'm not your baby anymore !
no , senora , you're not pregnant .
of course i am .
dona carmen , don't you think i know a thing or two about this?
i haven't had a period in four months .
dona carmen , that's not unusual for a woman your age .
i think it's about time you and i ... had a little conversation about menopause .
that means " the change of life .
mom , the doctor said no sugar .
why are you eating a flan?
i'm having a craving .
but you're not pregnant .
okay , i'm not pregnant .
i'm going through the change of life .
it's over .
i'm no longer a woman .
a grandmother is what i should be at this age .
you know , ana ... you're not bad looking .
lf you lost weight ...
just stop it !
you could be beautiful !
stop it !
you're overweight , too !
so why should i listen to you?
ana , don't eat the flan .
this is beautiful .
i stink .
damn !
who farted?
he who smells it first is the one who has it beneath him .
ana , please don't waste the distilled water , it's expensive .
estela , it's so hot in here .
seriously , i feel like i'm in hell .
fifteen , sixteen ...
how many more dresses to finish?
eighteen .
only 18?
such a relief we're almost done with this .
ana !
what are you doing?
mama , come on .
it's so hot , all the steam has me sweating like a pig .
we're sweating , too , but we're not taking our clothes off .
why not?
we're all women , we all have the same things .
put it on .
estela , rosali , pancha , please .
aren't you hot in those clothes?
i feel so sticky .
aren't you embarrassed?
of what?
look at you , you look awful .
mama , i happen to like myself .
right on , sister !
and you?
the two of you should lose weight .
you would look beautiful without all that fat !
dona carmen , ana and estela are beautiful .
they look good the way they are !
thank you , pancha .
thank you , pancha .
aren't you ashamed?
mama , you look just like us .
yes , but i'm married .
so that's it .
make myself attractive so that i can catch a man .
ana , listen to her .
learn now or you'll end up like estela .
mama , i do want to lose weight .
and part of me doesn't because my weight says to everybody , fuck you !
hail mary !
what are you trying to do?
how dare anybody tell me what i should look like ... or what i should be ... when there's so much more to me than just my weight !
what's wrong with wanting to be thin and sexy?
you don't get it .
i want to be taken seriously .
respected for what i think , not for how i look .
exactly , thank you .
what if you don't think anything?
i look like a cow .
rosali , shut up !
stand up , you know , look at yourself .
if you're a cow , then i'm a hippo .
and i'm an elephant .
and i'm orca .
you are so skinny in comparison to all of us .
no , i'm not , look at my fat hips .
come on .
and my cellulite .
