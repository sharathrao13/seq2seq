<i>random thoughts</ i> <i>for valentine's day , 2004 . </ i>
<i>today is a holiday invented</ i> <i>by greeting card companies ... </ i>
<i>last call ... </ i> <i>to make people</ i> <i>feel like crap . </ i>
<i>i ditched work today . </ i>
<i>took a train out to montauk . </ i>
<i>montauk train boarding</ i> <i>on track " b. " </ i>
<i>i don't know why . </ i>

<i>sand is overrated . </ i>
<i>it's just tiny little rocks . </ i>
<i>if only i could</ i> <i>meet someone new . </ i>
<i>i guess my chances of that happening</ i> <i>are somewhat diminished, </ i> <i>seeing that i'm incapable</ i> <i>of making eye contact</ i> <i>with a woman i don't know . </ i>
<i>maybe i should</ i> <i>get back together with naomi . </ i>
<i>she was nice . </ i>
<i>nice is good . </ i>
<i>she loved me . </ i>
<i>why do i fall in love</ i> <i>with every woman i see ... </ i> <i>who shows me</ i> <i>the least bit of attention? </ i>

yeah .
anyway , this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names .

you think there could possibly be a job like that?
i mean , how many hair colors could there be?
fifty , maybe .
someone's got that job .
agent orange !
i came up with that one .

i think about that .

i apologize .
this is a hoax , right?
i mean , this is clem ...
i assure you , no . <i></ i> <i>no . </ i>
mm mmm .
there's no such thing as this .
look , our files are confidential , mr. barish , so i can't show you evidence .
suffice it to say that miss , uh ...
miss kruczynski was not happy , and she wanted to move on .
<i>we provide that possibility . </ i>
miss kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on . <i></ i>
we provide that possibility .
what the hell is that?
nicest guy she ever went out with .
<i>oww !
fuck ! </ i>
god , rob !
give it a rest !
it's okay .
it's all right .
carrie , i am making a birdhouse .
<i>what can i say , joel? </ i>
<i>you know clementine .
she's like that . </ i>
she's impulsive .
she decided to erase you almost as a lark .
a lark .
why?
why?
why?
why did you do that?
<i>wait , wait , wait , wait ! </ i>
i'm sorry , doctor .
he just barged right in here .
okay .
i want it done .
i told him pre valentine's day is our busy time .
oh , th th that's ... that's okay , mary .
but there are people waiting .
mr. barish , if you'd like to , uh ... to come inside .
and , mary , if you could take care of mrs. woo .
good bye , mrs. woo .
<i>yes , of course . </ i>
now , the , uh ... the first thing we need you to do , mr. barish , <i>is to go home ... </ i> <i>and collect everything you own</ i> <i>that has some association with clementine . </ i>
<i>anything . </ i>
<i>and we'll use these items to create</ i> <i>a map of clementine in your brain . </ i>
<i>okay? </ i>
<i>so we'll need , uh, </ i> <i>uh , photos , clothing , gifts, </ i> <i>books she may have bought you, </ i> <i>cds you may have bought together, </ i> <i>journal entries . </ i>
<i>we want to empty your home ... </ i>
<i>we want to empty your</ i> life <i>of clementine . </ i>
<i>and after the mapping is done, </ i> <i>our technicians will do the erasing</ i> <i>in your home tonight . </ i>
<i>that way , when you awake</ i> <i>in the morning, </ i> <i>you'll fixind yourself in your own bed</ i> <i>as if nothing had happened ... </ i> <i>a new life awaiting you . </ i>
wake up , buddy !
<i>no , i'm sorry , mrs. sobel . </ i>
<i>you can't have the procedure done</ i> <i>three times in one month . </ i>
well , it's just not our policy ...
how are you today , mr. barish?
<i>hello .
i'm right here . </ i>
i know it's an emergency , and we'll do everything we can ...
we can fit you in on the first of march .
<i>maybe you could talk to the doctor, </ i> <i>a and he ... </ i>
<i>all right , so let's make an appointment . </ i>
<i>what day would you like</ i> <i>to come in this week? </ i>
mr. barish .
um , he's really busy this afternoon .
<i>maybe tomorrow would be better . </ i>
<i>around 12 : 15?
can you do that? </ i>
february is very busy for us because of valentine's day .
this is , uh , stan fink , <i>one of our most experienced</ i> <i>and skilled technicians . </ i>
he'll be handling your case tonight .
great to meet you , mr. barish .
my name is joel barish , and i'm here to erase clementine kruczynski .
very good .
now , tell me about , uh , clementine .
uh , i was ...
living with this woman , naomi , uh , a couple years ago , and my friends rob and carrie invited us to this party at the beach ...
i don't like parties .
<i>naomi couldn't go , but i went ... </ i> <i>and i , uh , met clementine . </ i>
i'm sorry .
let's start with your most recent memories ... and work backwards from there , more or less .
there's an emotional core ... to each of our memories , and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process .
by the time you wake up in the morning , all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared , as in a dream upon waking .
is there any risk of brain damage?
well , uh , technically speaking , the procedure <i>is</ i> brain damage , but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking .
nothing you'll miss .
comfortable?
what we're doing here , mr. barish , is actually creating a map of your brain .
<i>okay , let's get started . </ i>
<i>if we want to get</ i> <i>this procedure underway tonight, </ i> <i>we have some work to do . </ i>
i want you to react to these objects , mr. barish , if you will .
there's a good story behind this one ...
uh , actually , mr. barish , i'll get a much better emotional readout ... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items .
just try to focus on the memories .
oh .
sorry .
okay .
<i>healthy activity up there again . </ i>
<i>healthy readouts .
very good . </ i>
here's another object . <i> </ i> <i>that's so ... </ i>
next item .
okay .
potato head .
next item .
okay . <i> </ i>
<i>just focus on the memories . </ i>
<i>patrick , do me a favor . </ i>
<i> hey , patrick, </ i> <i>do me a favor , will ya? </ i>
<i> yeah . </ i>
<i>can you check the voltage regulator? </ i>
<i>what do we got there? </ i>
uh , voltage looks fine .
really?
well , i'm not wiping as clean as i like here .
i'm ...
<i>well , uh , technically the procedure</ i> is <i>brain damage . </ i>
check the , uh ...
check the connections , please .
oh , there you are .
i ...
why am i ...
i don't understand what i'm looking at .
why am i standing here and ...
oh , my god .
dj vu .
dj vu .
this is so ...
all right , we should get started .
if we're gonna get the procedure ...
underway tonight , we have some work to do .
i'm in my head already , aren't i?
i suppose so .
uh , this is about right .
this is what it ...
this is what it would look like .
very good .
we'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here .
that way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home .
ah , there we go .
patrick?
<i>yeah? </ i>
<i>patrick , can you check ... </ i>
patrick?
<i>i'm getting some sort of readout</ i> <i>of my own voice . </ i>
patrick?
patrick?
why are there so many wires?
<i> a lot of equipment . </ i>
does that help?
<i> are you sure</ i> <i>you set that thing up properly? </ i>
<i> how's that? </ i>
<i> how are you today, </ i> <i>mr .
barish? </ i>
there we are , mr. barish .
<i> that's better . </ i>
i don't know if i like this .
think i might try this , then .
we're almost done now .
<i>mmm .
journal . </ i>
<i>that would be invaluable . </ i>
<i>" i met someone tonight . </ i>
<i>i don't know what to do . </ i>
<i>her name is clementine, </ i> <i>and she's amazing . " </ i>
whoa !
jesus !
what?
what?
come on !
careful !
step back !
<i>just take it easy . </ i>
that's fine .
let's not roach the guy .
all right , you got that one .
this place is sort of a dump , don't you think?
<i>it's an apartment , patrick . </ i>
patrick .
<i>well , not a dump , then, </ i> <i>but sorta plain .
uninspired . </ i>
<i>and there's sort of</ i> <i>a stale smell . </ i>
<i>patrick , can we just please</ i> <i>get through this? </ i>
we got a very long night ahead of us .
come on .
<i>yeah .
yeah . </ i>
<i>this is the last time i saw you . </ i>
it's 3 : 00 .
<i>i kinda sorta wrecked your car . </ i>
<i>were you driving drunk? </ i>
<i>it's pathetic . </ i>
<i>i was a little tipsy . </ i>
<i>don't call me pathetic . </ i>
well , it is pathetic .
it's fucking irresponsible .
could've killed somebody .
<i> oh , god . </ i>
maybe you <i>did</ i> kill somebody .
should we turn on the news and see?
<i>oh , christ ! </ i>
<i>should i check the grill to see</ i> <i>if there's any children or small animals? </ i>
i didn't kill anybody !
it's just a fucking dent , joel .
you're like an old lady or something .
well , what are <i>you</ i> like?
a wino?
<i>a wino? </ i>
jesus , are you from the '50s or something?
a <i>wino? </ i>
face it , joely .
you're freaked out because i was out late without you , and in your little wormy brain ... you're trying to figure out , did she fuck someone tonight?
no , see , clem ,
i assume you fucked someone tonight .
isn't that how you get people to like you?
<i>i'm sorry .
okay? </ i>
clem , i didn't mean it .
all right?
clem?
<i>your keys . </ i>
i was just ...
i was just ...
i won't need them anymore .
angry or annoyed or something , i don't know .
clem?

mary's coming over tonight .
<i>yeah? </ i>
yeah .
<i>just thought you'd wanna know . </ i>
<i>i like mary .
i like when she comes to visit . </ i>
<i>i just don't think she likes me . </ i>
she likes you okay .
maybe i should invite my girlfriend over .
i have a girlfriend now .
do whatever you want .
did i tell you i have ...
yeah .
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend?
we gotta focus here , patrick .
yeah , the thing is , our situation is ... is a little weird .

<i>look at it out here ! </ i>
<i>it's all falling apart ! </ i>
i'm erasing you , and i'm happy !
you did it to me first !
i can't <i>believe</ i> you did this to me .
goddamn it .
clem !
can you hear me?
by morning you'll be gone !
the perfect ending to this piece of shit story !
<i> is there something wrong</ i> <i>with a girl being attracted to me? </ i>
<i>is that a problem? </ i>
<i>no , i think it's ... funny . </ i>
<i>so , who do you think's better looking, </ i> <i>me or this guy? </ i>
<i>patrick , let's focus , buddy . </ i>
<i>remember that girl</ i> <i>we did last week? </ i>
<i>the one with the ... potatoes? </ i>

i like watching you work , howard .
i guess , uh ...
i guess i'll go out for ... for some air , if nobody minds .
it looks like you have everything under control here .
yeah , that's , uh ... <i>that's fixine . </ i>
<i>do you like quotes , howard? </ i>
what do you mean?
<i>oh , you know, </ i> <i>like famous quotes? </ i>
i find reading them inspirational , and in my reading , i've come across some i thought you might like too .
oh , well , i ...
i'd love to hear some .
<i>there's one that goes, </ i>
blessed are the forgetful , for they get the better even of their blunders .
<i>that's nietzsche , right? </ i>
yeah .
and here i thought i could tell you something you didn't know .
oh , no .
it's ...
it's a good quote .
i'm happy we both know it .
yeah .
oh , and there's this other one i like .
it's by pope alexander , and it goes ...
<i>alexander pope? </ i>
oh , yeah .
<i>yeah , shit . </ i>
<i>it's just that i told myself</ i> <i>not to say " pope alexander" </ i> <i>and sound like a dope, </ i> and then i go ahead and say it .
it's no big deal .
you're such a sweetheart .
<i>the quote goes , " how happy is</ i> <i>the blameless vestal's lot? </ i>
<i>" the world forgetting, </ i> <i>by the world forgot . </ i>
<i>" eternal sunshine</ i> <i>of the spotless mind . </ i>
<i>each prayer accepted</ i> <i>and each wish resigned . " </ i>
<i>i want to be</ i> <i>a great big , huge elephant ... </ i> <i>with a huge trunk like that . </ i>
clem?
clementine?
i haven't heard that one .
it's lovely .
i just thought it would be appropriate , maybe .
i really admire the work you do , howard .
i don't mean to be so familiar .
oh , it's fine .
it's fine .
i i i i i ...
i'm happy to hear ...
i'm sorry .
i've loved you for a very long time .

you know , i have a wife and kids .
you know i have a wife and kids .

hollis , it didn't start out to be like this .
i came here to work .
hollis , this is a one time mistake !
<i>i'm a stupid girl</ i> <i>with a stupid crush ! </ i>
yeah .
i swear i basically forced him into it !
don't be a monster , howard .

oh , uh ,
we have a history .
i'm sorry .
y you wanted the procedure .

you wanted it done ... so you could get past , uh ...
you could ...
yeah .
um , i have to , uh , finish the work in there .
it's almost morning .
we'll talk later .
okay?
<i>hey . </ i>
let me give you a lift home .
fuck this thing .
damn it .
hi .
hi .
didn't figure you'd show your face around me again .
i guess i thought you were ... humiliated .
you did run away , after all .
<i>i just needed to see ya . </ i>
yeah?
i'd like to , um , take you out or something .
you're married .
not yet .
not married .
no , i'm not married , no .
look , man , i'm telling you right off the bat i'm high maintenance , so i'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage ... or whatever it is you've got going there .
if you wanna be with me , you're with me .
okay .
too many guys think i'm a concept , or i complete them , or i'm gonna make them alive .
but i'm just a fucked up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind .
don't assign me yours .
i remember that speech really well .
i had you pegged , didn't i?
you had the whole human race pegged .
hmm .
probably .
i still thought you were gonna save my life , even after that .
mmm .
i know .
it would be different ... if we could just give it another go around .
remember me .
try your best .
maybe we can .
okay , so just tell me what you remember , and , uh , then we'll take it from there .
okay .
i liked you immediately .
<i>you didn't</ i> <i>come on to me at all . </ i>
<i>i liked that . </ i>
<i>i was so tongue tied</ i> <i>around you at fixirst . </ i>
<i>i wanted you to think</ i> <i>i was smart . </ i>
i couldn't wait to come to work .
i had these fantasies of us being married ... and having kids and ... just ...
<i>oh , howie , i can't do this . </ i>
<i>we agreed it's for the best , mary . </ i>
<i>yeah , i know . </ i>
<i>oh , god . </ i>
i'll take the bottom and you ...
uh uh uh !
no , no , no .
here .
i can take that .
so you want me to carry that?
help me with that .
can you get the cooler?
honey , the cooler is ...
that's light , huh?
oh , i can get that .
you can get it .
no , no , no , no !
don't take anything .
i can take the plane .
put the thing up .
put the gate back up .
<i>this is the day we met . </ i>
<i>you were down by the surf . </ i>
<i>i couldjust make you out</ i> <i>in the distance . </ i>
<i>i remember being drawn to you</ i> <i>even then . </ i>
<i>i thought , " wow , how odd . </ i>
<i>i'm drawn to someone's back . " </ i>
<i>you were in that orange sweatshirt</ i> <i>that i would come to know so well ... </ i> <i>and even hate , eventually . </ i>
at the time i thought , " how cool !
an orange sweatshirt .
hi there .
hi .
i saw you sitting over here ... by yourself , and i thought , " thank god .
someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either .
yeah .
i don't ever know what to say .
i'm clementine .
can i borrow a piece of your chicken?
and then you just took it ... without waiting for an answer .
it was so intimate ,
like we were already lovers .
i'm joel .
hi , joel .
so , no jokes about my name .
you mean like ...
oh , my darling , oh , my darling oh , my darling clementine
huckleberry hound , that sort of thing?

i don't know .
i felt like a scared little kid .
i was like ...
it was above my head .
i don't know .
<i>you were scared? </ i>
yeah .
thought you knew that about me .
<i>i ran back to the bonfixire, </ i> <i>trying to outrun my humiliation , i think . </ i>
<i>was it something i said? </ i>
yeah .
you said , " so go " ... with such disdain , you know?
<i>oh , i'm sorry . </ i>
it's okay .
<i>joely? </ i>

<i> i didn't crash the plane . </ i>
<i>the plane crashed . </ i>
<i>i didn't crash the plane . </ i>
<i> you were operating the plane</ i> <i>with the remote control, </ i> <i>and then it crashed . </ i>
<i>it was fucking windy . </ i>
<i>come on , man . </ i>
<i>you're stoned , and you're driving . </ i>
<i>yeah , the pot balances it out . </ i>
<i>the pot brings you back up . </ i>
<i>that's why i smoke it . </ i>
<i>if i'm going to be drinking, </ i> <i>then i'll smoke it . </ i>
<i>it does . </ i>
<i>that's a medical fact . </ i>
<i>it was proven</ i> <i>on the science network . </ i>
<i>honey , just watch the road . </ i>
<i> i can't see shit . </ i>
i saw you talking to somebody pretty .
<i>she was nice . </ i>
yeah , man .

okay .
so i gotta ...
i gotta drop the van off .
<i>thanks , stan .

of course not .
god , no .
and you never even suspected we were together?
once , maybe .
i was coming back from a job , and you were at his car .
i saw you two talking .
so i waved to you , and you giggled , you know .
how'd i look?
you looked happy .
happy with a secret .
and after that?
i never saw you two together again like that , so i just ...
i don't know .
i just figured i was imagining things .
aah !
<i> montauk train</ i> <i>now boarding on track " b. " all aboard . </ i>
i really like you , mary svevo .
you know that?
thanks .
let me get my toothbrush .

<i>where are you , clem? </ i>
<i>i'm worried . </ i>

<i>i feel like you're mad at me, </ i> <i>and i don't know what i did . </ i>
<i>what did i do? </ i>
<i>i love you so much . </ i>

whew .
<i>vmonos , seor . </ i>
i i had a really nice time last night .
nice?
i had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life ...
last night .
that's better .
this is weird .
<i> to all patients</ i> <i>of dr. howard mierzwiak . </ i>
<i>my name is mary svevo . </ i>
we've met , but you don't remember me .
i worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased .
<i>i have since decided</ i> <i>that this is a horrible ... </ i>
some kind of teaser ad or something .
<i>in order to correct this, </ i> <i>i'm sending everyone's fixile back to them . </ i>
<i>my name is clementine kruczynski . </ i>
<i>i'm here to erase joel barish . </ i>
what is this?
i don't know .
<i>he's boring . </ i>
<i>is that enough reason</ i> <i>to erase someone? </ i>
<i>i've been thinking lately</ i> <i>how i was before and how i am now, </ i> <i>and it's like he changed me . </ i>
<i>i feel like i'm always pissy now . </ i>
<i>i don't like myself when i'm with him . </ i>
<i>i don't like myself anymore . </ i>
<i>i can't stand to even look at him . </ i>
<i>that pathetic , wimpy , apologetic smile . </ i>
<i> that sort of wounded puppy shit</ i> <i>he does , you know? </ i>
what are you doing?
i'm not doing anything .
<i>the bloom is certainly</ i> <i>fucking off the rose at this point . </ i>
are you screwing with me?
no !
you are screwing with me .
joel , i'm not !
you clearly are .
look , let's just take a minute and ...
patrick , get the fuck away .
oh , sweetheart ...
get the fuck away from me !
can we talk about it?
no !
get the fuck away !
joel barish .
<i>hey , clementine . </ i>
hey .
nice to see you .
yeah .
yeah .
<i>really very educated . </ i>
<i>i mean , she's smart , i think, </ i> <i>but not educated . </ i>
<i>i couldn't really talk to her</ i> <i>about books , you know? </ i>
she's more of a magazine reading girl .
<i>her vocabulary leaves</ i> <i>something to be desired . </ i>
<i>sometimes ... </ i>
<i>i was embarrassed in public ... </ i>
<i>hi . </ i>
<i>because she would pronounce ... </ i>
<i>library " libary . " </ i>
<i>hi . </ i>
<i>libary .
libary . </ i>
look what i found .
<i> i think if there's</ i> <i>a truly seductive quality</ i> <i>about clementine, </ i> <i>it's that her personality promises</ i> <i>to take you out of the mundane . </ i>
<i>you made me look skinny . </ i>
<i>amazing , burning meteorite ... </ i> <i>will carry you to another world</ i> <i>where things are exciting . </ i>
<i>but what you quickly learn</ i> <i>is that ... </ i> <i>it's really an elaborate ruse . </ i>
i'm sorry i yelled at you .
it's okay .
<i>so flashy</ i> <i>in a kind of obvious way . </ i>
<i>but still , it seduces you . </ i>
joel , i really like you .
i hate that i said mean things about you .
let me turn this off , okay?
<i> hey , it's ... it's only fair . </ i>
<i>where's the real clementine? </ i>
<i>i mean , the whole thing with the hair ... </ i> <i>it's all bullshit . </ i>
i really like your hair .
thank you .
<i>i really like your hair . </ i>
thank you .
i do .
<i>the world's a goddamn mess . </ i>
<i>is it some kind of a revolt? </ i>
<i>change your hair color . </ i>
you want a drink or something?
do you have any whiskey?
<i>no , i don't think her sex</ i> <i>is ... motivated . </ i>
<i>i saw it clearly</ i> <i>the last night we were together . </ i>
<i>it wasn't sex . </ i>
<i>it was just sad . </ i>
hey .
sorry .
i thought there was more .
<i>the only way clem thinks</ i> <i>she can get people to like her ... </ i> <i>is to fuck 'em ... </ i> <i>or at least dangle the possibility</ i> <i>of getting fucked in front of'em . </ i>
<i>and she's so desperate</ i> <i>and insecure ... </ i> <i>that she'll , sooner or later, </ i> <i>go around fucking everybody . </ i>
i don't do that .
<i>i wouldn't think that</ i> <i>about you . </ i>
because i don't .
i know .
<i>because it really hurts me</ i> <i>that you said that</ i> <i>because i don't do that . </ i>
<i>i'm so sorry . </ i>
i'm sorry about all this .
i'm gonna ... go .
i'm a little confused .
i don't really think i can be here .
um ... bye .
bye . <i></ i> <i>i thought i knew her so well . </ i>
it was nice meeting you and all .
<i>but i don't know her at all . </ i>
<i>what a loss to spend</ i> <i>that much time with someone, </ i> <i>only to fixind out</ i> <i>that she's a stranger . </ i>
wait .
what?
<i>i don't know . </ i>
just wait .
just wait .
<i>what do you want , joel? </ i>
i don't know .
i want you to wait for ... just a while .
<i>okay . </ i>
really?
<i>i'm not a concept , joel . </ i>
<i>i'm just a fucked up girl who's looking</ i> <i>for my own peace of mind . </ i>
i'm not perfect .
i can't see anything that i don't like about you .
right now i can't .
but you will .
but you will .
you know , you will think of things , and i'll get bored with you and feel trapped ... because that's what happens with me .
