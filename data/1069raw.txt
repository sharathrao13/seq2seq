shit .
fell off the chair .
i wasn't , uh ...
i know you're wearing a skirt , but i didn't see anything .
mostly trousers these days .
yeah , i prefer skirts .
healthier , isn't it?
i imagine .
allows the air to , uh , circulate around the ...
.. vagina !
we're ready for you , mr garden .
yes , yes .
we've had a letter of complaint stating that you are a " negative and destructive influence
on the smooth running of the blackpool probation office .
i think whoever wrote that letter , it's just a clash of personalities .
it's signed by everyone in your office .
right , yeah , well , i mean , that's what i mean .
it's a clash between ... me and them .
a negative and destructive influence , " mr garden .
are they right?
well , if you think that remembering a client's first name is less important than claiming generous expenses , then , yes , they're right .
if it's best for a client who's just left prison for the 14th time to be passed on to yet another department , then , yes , they're right .
but i've seen over 1, 000 clients and i believe every single one ...
of these 1, 000 , how many are now going straight?
three .
simon garden was an inspiration .
my first day out , he gave me a blank sheet of paper and he said , " that's your future .
you can write and apply for a job or you can wipe your arse on it .
and i said , " i'm not afraid to get my hands dirty .
before i met simon , i was thievin 'and hitting people .
but now ...
i'm a fishmonger .
it's another string to me bow .
12 months ago , i was in prison .
now i'm a sub service support network supervisor providing pc , mac and mainframe infrastructure with online e task back up .
not many people can say that .
do you have anything to add regarding mr garden?
he is annoying .
it's true .
he is annoying .
we talked to your clients , mr garden .
they're good people .
i used to say ,
you're halfway up a mountain .
crime is the easy path to the bottom .
responsibility is the hard path to the top .
but when you get there , it's a great view .
" cos in every sinner ...
thank you .
there's a vacancy in manchester .
i'll take it .

we got muggers and rapists to catch .

the accountants run football these days .
see , they tell the managers who they can and cannot buy .
come to think of it , we're running everything these days .
accountants are running the world .
still , that ain't bad for business , is it?
that's why man u are winning everything .
it's down to money .
where's cochran?
polishing his shoes .
here's your girlfriend .
what about my porsche?
you're insured for fire and theft .
got something for me?
lovely .
why the bonus?
golden handshake .
market's flooded with class a.
gram of coke's 40 quid .
just not worth the risk , is it?
so we're goin 'legit .
yeah , well , just one problem with that as far as i can see .
me .
and me .
that's , uh , two problems .
we can't push our luck .
it's not luck .
i've been busy .
i've just nailed some tart to cover his arse .

let's see .
he's a copper , so he earns this much .

what the bloody hell you doin '?
boss .
still thinking of going legit?
no , just changed me mind .
you've killed him .
what?
what?
some more crisps .
who's that?
coming out .
who are you?
please don't shoot .
are those my crisps?
i'm hypoglycaemic .
th the opposite of , er , diabetes .
i overproduce insulin , my sugar levels crash ,
i get lethargic and i need regular carbohydrate snacks .
what are you doing here?
i really don't know .
oh , look , he's alive !
get him !
there he is !
uh , right , listen .
could i just say something?
if you attack me , i will go to the police .
it'll be reported .
you'll have a criminal record .
you've got one .
ok .
in my wallet , i've got ... 40 !
that's 20 each .
plus a cash card .
it's got a 200 limit , of which i've withdrawn 40 .
you've got that .
now , the pln number .
it's the battle of hastings .
oh !
oh , my god !
oh !
oh , that really hurt !
oh , oh ...
oh , bloody shit !
bloody hell !
where is he?
oh , gordon bennett !
i dunno .
no sign of him .
'good morning , manchester .
it's 8 : 00 .
'a man out walking his dog made a gruesome discovery
'when he came across a headless corpse on the stockport canal .
'police urgently seek the owner of a wallet found near the body ... '
hello , my name is simon garden .
i'd like to report a murder .
erm ...
i know i look a mess .
i , uh ...
i slept rough last night .
i got punched in the face by a man with a stick .
fell off a roof into a canal .
actually got a condom stuck on my finger .
eugh .
i'm not a lunatic .
i'm a probation officer .
um ...
i know , same thing .
but , no , this is murder and i'd like to speak to a senior officer , please .
certainly , sir .
good .
oh .
hello , simon .
hello .
i reckon we should , you know , rub him out .
we can't rub people out .
we're police officers .
aye , of course .
what about the accountant?
that was unfortunate .
are you just gonna let him go?
for the time being .
he's a very scared boy .
he'll probably go back to do gooding in toy town .
if he does talk , we'll pay him a visit .
he'll find a kilo of colombia's finest and a head in his fridge .
let's look at the facts .
i'm in charge of the investigation .
your wallet's found near the body .
you're ... " helping police with their enquiries " .
you're in a lot of trouble .
but hang on .
i think i can help you .
if you keep your mouth shut , the murderer may never be found .
you can't intimidate me .
let me give it a shot .
if you open your mouth ...
i won't lay a finger on you , but you'll go to prison .
and when those nonces and perverts get hold of a clever boy like you , and i'll make sure they do , they're gonna be queuing up round the block .
you're gonna end up with an arsehole like a clown's pocket .
that was pretty good .
do you like thai food?
why?
i thought you'd like to celebrate that you're no longer a suspect .
i can't .
i'm leaving .
i'm not really up to the job here , so i thought i'd go back to my old one .
if they'll have me .
well , what about a goodbye dinner?
it's probably best if i just go .
i was going with a bunch of mates .
i thought you might join us .
that's all .
don't worry .
you won't be missed .
listen .
it's been really , really nice working with you .
good luck with your career .
you'll go from strength to strength .
ditto .

i've just given it to the boss .

who are you?
john .
john jones .
jj .
can i help you?
you're nicked .
what?
i ...
oh , my god !
emma , it's you !
so i thought you were leaving town .
uh , no , i i changed my mind .
you look absolutely gorgeous .
i'm a prostitute .
right .
why?
don't the police pay you enough?
no , i'm undercover .
very convincing .
yeah .
you fooled me .
we can't really talk here .
why?
miami vice .
do you want a coffee?
yes .
why were you staring at that bank?
um , i'm thinking of robbing it .
simon !
hello , george .
come in , come in .
anyone fallen off the roller coaster recently?
no .
i inspect it every day .
don't worry about me , simon .
i will never go back to a life of crime , and it's all down to you .
so , if you ever want a favour , all you have to do is ask .
well , i'm glad you say that .
because i would like you to help me ...
yes?
.. rob a bank .
this is a test , isn't it?
no , no .
no , this is technically not a crime .
we're not taking money .
just a videotape of a murder .
george , it was horrific .
i saw a man strangle a human being .
well , an accountant .
no , you can't tempt me .
the murderer is a police officer ...
no . .. in charge of the ...
no !
this is not role play .
i can't go to the police .
i've been framed !
i've no one else to turn to .
look , you always said crime is the easy path to the bottom .
and now you want me to rob a bank?
it's like asking a reformed drug addict to have one last hit .
what do you think about what i just said?
oh .
that makes sense .
i shouldn't have had that curry .
but i'm all right now .
sorry !
let me off !
let me off !
hang on !
but you used to say ,
you're halfway up a mountain .
crime's the easy path down .
" responsibility ...
" get there , it's a great view .
yeah .
well , don't that make you a hypocrite?
in these circumstances , no .
oh , look , simon , it's not that i don't want to help you .
it's just , erm ...
it's me mum .
she's got crippling arthritis .
she can hardly move .
you know , i've got the shop , i've got her and , you know , a couple of chairs have been kicked over in the attic .
she don't know why there's fish everywhere .
otherwise i'd be in that car with you now .
hey , rambo !
them hake in there want guttin '.
i could've fried 'em , ate 'em , and shat 'em out by now .
give it your mum .
you big girl .
i was such an idiot .
but now i'm not an idiot .
i'm a computer salesman , thanks to you .
the beauty is they sell themselves .
all i do is provide a service support network for a small fee , which keeps the customers happy , and me .
i'm very happy .
i'm very happy .
oh , that was a shite job .
i hated it .
ah !
we're all in .
manchester , here we come .
not quite .
there's one more .
victor?
who's victor?
there was a story that victor once stole the crown jewels and then put them back without anyone noticing .
how do you know if no one saw it?
i read it in news of the world .
yep , that's were i read it .
he's a master of disguise .
yep .
sometimes even i don't recognise him .
victor?
i'm victor's wife .
after he worked with you , he tried to give up his life of crime by channelling his interests into amateur dramatics .
but one night he sneaked off to do the safe at jackson's food processing plant .
two days later , a machine was playing up .
they reckon he must have fallen into the mincer .
by that stage , the orders had already gone out .
they tried to recall them , but all they got back was half a dozen pies and a couple of pasties .
and is that what's ...
yes .
what a waste .
er , of human life .
hm .
he was very fond of you he had some tools i'm sure he would've wanted you to have .
thanks .
i don't think we've got a lawnmower .
sorry .
i'm afraid he was a bit of a hoarder .
wow , a dtl .
a what?
digital transmission imager .
oh , check this out .
don't shoot .
it's a fisheye lens .
victor obviously had a sense of humour .
there's masses of it .
what's this?
a flask .
for?
tea , coffee , hot bovril .
we'll take it .
welcome to my humble abode .
there's just one rule .
do you mind popping your shoes off?
it's a new carpet and ... you know .
apart from that , make yourselves at home .
sleeping arrangements .
i have a spare bedroom ...
thank you very much .
sofa bed ...
mine .
inflatable mattress ...
bags that !
good .
food .
who's hungry?
yeah .
we got hummus , taramasalata , uh , couscous , tabouleh , stuffed olives , cheese .
where's the cheese?
in the fridge .
have you got any bread?
uh , focaccia .
is that sliced?
well , it's , uh , prt manger .
no , it's not sliced .
right .
ok , the bank .
top view .
side road here .
front door .
uh , three windows .
stairs to the left and a door at the back , which i think leads to the vault .
so , pretty basic .
but ...
what's stopping us getting into the vault to get the tape?
that's not important .
the doors are bomb proof , the windows are toughened glass ,
there's no adjoining building .
cctv outside and inside .
dual circuit alarm on the doors .
heat and motion in every room .
electronically linked , via a control centre , to the police .
and there's the vault surrounded by concrete three feet thick .
a big two tonne door .
a combination lock changed weekly and a preset time lock .
which can only be changed from the inside .
some fresh coffee?
you isolate the power supply to the system and cut it off !
it's not an integrated circuit .
you got back up systems .
if you go near the power , you'll trigger the alarm .
discreet transistor crap that's last year's old news !
blow it up , get the money and go .
shut up !
you mean the tape , not the money .
oh , yeah .
blondie , if you want to pick holes , be my guest .
but i don't hear a better idea .
it's last year's old news !
if you don't have anything to say , shut up !
tell him to stop saying " it is last year's old news " !
it is annoying .
he acts like a council official .
i am a council official !
colin , what is today's news?
a tsmlsp .
tsimps?
a target specific multi invasive subversion program .
he means a computer virus .
he's taking the piss !
you want me to hit him?
just try it , fishface .
ow !
that really hurt !
now , listen , i'm very grateful you've all agreed to help me rob a bank .
but this is not a competition .
we have to act as a team .
now , we're all very different people , and that's a good thing .
jeff here likes oasis .
colin likes ...
what do you like?
hardcore belgian trance .
great !
george likes the beach boys .
he likes them .
i'm a bit of a deep purple nut .
uh , smoke on the water?
actually the result of a jamming session in montreux .
casino was on fire , they saw the smoke ...
anyway , the point is ...
we should get on with it .
exactly .
now , colin , what is a tsmlsp?
and would telling us about it be a waste of our time?
it locates all the alarm systems at the control centre .
would that target our bank alarm?
it can't .
it attacks all of them .
that won't shut the systems down .
you're more likely to set off every bank alarm in the city .
colin , have an extra slice of toast .
i think we deserve the morning off .
emma?
hi , simon .
oh , hi .
i was told to come up here by , uh ...
my flatmate .
right .
just have a seat .
yeah , sure .
i'm in the shower .
ok .
what are you doing this afternoon?
nothing .
now , no pressure , but , uh , my uncle bernard is part owner of a ... really cool narrow boat on the rochdale canal .
and , uh , as luck would have it , today's one of his days , but , uh , he's unwell .
uh , he's got a problem with his ... body .
but , uh , it's really nice inside .
it's , uh , warm and comfortable ... and lovely .
anyway , you've ... you've got a lovely little , uh ... cat .
so , what do you think?
about what?
you know , uh , you , me ... narrow boat , canal .
unless you've got a better idea .
that is just showing off .
it's a fertility symbol .
if you touch it , it increases your sexual potency .
right .
go on .
what?
touch it .
no .
are you afraid to touch a penis?
you're talking to a guy who's going blind .
go on .
touch it .
i'm just going to the , uh ...
don't forget to wash your hands .
good afternoon .
it's not what you think .
oh !
it's wood .
hmm !
please .
please .
could you please do something about that man over there?
emma !
emma , help !
come out , please , sir .
i know you're in there .
i will be out in a minute .
man in ladies 'toilet .
assistance required .
suspected flasher .
'roger , maggie . '
i am not a flasher .
could you come out , please , sir?
you shouldn't be in the ladies '.
i've got an upset stomach .
right , where's the perv?
get out now !
dirty bastard .
hang on .
i'm nearly done .
no , that's it .
sorry .
bit of an emergency .
now , what's the problem?
you've been reported for indecent behaviour .
he had a lump in his trousers .
yes , i had several .
i shat myself .
now , where's the nearest marks and spencer's?
straight down the high street , the first on the left .
thank you very much .
it came off in my hand .
don't worry .
it's happened to me a few times .
like jean claude van damme .
where?
roller disco , oldham .
he had a big knife .
you knocked him out with one punch .
i've told you this before?
all your stories end with you knocking someone out with one punch .
got some knives and forks .
yeah .
let's use our fingers .
what the heck .
i've been thinkin '.
go on .
try going through a window , it's too visible .
but get on the roof , you're concealed .
it buys you time .
how we gonna get in?
i'm coming to that .
there's a fire door .
which only opens from the inside .
hang on !
there's like an air vent thing there , right?
i can go through there , go around , open the fire door ,
let you all in .
brilliant .
the aperture to the air conditioning unit you are referring to is 14 inches square .
brilliant but flawed .
i could get in .
go on a diet .
you won't want that , then .
never touch my food .
whoa !
jeff , colin , calm down .
it was a good idea .
it's just ...  i'd rather you didn't argue .
jeff's got a lot on his plate at the moment .
i know , but he really makes me angry , er ... cos he talks rubbish sometimes .
but if i have upset him , i'm sorry .
that's very big of you to say so , colin .
george , anything to add to that?
huh?
what?
erm ...
erm ...
no .
jeff , you're very quiet ...
kirsty !
what the hell are you doing here?
i thought i'd rob you .
what you're doing is illegal .
so is robbing a bank .
how do you know we're robbing a bank?
it's written on your notice board .
right , kirsty .
if you forget about this , i'll forget about you robbing my house .
that's not equal .
you're robbing a bank .
w what do you want?
to join your gang and rob a bank .
we're not stealin 'money .
right?
yes .
please?
you're too young .
i could drive the getaway car .
i've stolen 44 cars .
and been caught 44 times .
we don't need you , kirsty .
i'm sorry .
right .
where were we?
jeff had the wizard idea of gaining entry through an air duct and i pointed out that none of us could fit through it .
i could .
ladybird to praying mantra .
ladybird , receiving you .
i'm a mile away and i can still hear you .
ok , now try five miles away .
over .
even if we can break in , what do we do about the getaway?
i've got an idea about that .
now , on friday , stay away from the target area until rush hour .
any questions?
why is the protest on a weekday?
for maximum disruption .
bollocks !
if we had it on a sunday at 12 noon , outside the west clyde bank , there'd be a bigger turnout .
yeah , some of us have to work .
yeah !
the city's empty on a sunday !
we'll reclaim the streets .
for the kids !
friday , 5 : 00 .
it's been decided .
who decided?
the committee .
bollocks !
some democratic organisation !
yeah !
yeah !
it is .
the elected committee votes and we abide by the committee's decision .
bollocks !
gonna let him push us around?
tell him we're not sheep .
we're not sheep !
tell him to put it to a vote .
put it to a vote !
a good idea !
all right .
all those who want the protest
on sunday at noon ...
outside the west clyde bank . .. outside the west clyde bank , raise their hands .
yes !
hurry up !
oh , god .
it's not a bloody marathon !
if they realise they've loaded a virus , won't they tell everyone?
would you tell anyone if you'd been looking at this?
yeah , but it's boring , isn't it?
just variations on a ...
i've not seen that before .
any , uh , movement on the murder investigation?
you mean the headless accountant?
no , bit of a dead end , that .
that probation officer?
he's well out of the picture .
let's not talk shop , eh?
i'd better be off .
one for the road .
no , thanks .
it's an order .
vodka chaser .
let's get it on " )
so , how's your love life at the moment?
no time for anything , really .
tsk !
know what you mean .
oh !
trying to get me drunk , inspector?
yep .
i don't believe in in house romance .
who said anything about romance?
stick to what you're best at .
what is it?
it's a gotler .
a what?
a george operated time lock equalising robot .
this is telescopic?
similar .
it's hydraulic .
and once inside the vault , this emits an electromagnetic pulse at the led displays , causing the clocks to synchronise at zero , deactivating the time lock .
how'd you know that?
i heard you phone your mother .
yeah , yeah .
she likes to know what i'm up to .
now , with the time lock , it's a simple matter for the gotler ...
oh !
i told you .
it's top heavy .
it's only a small modification .
it needs a redesign .
if that goes , we all go to jail .
it won't .
how we gonna get the bank to let us put that in the vault?
and , uh , what did you say was inside it? 10, 000 in coins , notes and cheques .
hopefully .
this buys beds for the children?
and a couple of wheelchairs .
they're disabled?
challenged .
of course .
and blind .
are they?
uh , some of them .
right , uh ...
well , unfortunately , we can't allow items like this into the vault .
we might make an exception for a valuable painting or a sculpture .
excuse me .
can i shake your hand?
yes .
it's dr moroe .

why didn't she move the pig?
piss off !
language .
it's not kirsty's fault .
why are we helping a man in corduroys?
he helped you .
that was his job .
he was paid .
we need a solution , not a whinging , surfing lemonhead .
lemon knobhead .
yeah !
no .
we don't need a curly headed wanker trying to be captain kirk .
at least he got things done .
imagine you looking for spock in star trek iv .
i'm sorry .
we couldn't find him .

that was star trek ill .
it was called the search for spock .

i know you , you're , um ...
his daughter .
hi .
hi .
uh , can i , um ...
excuse me .
they're not your family , are they?
no .
she's the joyrider .
yes .
they're ex clients .
why are they in your living room?
well , they are ... part of a voluntary self help group .
we meet regularly and what i encourage them to do is not concentrate on their own problems but look at other people's .
that's beneficial for two reasons .
one , they're less isolated , more able to focus , and two , i really like your knees .
and your eyes .
i mean , i like everything .
um ...
but i i really like your knees .
is that what you saw in the mirror?
your knees?
no .
i mean , yes , just your knees .
i probably didn't even see those .
no , no .
no , we can't .
not here .
yeah , right .
ah !
what are you planning?
um , would you like me to tell you or would you like me to be spontaneous?
simon , what are you up to?
i can explain .
di burton murdered trevor deacon .
what are you talking about?
i saw him do it .
i was eating crisps behind boxes ...
why didn't you tell me before?
burton would have framed me .
i'd be in prison .
i'd be buggered .
daily .
and what's all this for?
i can't tell you .
you're a police officer .
i thought i was your friend .
you know trevor deacon's effects?
who checked them?
di burton did it personally .
why?
it's ok .
sir , can i ask you a question?
yeah .
the murder victim , trevor deacon .
did you know him?
no .
then why is your number in his mobile phone?
do you think i murdered him?
i didn't say that .
then who did?
to tomorrow .
to the most audacious crime of the century .
he means your haircut .
to , uh ...
to having friends .
yes ...
thank you .
to friends .
search warrant .
got a locked cupboard here , sir .
looks like some kind of hatch in the ceiling .
of course , prison food is processed , but you get used to it after about 10 years the going rate for murdering an accountant .
except i didn't murder him .
you did .
yeah , but i've got an alibi .
you haven't .
if you're gonna frame me for murder , you should have more evidence .
boss , i think you'll want to see this .
nice material with a young girl in the house .
wpc walsh , kindly escort the minor from the room .
you do know she's under 16 , don't you?
of course you do .
she was in your care .
they're lovely at that age .
you're horrible .
he's right .
i'm so horrible they're giving me a bravery award tomorrow .
funny old world , isn't it?
bad dog !
drop it !
drop it !
let go of it !
let go , you horrid dog .
let go !
better have a look in the garden .
you know , i don't think we checked the kitchen .
mr garden , would you mind opening your fridge?
what's in the pot?
boiled head .
your solicitor's been delayed .
all right .
i'll wait .
can i explain?
do you really think i was boiling a head?
you've been lying to me .
give me ten seconds .
i can prove burton killed deacon .
it was recorded by security camera .
the tape is in a bank vault .
i've got to get out to the bank to get the tape to clear my name .
that was 12 seconds .
can i get a magazine?
come on .
be quick .
# we're going shopping ... #
it's that woman there !
can i see your handbag , madam?
what's this?
i didn't buy anything .
i just paid for me petrol , that's all .
burton'll get his award in three hours .
pardon?
just saying ... burton'll get his award at town hall .
why are you telling me that?
you think the guard'll give us champagne so we can toast him?
good idea .
i could smash him over the head with it .
he's being sarcastic .
just saying ...
would've been great seeing burton's face .
it would've been great if adolf hitler had opened a vegetarian restaurant instead of forming the third reich .
but it didn't happen .
don't like vegetarians .
it's get kirsty in " !
" it's kirsty , get in !

i always find on these occasions that it helps to be quick .
i thought you were dead .
just resting .

your wife said they buried ... .. six pies and a couple of pasties .
what a waste .
well , that wasn't too difficult .
what are you doing?
i'm opening a deposit box belonging to a di burton .
we got what we came for .
no harm having a look .
where's victor?
it seems to be all clear , sarge .
we'd better check the vaults .
i'll go .
reed , you go with her .
oh , wow .
wow !
there's more in here .
it's not our money .
it's not his either .
this money is from drugs .
the government will spend it on weapons of mass destruction .
right now , you are halfway up a mountain .
crime is the easy path to the bottom .
we're robbin 'a bank !
technically , yes ...
let's just take it and if we change our minds send it back?
that's a good compromise .
it's not a compromise !
you're taking the money !
" technically , yes .
sarge , lift stopped .
sarge , can you hear me?
power cut?
no , it's victor .
oh , i've got to go back .

i'm busy .
well , next week , then .
i can't .
i'm busy .
actually , i've changed me mind .
women .
this is only the beginning !
i think we have done the job .
ok .
one of us should jump first to be sure it's ok .
the other'll make sure she doesn't panic when she jumps .
right .
oh , my god !
george , i'm perfectly happy to go first if you're a bit worried .
well , i am a bit worried .
no .
no , you'll be fine .
just step off .
let gravity do the work .

tosser !
we did it !
we've got the money .
let's go !
do what you like !
i'm taking the tape to get burton .
hello .
oh , hello .
what's on the tape?
this ... is ...
a short film about killing by the polish director krzysztof kieslowski .
a simple story of a man who kills in the heat of the moment , then it follows the legal process , culminating in the man's execution , which is just as futile as the murder .
and that's the point , really , that killing is wrong .
i've seen it .
it's shit .
mm .
yes , it is .
why is it called " tuesday "?
uh ...
get after him .
security !
they're on the way .
get the tape .
take it to mr cochran .
i'll finish off here .
oi !
eh !
you wouldn't hit a man with glasses?
come here .
hey , hey , hey , hey !
hey !
never mess with an office worker .
sorry .
thank you .
each of these officers being honoured here today represent the force for good that i want to see in the 21st century .
they're all people's policemen .
come here .
one word and you're dead .
now , where's that tape?
wait !
wow !
one punch .
here's your money .
thank you .
we're climbing that mountain .
good .
you're all under arrest .
again .
oh , thanks very much .
i was wondering how i'd get hold of that .
destroy it .
you've done the job for me .
he who laughs last , laughs longest .
you got a secret plan?
yes .
and what's that?
it's a secret .
inspector burton?
how do i look?
crooked .
have we got a secret plan?
no , we're knackered .
hello .
hello .
where are we going?
you tell me .
i'm very pleased today , not just cos i'm receiving this award , but also cos after a long time , this uniform still fits .
uh , excuse me !
sorry to interrupt , but i have got a gun pointed at this officer's head , so i'm sure you're aware the procedure is to stay calm , don't inflame the situation and listen .
ok , my name is simon garden .
i'm a probation officer .
i have been wrongly accused of murder .
i can't believe there are some people talking at the back .
shh !
shh !
please be quiet , or i will shoot her in the head .
thank you .
right .
i am not a murderer .
i know it doesn't look good , but i'm not capable of murder .
i don't even know how to fire a gun .
but ...
hey , you just pull the trigger , right?
kirsty?
we borrowed this money today from a bank .
it was in a safe deposit box in the name of detective inspector burton .
mr garden , take the gun away from the young officer's head .
it's ok .
i won't pull the trigger ... but i might .
sir , may i?
explain the money .
this is money that was to be used as bait in a sting on a drug syndicate i've infiltrated posing as a corrupt policeman .
you just wasted two years of police time , simon .
what about the tape?
# they've got the policeman
# the big , friendly policeman
# pc mcgarry , number 452 #
what tape?
thank you .
it's a long time since i've said this , but i'm arresting you on suspicion of murder .
sir , i can explain .
right , now .
i've got the gun , and as you've seen , i will kill if i have to .
while you're there , put the money in the bag , please .
there should be more than that .
ow !
if you kill me , you'll be a serial killer .
no !
you have to kill three to be a serial killer .
sorry .
that's just america .
it's two here .
pulling that trigger will achieve nothing .
you'll just look silly .
you need these .
and these .
whoo hoo !
nice one .
all right .
this is a police matter .
we'll take over from here .
thank you .
you're welcome .
i'll look after the money .
are you going to let me go?
i , uh , i lost the key .
oh , well , that's all right .
george?
no problem .
oh , no .
that's a spear & jackson spring lock .
you won't be able to get those open till the morning .
colin?
sorry .
it was just a very beautiful moment .
i'll , um ...
is that , uh ... a gun in your pocket?
no , it's my penis .
