otherwise , the whole show wont work .
all right?
griffin , back home at the oak bluffs playhouse ... ... we used to disguise him as different props .
right .
great idea , weil turn bob into a bush .
it might not be such a bad idea .
it is a terrible idea !
the network has made it very clear that the kid stays out of the picture .
and this way we dont have to explain why the beaze is followed by a bush .
still gotta explain the sucky dialogue .
hey , hey , hey .
lm sorry , bob , do you now have a problem with the script?
no , no , no , the script is awesome , sir .
lts just the dialogue .
i mean , every guy knows that archie griffins the only guy ...

by the way , i gotta give you some credit for bringing moe on as a writer .
hes really given the beaze character some dignity , you know?
i dont want to be an actor who takes a role and ends up looking like an ass .

your concern is very touching , cher , but lets live in the real world .
america isnt ready for that .
besides , bob doesnt want to act .
i just dont believe bob should be cut out .
we do .

despite its generic title , honey and the beaze should generate solid buzz .
with snappy writing that pokes fun at an all too familiar genre ...
... show deserves to find an audience .
hey !
newcomer walt tenors inspired turn as cocky but sensitive ... ... biochemist mack beasley more than compensates for a lackluster perf ... ... by cher and indifferent direction by actor turned helmer griffin dunne .
tech credits are run of the mill .
