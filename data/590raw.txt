i'm glad you're using your brain .
at least i have a brain !
you're so stupid , mouth .
oh , yeah?
yes .
shut up !
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
this isn't gold .
this is a wishing well .
look .
hey , it must be the old moss garden wishing well .
i used to believe when you threw money in , it turned into your wish .
i'll take two of your coins .
that's not fair .
wait , wait , wait , you can't do this .
why?
because these are somebody else's wishes .
they're somebody else's dreams .
yeah , but you know what?
this one , this one right here ... ... this was my dream , my wish .
and it didn't come true .
so i'm taking it back .
i'm taking them all back .
come on , one eyed willy , what does this have to do with the map?
is this another one of your tricks?
maybe we should keep him alive in case he isn't lying .
good idea , jake .
put him in with your brother .
okay , ma .
come on , kid .
you dropped something .
what's that?
holy shit .
we found it on the map .
it has to do with the buried treasure .
jake , look at the date on it .
this is an authentic doubloon .
give it to me .
i told you so .
see , you guys?
you never believed me .
i said there was gonna be buried ...
troy , how far you got with andy?
all the way , buddy?
you guys are so immature .
grow up .
come on , tell us .

i didn't make it with her yet .
and i stress " yet " .

what'd you wish for?
to make it with andy .
hey , who's down there?
hey , guys , it's troy !

andy !
is that you?
yeah , it's me .
we're stuck down here .

wishes do come true .
all right , my hearties , follow me !
don't worry .
i brought you more food .
why are you locking me in here?
you're not too tight .
yes , it is .
if you get out , i'll break your legs .
what are you doing?
if you sit too close to the tv , you'll screw up your eye .
jake , leave him alone !
come on !
let me out .

chance at what , mikey?
getting killed?
look , if we keep going , someone's really gonna get hurt .
maybe dead .
we've got to get the police .
maybe chunk got the police .
maybe chunk is dead .
don't say that .
never say that .
goonies never say " die " !
i'm not a goonie .
i want to go home .
i forgot .
but still !
don't you realize?
the next time you see the sky ... ... it'll be over another town .
the next time we take a test ... ... it'll be in some other school .
our parents , they want the best of stuff for us .
now they got to do what's right for them .
because it's their time .
