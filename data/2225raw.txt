kissing children .
hugging orphans .
what a vulgar , low , despicable , political trick .
carolina .
would you like to be a princess today?
i can't , i'm too little .
too piiccola .
oh , no .
because i declare that anyone can be a princess today .
well , why don't we get you a tiara , and you can wave , and march in the parade?
in fact , why don't you all take tiaras?
all?
give them all free tiaras?
i'll take care of it later .
thank you .
yo quiiero una verde .
i want a silver one .
you won't be able to wave with your thumb in your mouth .
i can wave with this hand .
very good .
i want the purple one .
i want a crown .
can we be in the parade?
of course , of course .
we could always use more princes in the world .
ok , so ...
to be a princess , you have to believe that you are a princess .
you've got to walk the way you think a princess would walk .
so think tall , you gotta smile , and wave , and just have fun .
so are you ready?
yes .
ah , she's letting the children join her .
how charming .
not for everyone .
drumroll , please .
give the princess a drumroll .
forward ... march !
just remember , you are a princess .
# i'll spread my wiings and i'll learn how to fly
# i'll do what iit takes 'tiil i touch the sky
# and i'll make a wiish
# take a chance , make a change
# and break away
there you go .
everybody having fun?
yeah .
# but i won't forget all the ones that i love
# i'll take a riisk
# take a chance , make a change
# and break away
this has been elsie kentworthy and former miss genovia , hildegaard huffman , at the best lndependence day parade genovia's seen in years .
thanks to princess mia's special surprise .
may the rest of your day be sunny side up .
and so , gentlemen , the children from the shelter will be housed at the winter castle in the mountains of libbet .
the use of the castle as a resort is sort of a perk for parliament members and dignitaries .
exactly .
oh .
well , i'm going to de perk it , and convert it into a children's shelter until money can be raised for one of their own .
i feel guilty having two homes while they have none .
we're going to have to do something .
where are we gonna ski?
lord crawley , how is your brother doing?
i don't speak to my brother .
oh .
well , i've hired him to be the architect on the project .
mr. crawley .
your highness .
gentlemen .
jerry .
dean .
well , i look forward to getting your notes on these plans .
but no one else's .
oh , i'll give you notes , because i'm part ...
oh , no , you won't .
i'm an architect .
i am part of this parliament .
oh , you just go skiing ...
so what if i go skiing? ... and you like to be an outdoorsman .
oh , and you're a couch potato .
outdoorsman .
you're a couch potato .
outdoorsman .
couch potato .
couch potato .
outdoorsman .
outdoorsman .
couch ...
the queen approves of the plan , and i intend to see it through .
now , gentlemen , i don't think it'll take too long to raise the money .
do you?
we're setting up the ramp in the ballroom .
ok .
hello .
hello .
my hello's insignificant .
rosencrantz , guildenstern , come with me .

# i've been working at the palace
# just to pass the time away
# can't you hear the bells a ringing?
# rise up so early in the morn
# can't you hear the bells a shouting?
# maids , go do your chores
and now , to end our little show , if we all give her a shout out ,
her majesty may sing us a song .
thank you , no .
queens rarely do karaoke .
grandma , come on .
the song you sang at my 1 8th birthday party .
remember that?
they loved it .
dear , we had music then .
mia had a cd made , so you can sing along .
clarisse , clarisse ,
clarisse , clarisse , clarisse ...
some girls are fair , some are jolly and fit .
some have a well bred air , or a well honed wit .
# each one's a jewel , with a singular shine
# a work of art with its own rare design
# dear little girl , you are terribly blessed
# but it's your heart of gold i love the best
# and that will be your crowning glory
# your whole life through
# it'll always be your crowning glory
# the most glorious part
# of you
what did you do?
well , i might have tweaked it a little bit on my computer .
but i don't know how to do this sort of thing .
asana , now .
grandma , just follow asana and sing . # some boys can walk # some guys can groove
# strike an elegant pose # wear the really hip clothes
# some seem to have no faults
# but we never like those # no , we don't
# they'll praise your eyes # your melodious laugh
# call you more lovely than others by half
# the one who's right # my gorgeous prince
# will be honest and true # he'll believe in me too
# and prize your heart of gold the way i do
# he'll know that that will be your crowning glory
# your whole life through
# your love will see that it's your crowning glory
# the most glorious part
# of you
# and you # and you
# and you
me?
go on .
# that will be your crowning glory
# darling , when they tell your story
# they'll call your heart of gold your crowning glory
# the most glorious part
# of you
gretchen , hot water .
what are you saying?
well , she's smart .
and she really cares about genovia .
maybe ...
well , maybe it wouldn't be so bad if she ran the country .
are you mad?
she believes in genovia so much that she's convinced herself to marry someone that she knows she can never love .
i can't believe that i am hearing this .
you want her to rule?
after all the effort that we have put in , to end up with nothing?
it wouldn't be nothing .
genovia would be in good hands , and she would be happy .
ah .
you've fallen in love with her .
no .
no , uncle , all that i'm asking ...
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , you listen .
what do you think will happen?
that she will leave andrew and marry you?
i put in the effort to make you a king , not to have you marry a queen .
i will not have it , sir .
don't worry , uncle .
that will never happen .
mia doesn't care for me that way .
oh , but you care for her .
uncle , i just want us to stop trying to sabotage her .
that's all .
all right .
if that's what you really want .
i just want your happiness , my boy .
go to her .
congratulate her .
and tell her that we surrender .
thank you , uncle .
elsie kentworthy , please .
that's enough flaming ones for now .
are you sure i didn't burn you?
of course you did .
look at his coat .
no , no , it's very minor .
you just sort of seared the sleeve .
look .
sorry .
lilly?
yes?
can i talk to you for a second?
uh huh .
look over there .
should i shoo him?
should i shoo him?
just tell me who i should shoo and i'll shoo .
i just want to talk to nicholas for a second .
ok .
backing off , please .
andrew?
yes?
why don't you go introduce lilly to your parents?
you know , just tell them i'll be up for brunch in a second .
yeah , i'd love to meet susan and arnold .
we can have those tasty finger sandwiches together .
would you like some help?
he's not the one she's marrying , is he?
would you please try to keep up , brigitta?
he's trying to steal the crown .
ready?
mm hm .
take your stance .
ok .
elbow down .
just a bit .
use your mouth as an anchor .
excuse me?
touch your mouth .
good .
relax this hand .
and breathe in .
release .
oh .
how did that feel?
wonderful .
wonderful .
turn around .
we should give them some privacy .
i have to go .
i really only came back to pack my things .
you're leaving?
i think it's time i bowed out gracefully .
don't you?
goodbye .
bye .
goodbye .
mia .
could i see you one more time before i go?
nicholas , i'm watched like a hawk .
princess , princess .
see?
i'll find a way .
yes?
um , nothing .
i'm just supposed to watch you .
with only two and a half days left , olivia , i'm beginning to feel rather frantic .
would you take maurice out for me , please?
i have to check the orchestra selections .
and they asked you to approve a place setting for the reception , your majesty .
very well .
our selectiions for danciing at the royal receptiion .
have you been thinking about us?
yes , i have .
i see .
if you'll excuse me .
no , joseph .
you had to know what i was going to say .
mia needs me now more than ever before .
it's the monarchy .
i mean , as queen it's my responsibility .
you know how it is .
you were never just my queen , clarisse .
you were the someone that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with .
but , if you prefer that i see you first and foremost as my queen ...
i shall oblige .
no , joseph ...
your majesty .
your bed is turned down , your highness .
if you don't need anything else , princess , we're going to supper .
oh .
well , enjoy yourselves , ladies .
ah ah ah .
what did we talk about?
no more curtsy .
we're going to supper .
thank you .
hi , miss lilly .
may we announce you?
i can announce myself .
lilly moscovitz !
mia , look out your window .
why?
what's going on?
just look out your window .
prince charming is throwing pebbles .
nicholas .
nicholas , what are you doing?
rapunzel , rapunzel , with hair so fine .
come out your window , climb down the vine .
the feat you ask , dear sir , isn't easy .
and i won't respond to that line , it's far too cheesy .
so what does he want?
he wants me to climb down the vine .
well , do you want to?
yes .
so go .
it's a recipe for disaster .
mia , do something impulsive for once in your life .
you're getting married .
do you want a regular bachelorette party with 1 2 screaming girls , or do you want a stroll in the moonlight with your almost prince charming?
i always like a man in shades .
oh , your majesty .
no , no , ladies .
come in , come in .
i was just about to leave .
this really is more romantic in books .
my foot is stuck .
oh , what was that?
# frre jacques , frre jacques
# dormez vous?
dormez vous?
your majesty , we never got to finish our routine at the slumber party .
and there's more dancing , too .
# frre jacques , frre jacques
# dormez vous?
dormez vous?
and there's a big finish .
yes , the big finale .
i'm sorry .
did i hurt you again?
no , i ...
i'm used to it .
# sonnez les matines , sonnez les matines
# ding , dang , dong
# ding , dang , dong
what a pity we missed it at the party .
i'll cover for you .
go , rapunzel , go .
tell me your greatest desires .
tell me a secret .
lsn't that the same?
almost .
but anyone can see your desires .
no one knows what's in your heart .
tell me something .
um ...
i love i love lucy reruns .
and sometimes i dream in black and white .
i used to pretend i was sick when i had a test in school .
we all did that .
ok .
sometimes , i put chocolate milk on my cereal .
i am deathly afraid of jellyfish .
i haven't danced with you since your birthday .
that's a fact .
it's not a secret .
the secret is , is that ...
i still want to .
# love me tender
# love me sweet
# never let me go
# you have made
# my liife complete
# and i love you so
# love me tender
# love me true
# all my dreams fulfiill

good morning .
good morning .
hello .
we stayed out all night .
yes , we did .
we stayed out all night .
is that ...
there's a man in that boat .
what?
do you see that?
there's somebody over there .
he's probably some fisherman , i suppose .
with a video camera?
what?
you're really low .
no , mia .
i have no idea who that man is .
you know , it's really a shame he didn't get juicier stuff last night , you jerk .
mia , i have nothing to do with this .
i swear .
mia , please .
come on .
will you listen to me?
that is not my boat .
hey , nicholas?

andrew , i am so , so sorry .
excuse me .
andrew , please wait .
i promise you nothing happened .
yes , but mia , you still went , didn't you?
you went .
i don't think you understand .
i'm an extremely eligible bachelor in england .
i really am .
i've got plenty of friends , lots of lovely women friends , and ...
i still think this marriage is a good idea .
mia .
the queen would not approve of spying .
ah .
so?
anything?
i really want to say yes , but no .
there's just , there's no ... spark .
me too .
really?
really .
i mean , it was pleasurable .
very .
very pleasant , but , but , but no fireworks .
none .
what are we gonna do?
look , we will ...
we will figure something out .
mia .
you chose me .
no privacy .
you chose me , and i accepted .
and a gentleman never backs out on his word .
we are going to ...
we're going to stand up in church and say " i do , " and tomorrow we'll be man and wife .
and you are going to make an amazing queen of genovia .
thank you .
i'm getting married today .
she's getting married today , maurice .
your highness , we're running very late .
grandma says the queen is never late , everyone else is simply early .
your highness , a strange woman came in and said that she wanted to hide in your closet .
so i let her .
well , dear , that probably wasn't the wisest decision in the ...
now , this is what i call a closet .
mom .
oh , my darling .
careful .
we're squashing trevor .
hi .
hi , trevor .
he's sleeping .
shh .
he is the most beautiful baby brother .
we were joking .
we knew it was your mother .
your stepfather's here too .
now , i'm your mother , it's your wedding day , i have to say something .
being married is about being yourself , only with someone else .
thanks , mom .
how are you feeling?
you look beautiful .
i'm ...
well , i'm ...
you look so calm .
i'm a little ...
paolo is back to turn a caterpillar into a butterfly .
there she go , butterfly .
paolo .

i tell you , when i say " butterfly . " the coat comes off .
priinciipessa miia .
paolo .
you remember my mother , helen .
piiacere .
the hairdresser .
and a new baby .
monella .
all ltalian men love baby except paolo .
you got to get out now , because we have to go to work .
five years ago , paolo take you from that to that .
t oday , he give you this .
a wedding look for the bride .
i look like a moose .
yes , but a very cute moose .
make all the boy moose go ...
i have antlers .

i look like a poodle .
that's just the way i feel .
here we go again .

she kind of does look like a poodle .
i like it .
this time i'm so sure , i use my own pictures .
so .
un , deux , troiis .
gretchen?
i can't find my gloves .

i think it would be better if i didn't go to the wedding .
my boy .
don't give up so easily .
come to church .
sweep her off her feet .
in a week or two , she'll be yours .
the game is over , uncle .
she's going to marry andrew .
ah , you're so right .
ah , well .
this is a disaster in the making .
wouldn't miss a moment of it .
i'll try to catch the garter .
the royal carriage approaches .
what did he say , artie?
the princess is coming .
showtime .
suki sanchez here from the usa .
a long way from home , but happily following a story that started in the streets of san francisco , and is about to have a happy ending here in the small , beautiful land of genovia .
prepare for the arrival of princess mia .
psst .
sir .
i don't mean to talk out of school , but there's something you must know .
your uncle called elsie and set you up with that video .
why doesn't that surprise me?
i should have known .
he's up to something .
he was much too delighted that you aren't going to that wedding .
i must get to that church .
yes , yes , but how?
everything on four wheels is already rented for the wedding .
doesn't matter , i'll run .
no , no .
it's too far .
no , no .
you'll take the bike .
the bike?
gretchen , what bike?
we don't have a bike .
your grandfather's bike .
buenas tardes , tanya .
buenas tardes , su majestad .
aqu le presento a mii to , que nos viisiita de rosariio .
oh , how do you do , seor?
i do better if you and i get married .
i'm sorry .
my uncle learned his english watching the old three stooges movies .
sorry .
yes , well ...
you're not going to believe this .
lord devereaux's riding up the road on a bicycle .
sir !
sir , may i borrow your horse?
oh , he needs my horse .
my bike is yours .
how am i supposed to herd sheep with a bike?
outspoken american activist lilly moscovitz , the maid of honor , glides forward as a vision in pink .
i'm a girl who loves black and is wearing pink .
aww .
and duke andrew's little nephew , viscount ludlow , affectionately known as " james of the cherub cheeks . " comes down the aisle as the royal ring bearer .
hey , joe .
hm?
i just wanted to say , before i do this ...
i'm sorry you're retiring .
who told you that?
the maids know everything .
well , the heart does things for reasons that reason cannot understand .
you're preaching to the choir .
princess?
yes?
and you should know that nicholas did not set you up at the lake .
are you sure?
the maids know everything .
we're ready when she is .
is this part of the plan?
no .
i ...
i'm going to need a minute or two .
thank you , your highness .
now the bride is moving swiftly back up the aisle and out the door .
let me .
not the traditional route .
princess mia !
princess mia !
mia !
helen .
honey , i'll be right back .
i gotta change trevor's diaper .
please , be seated .
there'll just be a momentary interlude .
thank you .
do we rush after her?
no , we never rush .
we hasten .
you'll take care of this?
yes , yes .
yes , just one moment .
out of my way .
oh , my dear .
mia .
oh , grandma , i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
i ...
i just need a minute .
no .
i can do this .
no .
i can't do this .
i know .
darling , listen to me .
i made my choice .
duty to my country over love .
it's what i've always done , it seems .
it was drummed into me my whole life .
now i've lost the only man i ever really loved .
anyone got a 20 on joseph?
i'm with the eagle and sparrow .
mia , i want you to make your choices as a woman .
don't make the same mistakes i did .
make your own mistakes .
there'll be plenty of them , believe me .
now , you can go back into that church and get married , or you can walk away .
whatever choice you make ,
iet it come from your heart .
excuse me .
she's back .
the princess is reentering the church .
she's walking down the aisle .
more like cantering down the aisle .
andrew , wait .
everyone deserves the chance to find true love , right?
yes .
including us?
thank you .
for , for , uh ... saving me from doing the proper thing for once in my life .
now all i have to do is tell mummy .
i have to tell everyone else .
good luck .
helen .
welcome .
a few moments ago , i realized the only reason i was getting married was because of a law , and that didn't seem like a good enough reason .
so ...
i won't be getting married today .
sit .
sit .
there may be a dinner .
my grandmother has ruled without a man at her side for quite some time , and ...
i think she rocks at it .
so as the granddaughter of queen clarisse and king rupert ... king rupert .
may he rest in peace .
would you force them to do what you're trying to make me do?
i believe i will be a great queen .
i understand genoviia to be a land that combiines the beauty of the past wiith all the best hope of the future .
not now .
shh .
i feel in my heart and soul that i can rule genovia .
i ...
i love genovia .
do you think that i would be up here in a wedding dress if i didn't?
i stand here , ready to take my place as your queen .
without a husband .
viiva miia !
every time ...
every time this charming young lady opens her mouth , she demonstrates a contempt for the customs of genovia .
the law clearly states an unmarried woman cannot be queen .
fortunately , there is another heir .
no , there is not .
i decline .
i refuse to be king .
ladies and gentlemen , it is princess mia who should have the crown .
she's bright , and she is caring .
but more importantly , she has a vision .
one that will take genovia forward , and if the parliament were astute , they would name her queen .
listen to her .
she'll lead us into the 21 st century .
and besides , just think how lovely she'll look on our postage stamp .
lovely on a postage stamp?
you would look lovely on a postage stamp !
don't you walk away from me , sir !
you have a duty , sir , to genovia .
he's , uh ... he is very distressed .
your duty , sir , to the country !
to me , sir !
to genovia !
for your father !
nicholas !
the door .
shut the doors , quickly .
nicholas .
nicholas !
nicholas , i cannot have you giving all , all this up just for a girl .
now , look , we can still ...
enough , uncle .
we're finished .
what is happening here?
who's next in line for the throne?
the von trokens?
we accept .
sit down .
make a motion .
are you ok?
do you need a ...
make a motion .
ah .
prime minister?
yes , princess?
i move to abolish the marriage law , as it applies to present and future queens of genovia .
will anyone second my motion?
keep eye contact with them .
stare them down .
no , not , not ...
soften .
soften .
good .
i second the motion .
it's time we had a new tradition .
i like change .
i may grow a mustache .
i think you'd look marvelous with a mustache .
you know , my father always favored a van dyke ...
gentlemen , gentlemen .
please .
all those in favor of abolishing the marriage rule , say , " aye .
aye .
aye .
aye .
aye .
you're not in parliament .
sit down .
someday .
aye .
the ayes have it .
congratulations , princess .
if i may say so myself , you rule !
lionel .
your majesty?
hm?
the princess would like a word .
oh .
erm ...
grandma?
just because i didn't get my fairy tale ending , doesn't mean you shouldn't .
oh , uh ...
did you hear that?
not if you didn't want me to .
oh , charlotte .
well .
joseph?
your majesty .
dear joseph .
am i too late ... to ask you to accept my hand in marriage?
well , i thought you'd never ask .
shades?
you're in charge now .
good luck with lionel .
i'm going to a wedding .
open up , i say !
the door is shut .
let me iin .
put me down .
put me down !
i know it was short notice , but you were all dressed .
my lord archbishop , i would like to take this man as my husband , if you please .
finally .
we have come together for a different wedding ...
what did i miss?
she's not getting married .
she's not getting married?
no .
with this ring , i thee ... finally ... wed .
