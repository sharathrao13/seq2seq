the mouse , he churned that cream into butter .
that's right .

thank you .
frank , have you decided which hospital you want to work at here in new orleans?
well , um , to be quite honest
i'm thinking about getting back into law .
oh , my !
are you a doctor or a lawyer?
before i went to medical school , i passed the bar in california .
i practiced law for one year then i decided why not try my hand at pediatrics?
you're just full of surprises .
yeah .
oh , my .
a doctor and a lawyer .
well , i'd say that brenda hit the jackpot .
where did you go to law school?
uh , berkeley .
berkley , berkley .
oh , my gosh .
isn't that where you went , daddy?
maybe frank could come work for you , roger .
you're always saying how hard it is to find assistant prosecutors .
could he , daddy?
could he , please?
could he come work with you , please?
was that snake hollingsworth still teaching there when you went through berkley?
hollingsworth .
yes .
grumpy old hollingsworth , right?
i tell you .

and that dog of his?
tell me , frank , what was the name of his little dog?
i'm sorry .
uh ...
the dog was dead .
how unfortunate .
yeah .
a doctor , a lawyer , a lutheran ... so what are you , frank?
'cause i think you're about to ask for my daughter's hand in marriage and i have a right to know .

what are you doing here?
what is a man like you doing with brenda?

i'm not a doctor , i'm not a lawyer ...
i'm not an airline pilot .
i'm ...
i'm nothing , really .
i'm i'm i'm just a kid who's in love with your daughter .
no .
you know what you are?
you're a romantic .
men like us are nothing without the women we love .
i must confess , i'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy .
i proposed to carol after five dates with two nickels in my pockets and holes in my shoes because i knew she was the one . so go ahead , frank .
don't be afraid .
ask the question you came here to ask me .
sir , uh , uh ... w what would i have to do to take the bar here in new orleans?
no , the ... the other question .
right through that door .
good luck , mr. conners .
thank you .
hey , frank ... you know what i could never figure out?
how did you cheat on the bar exam in louisiana?
why?
what's the difference? someone else took the test for you , didn't they?
carl , i'm going to prison for a long time . seriously , what's the difference?
it's a simple question .
are you going to eat that eclair?
yeah .
i'm saving it for later .
well , you want to split it with me?
no .
give me half that eclair and i'll tell you .
i'm going to figure it out sooner or later .
you'll be working under phillip rigby in corporate law .
why don't you settle in , organize your desk?

with our guys , that's almost 100 men in one airport .

they didn't call 'cause it's not counterfeiting .
it's something else .
well , what is he doing?
he's making real checks , sir .
these are so perfect the airline didn't know the difference .
last check was cashed in madrid a week ago .
my guess is he's still there .
we have to leave now , sir .
today .
go where? spain?
you want to go to spain?
well , eventually , he's got to go back to where the checks were printed .
i think that's why he's moving back through europe .
look at the map , sir .
he's making a circle .
he's running out of checks .
i know it's a ... it's a long shot , sir but if we track him from madrid , sir , we could still catch him .
i'm sorry , carl , if you couldn't catch him here you're not going to catch him there .
but , sir , we're going to let him get away .
no , carl , you let him get away .

tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
will find it hard to sleep tonight ...

they know that santa's on his way ...

taking into account the gravity of these crimes your history of bold and elusive behavior and your complete lack of respect for the laws of the united states
i have no choice but to ignore your request to be treated as a minor and sentence you to 12 years in atlanta's maximum security prison and recommend strongly that you be kept in isolation for the entirety of that sentence . ... " merry christmas to you .
use that door over there .
... and give everyone my love .
i think about them all the time .
merry christmas , frank .

what's in the briefcase?
oh .
i'm on my way to the airport .
it's a paperhanger who's working his way through minnesota .
aw , geez , he's ... he's driving us crazy .
you got any of the checks?
yeah , yeah , i got a ... a counterfeit that he drew on the great lakes savings and loan . see , he's just using a stencil machine and an underwood .
yeah , it's a teller at the bank . say again?
i it's definitely a teller , carl .
i mean , banks , they always use hand stamps for the dates , see .
they get used over and over again so they always get worn out and the numbers are always cracking .
the sixes and the nines ... see , they go first .
thanks .
i'd like you to take a look at something for me .
tell me what you think .
that's a fake .
how do you know?
you haven't looked at it .
well , there's no perforated edge , right?
i mean , this ... this check was hand cut , not fed .
yeah ...
paper is double bonded much too heavy to be a bank check .
magnetic ink , it's , uh , raised against my fingers instead of flat .
and this doesn't smell like mlcr .
it's some kind of a ... you know , some kind of a drafting ink .
you know , the kind you get at a stationery store .
frank ... would you be interested in working with the fbl's financial crimes unit?
i already got a job here .
you know , i , uh , deliver the mail .
frank , we have the power to take you out of prison .
you'd be placed in the custody of the fbi where you'd serve out the remainder of your sentence as an employee of the federal government .
under whose custody?

i'm supposed to start work here today .
it's a tour company operating out of the bvl . sir , mr. abagnale is here .

oh , yeah , put him on .
mr. sawyer .
how are you?
i have a half a dozen more checks on that tour operator at the bvl .
american airlines 355 serving chicago and san francisco is now open for passenger check in .
how'd you do it , frank?
how'd you pass the bar in louisiana?
what are you doing here?
listen ...
i'm sorry i put you through all this .
you go back to europe , you're gonna die in perpignan prison .
you try to run here in the states we'll send you back to atlanta for 50 years .
i know that .
i spent four years trying to arrange your release .
had to convince my bosses at the fbi and the attorney general of the united states you wouldn't run .
why'd you do it?
you're just a kid .
i'm not your kid .
you said you were going to chicago .
my daughter can't see me this weekend . she's going skiing .
you said she was four years old .
you're lying . she was four when i left .
now she's 15 .
my wife's been remarried for 11 years .
i see grace every now and again .
i don't understand . sure you do . sometimes it's easier living the lie .
i'm going to let you fly tonight , frank .
i'm not even going to try to stop you .
that's 'cause i know you'll be back on monday .
yeah?
how do you know i'll come back?
look .
frank ... nobody's chasing you .
american airlines flight 131 to pittsburgh is now ready for boarding .
passengers with boarding passes , please proceed to gate 23a .
okay .
alice , has he still not called?
no , he hasn't .
good morning .
i've , uh , called this meeting to discuss a new type of check fraud and counterfeiting which the unsub is washing and altering checks then passing them throughout arizona .
this unsub is a big dog passing checks as large as five figures .
sorry i'm late . sorry .
we have a recovered check on agent reiter's desk .
why don't we step out to the bullpen?
there's impressions on every line .
looks like the original amount was for $60 .
mind if i take a look?
cashed in flagstaff a week ago .
cost the bank $16, 000 .
it's a real check .
yeah .
yeah .
it's been washed .
the only thing original is the signature .
but it's perfect , carl .
i mean ...
i mean , this isn't hydrochloride or bleach .
no . something new .
maybe a nail polish remover where the acetone removes the ink that's not been printed?
how did you do it , frank?
how did you cheat on the bar exam in louisiana?
i didn't cheat .
i studied for two weeks and i passed .
is that the truth , frank?
is that the truth?
i'll bet this guy steals checks out of mailboxes .
he washes off their names and he puts on his own .
you're saying that he's a local?
well , if it were me , you know
i'd call the bank first , i'd check out the balance ...
make sure there's enough money in there to make it worth your while .
exactly .
you know , carl , i think this guy's pretty smart .
i guess all we have to do now is catch him .
we'll start first thing in the morning .
we'll run the name eric anthony feeders .
in nevada , arizona , california .
both names , right?
chris frank , too?
yeah ...
