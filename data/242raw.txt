my lord , it's time , you have to leave .
they will have you arrested .
bring me some candles , i'm working late tonight .
but , my lord ..
and a glass of wine , as usual .
the world had no choice but to change ... .. but the revolution has become terror and me myself will be taken with away .
the certainties make people blind and mad .
they can tear their hearts apart and make a beast of themselves .
in the year 1764 ... ... the beast appeared on our grounds and made it his .
one year later it was known far beyond our region ... ... and people began to think nobody could ever defeat it .
by his attacks the gevaudan sunk deeper and deeper into the darkness .
stop ...
who are you?
what did he do?
he's a thief .
and she?
his daughter .
a witch .
i healed their horses and they refuse to pay .
do not listen .
a word has no meaning here .
are the horses healed?
yes .
go on .
welcome in the land of the beast .
and watch out for wolf traps .
knight gregoire de fronsac ... ... en the man called mani were hunters nor soldiers .
as taxidermist of the king .. ... the knight in paris the reputation of a free minded and ... intellectual person .
the one who was following him .. ... as his shadow was a stranger nobody knew of .
when evening fell ... ... they offered themselves to the castle of marquis apcher ... ... who gave them shelter as long as their mission in gevaudan would last .
our people are not afraid of an ordinary wolf .
the beast is different .
it flees from men like it knows it has to .. but it spares neither women nor children .
have you seen it?
no .
how do you know it's an animal then?
those who survived gave that description .
it's much bigger then a wolf and it doesn't fear bullets .
i understand your scepticism .
i don't believe in monsters either ... ... but i had a report made for you .. ... of the crimes of the beast .
you can judge yourself .
grandfather said you were fighting the english in canada ...
yes .
i went there to study the animals and nature . ... but i came back hurt and with the grade of captain .
i arranged a hospital for the victims of the beast .
in an old abbey .
a women from lorciere .
she came back from a party ... when the beast attacked her .
help came .
the beast vanished ... ... but it deformed her face ...
tell me , knight , how is mr buffon?
and how are things in paris?
and the innocent one?
read about it already?
it is kind of late for philosophy .
you're right .
how about the theatre?
do you know actresses?
what are they performing this winter?
put it right there .
people say she is courteous .
i'm not sure if it's true , but they offered their charms .
tell me .
with this your curiosity will be satisfied .
mercurius of france .
we only have the post of avignon .
i will show you the sleeping room .
he is sleeping over here .
good .
good night , knight .
it's not versailles , but the wine is good .
fat as a pig ...
jacques has seen many wolves .
what attacked him , was not a wolf .
the snout was longer and the teeth were like knifes .
if it's not a wolf , what is it then?
a devil .
knight .
the beast attacked a women in saint alban .
there .
don't worry knight , nobody is here .
stop .
what are they doing here?
son of a whore .
good day , captain .
sir marquis .
i greet you .
but be careful .
there are traps everywhere .
this is gregoire de fronsac , of the garden of the king .
he wants to see the body of this unlucky soul .
with your permission of course .
you treated my men merciless
i did not know they were acting in your command .
they were not .
you did good and i apologize .
my soldiers are made for war , not for hunting .
the intestines were emptied and now there is poison in it .
what kind of gardener are you?
when the beast is dead , the king wants it examined ... ... and save it in paris .
i have to stuff it after the hunt .
now i try getting familiar with it .
with such jaws the animal should weigh 250 kilos .
this time i will catch it .
before the first snow i will have it .
if everybody helps , it can't escape .
did you see it already?
once now .
in 13 months .
i shot it and hit it .
it collapsed but got up instantly again .
we lost it south of the mouchet .
did it look like this?
it had some sort of black bar ... with stings do you understand?
friends , let me introduce you the maker of the drawings .
knight gregoire de fronsac ... ... the man comes from paris to .. catch the beast .
his eminence , the bishop of mende .
his eminence , the duke of moncan
his eminence , the count of morangias ... .. and mrs. count and their son jean francois ... ... who has traveled a lot too ...
good , my lord .
thank you , my lord .
my lord laffond , our intendant .. .. and the priest of saint alban , henrie sardis .
tell us , my lord ...
are people talking a lot about the beast in paris?
people even sang about it .
they should prey .
would captain duhamel need gods help?
who can without god's help?
duhamel disguises his soldiers in women .
to get the beast .
what a strategy .
duhamel does all he can .
i think you're obliging .
duhamel is incapable .
they destroy a lot .
but the beast is still there .
like taxes are meant to be for paying duhamel ... ... i rather give it to my servants .
what do you think?
my lord duke likes carp at , but he is a good christian .
when you arrived , they were boring me ... ... with the good god and all that holy talk .
the pope would even have sent a spy ... ... to see if the beast has anything to do with the devil .
excuse me .
marianne de morangias .
difficult , very difficult .
everybody was breaking their minds about it .
who is next?
maxime des forets .
actor .
that will be easy .
be careful .
he's a morangias ...
mrs ..
hello , my lord , we were talking ..
are you maxime des forets?
what a pleasure .
good actors are rare .
the marquis was talking about you .
the marquis?
he wants to have a chronicle written about his family .
he's thinking about you .
is he?
he is in a good mood .
it's now or never .
but act like you don't know and let him start talking about it .
mrs. excuse me ....
aren't you ashamed?
my god .
no .
so , mr. stuffer ... do you like our region?
until now i only saw beauties .
or at least one of them .
do people talk about girls this way in the court?
no ...
something like this you should save for the innocent farmers .
i would go to the court if there were women like you .
food is being served , knight .
let's eat .
i'll follow you .
we were in saint laurent for 12 days already when we found the most ..
.. bizarre animal in our nets i ever saw
the indians told me about holy fish ... ... but i was convinced it was a legend .
i saw a fish with the looks and size of a trout . ... but it's body was completely covered with a hairy skin as black as poison .
a hairy trout?
you're joking .
no , my lord .
salmo truta dermopilla , from canada .
that is really strange .
as soft as fur .
nature is extraordinary .
the water will be cold ...
it proves the impossible is possible sometimes .
with this discovery you earned a lot of respect .
i doubt he deserves that .
but i admit , knight , you got talent as an actor .
if i would have two hands , i would give an applause .
jean francois .
please excuse him , my lord .
your son is right , sr. earl , that animal doesn't exist .
my embalmer in the garden of the king is very handy .
so you say the beast does not exist ... .. and we are idiots?
i only say that ... people only used dragons or squirrels in books or poems .
lies are sometimes true if they are being told correctly .
watch out , my lord .
we might not understand you anymore now .
by the way , are you a philosopher?
or worse ... an actor?
i think the knight is mainly someone from paris .
enough about that beast .
shall we do some riddles?
i just made a poem .
if mrs. earl allows ...
if it's not immoral .
immoral?
no , no .
it's very chaste and sober .
it's not far fetched .
just popped into my head .
it's called " the wolf " .
i didn't pay any attention to it .
without thinking of evil , i look at you
your secret glance strikes me .
the wolf , the wolf , the wolf
will i see you again soon?
do you have any other mystical animals?
u have an indisputable idea about me .
allow me to change that .
try it .
will you be attending duhamel's battue?
yes .
i forbid you .
it's far too dangerous .
obedience is the first virtue of young women .
that young man is right .
it was on that day the biggest battle ever to be held in gevaudan took place .
the king promised 6 . 000 pound to the one who killed the beast .
thousands of peasants and soldiers joined the hunters .
during a few hours we forgot we were hunting the beast .
everyone got a map and a place to assemble .
we start at 7 .
go ahead .
my people have other things to do .
your generosity matches your courage and ...
enough .
i hope for your sake that we catch it this time .
that's a certainty , sir duke .
what kind of racket is that?
a beautiful weapon , not?
i had it made by a weapons blacksmith in mende .
you understand that i wanted it custom made .
look ... ... even in paris you can't find such bullets .
i mold them myself .
silver?
you fear werewolves?
no , but i want to leave a signature .
i'm a hunter .
its a passion that has cost me a lot .
what happened to you?
i've learned that some predators need more then a bullet .
there's more to curing gangrene then a prayer .
has a bear wounded you?
a lion .
2 years in the marine made me travel a lot .
you don't know africa , fronsac .
gentlemen ... my daughter is to blame .
i'll bring her here .
punish her accordingly .
a witch .
the daughter of the devil .
look at her , a demon .
she's sick , she's not possessed .
she's not possessed .
the evil .
the sign of the devil .
bewitched .
make sure she doesn't swallow here tongue .
she will suffocate .
she's not possessed .
she's not possessed i know
taxidermist , philosopher ...
and even a healer .
congratulations .
she didn't come .
marquis .
and the people?
superstitious .
nothing different than this place .
the indians eat the heart of their prey , for its strength .
is that why they are savages?
in africa they eat the heart of their enemies .
sir duke , jean francois , move your people eastwards .
there you are .
your mother will be worried .
if i had listened to her , i wouldn't be in the convent .
i know you don't believe me , you're a free thinker .
not when one is in love .
are you in love?
ridiculous .
we hardly know each other .
you think that its about you?
marianne .
she has to learn to ride like a woman .
practice never hurt anyone .
my father never sees any evil .
my son sees evil in everything .
people died here .
how do you know that?
i hear their screams .
mani , stop that .
he's right .
there was an army camp here .
when it was torched , 25 heretics died .
is he psychic?
that's not needed .
to observe is sufficient .
when i was little , i came to play here with my brother .
weren't you afraid?
he would protect me against the ghosts .
don't you like the hunt?
is that a crime around here?
according to indian custom , you steal someone's soul if you draw them .
does my soul interest you?
why on foot?
do you want to get mutilated?
it's my fault .
i ask nothing of you .
what was that?
only a wolf .
and what if it was the beast?
i don't think it was , marianne .
thanks .
i hope the beast is one of the wolves .
they wont be eating anyone .
what a special person .
where did you find him?
in canada .
it's ...
how does one say it .
an acad?
an indian .
an irok , from the tribe of the mohawks .
an indian?
a real one?
he doesn't look like an indian .
make sure that you're in saint alban tonight .
we'll entertain ourselves with your servant .
he's not my servant .
what is he then , cursed?
my brother .
how can you mix your blood with that of a savage?
he who shares my discomfort , is no savage .
because of mani i was able to escape from the english .
i thought those animals were cannibals .
as you can see , sir intendant , mani is no animal .
would you be able to procreate with a woman of our race?
all women are equal once the candles are extinguished .
yes , they're clear of mind .
the indians slept with white men and had children .
we are equals .
that's said hasty .
it's a bit like with black men ...
what do you think of it , sardis?
your blood brother must be a child of god .
you had him baptized?
he didn't ask me .
good .
you follow times closely .
mani has his own believe .
he was some sort of priest in his tribe .
do indians have priests?
they are lost .
what is their believe?
every human has a congenial with the animals .
a totem
nice , but i don't understand .
would you mind?
don't be afraid .
it won't hurt .
u ...
caribou ... thats some kind of deer .
yes , a deer .
what do you think?
am i a deer by the horns or by somebody else?
and my dear thomas?
what is his .. ... totem?
worm .
a book worm .
a snake?
snake?
with the indians , snakes stand for wisdom
wise snake .
and you , my lord intendant?
a pig .
away with those wrinkles .
with those barbarians the pigs may represent nobility .
who is next?
sardis?
no .
no
and me?
what am i?
half a lion , half an eagle?
change me in a lizard , so my arm will grow back on .
jean francois .
enough .
what's wrong?
am i going too far?
let me , let me .
mrs. , would you?
excuse me , but your tricks bore me .
i choose to withdraw , before you start dancing on a ball .
good evening .
that will relax you .
it's not paris , but it's the best mende offers .
and it sleeps better than in an inn .
they are all for you , gentlemen .
and we have a new ...
my dear marquis , come .
i'm expensive , gregoire de fronsac .
do we know each other?
from here gevaudan looks small .
italian?
a passage in this beautiful country .
i got some money .
thats not the only issue .
and?
who did that?
an irokese arrow .
your heart was not far away ..
maybe i am .. a man with luck .
and that?
a bear .
and he didn't love me .
you haven't seen anything yet .
i have a dangerous job .
not all men have manners like you .
that's a recollection on me .
that is a scandal in my house .
valentine .
what is this?
i don't sleep with wizards .
what does it mean?
he got snakes on his body .
our reputation is at risk .
it's nothing , it is an indian .
not a wizard .
i don't want indians .
you hookers are difficult .
and , girls?
who's going with the redskin?
i double the price .
i like his sketches ...
well , everything is gonna be alright ...
are you a wizard?
are you going to sketch me?
if your not honest .
several weeks passed ... ... and the soldiers couldn't find the beast .
it was the 3th winter under his lordship ... ... and we knew the snow and the cold ... ... just like our weapons , would not make it stop .
think about the threatens god announced through moses 'mouth ..
i will come to you like a bear lost her whelps
i shall tear your children like a lion .. and send the beast that will consume you .. and your cattle , and will make ... deserts of your roads .
how long will you stay angry , lord?
one candle per victim .
do you really think we live in a rational time?
mercy .
i ask forgiveness .
mercy .
bless me .
what is it , my son?
god punished me .
my children are gone .
i'm doomed .
we're all doomed .
gather your men , we leave at once .
warn mani , i see you on the way .
good evening , friend of the wolves .
i've got something for you .
i would like to speak with you , marianne .
alone .
in 10 days my mother and father will both go away .
10 days?
i am not as free as you are .
bring me the torch .
bring the torch .
the storm starts and they are tired .
we'd better go home .
no .
let's find the girl .
i found the child .
captain , those traps you set catch more farmers than wolves .
your men are leaded by misuse of power .
and since your chase the wolf has killed 12 times .
i don't understand .
it shouldn't have escaped .
what?
it shouldn't have escaped .
and you , knight , do you know what kind of wolf it is?
gentlemen ...
the only certainty i have , is that it's not a wolf .
a wolf does not attack people .
i observed them in canada .
maybe there the wolves are different .
a wild wolf would attack anybody .
if it gets frantic , it will die in 2 weeks .
and still it's running around here for 2 years now .
by the way , i saw wounds a wolf could never have made .
and i found , in a body of a victim , a piece of iron .
and?
and?
no animal has iron teeth .
is the beast not an animal then?
well , how do we catch it?
as we are talking , it kills people .
i think we should listen carefully to fronsac .
so , knight , you think the beast is not an ordinary animal .
i'm glad you admit its something extraordinary .
i don't admit anything sir .
i only have my doubts .
knight , do you have something left to say?
no gentlemen .
gentlemen , i received this from paris .
captain duhamel , his majesty was informed about your mistakes .. ... and i was asked to get you off this case .
you and your men leave at once to your regiment in langogne .
sir beauterne is already on his way to langogne .
his majesty gave orders to kill the wolf . ... and he is the only one who is allowed to hunt in the district .
gentlemen .
have you forgiven me?
i would like to know my totem?
do i say that properly?
i would say ... ... a mermaid .
you are never serious .
i will ask your red skinned man .
and the beast?
did you see it?
no .
don't you want to talk about it?
i could only make some absurd suppositions .
when i say the beast is made of flesh and iron ... ... that it can think and disappear when it wants to .
what would you think?
that our air would make you talk nonsense .
people would think that it hides for me .
you haven't been long here and you already want to be finished .
did you think the beast would surrender that easily?
maybe it's scared of you .
am i so scary then?
you enjoy a lot more from a difficult victory .
jean francois said you wanted to go to africa .
it's a dream of a taxidermist who is fed up with the winter .
and you?
don't you want to discover other regions?
the women have more duties then desires .
do you see sardis on the walls?
does he keep an eye on you?
no
it watches me .
alone with you in the park .
who knows what will happen .
come , the priest will catch a cold .
good night , knight .
good night , knight .
you're in love .
i don't know .
i know .
the maps?
i didn't need them for you .
let us drink .
to mrs. morangias .
why?
her brother was there too that night .
did you sleep with him?
with him?
he is not to be touched .
he looks , he drinks ... ... and when he's drunk , he talks in his sleep .
like all men .
do i talk in my sleep?
what do i say then?
do you know how florentine women keep their men at home?
they give their husbands slowly working poison each morning . ... and each night an antidote .
men who sleep elsewhere will have a bad night because of that .
a women like you doesn't need that .
and by the way , we're not married .
make room for antoine de beauterne .. ... carrier of his majesty , who will release the region .. ... of the beast .
my lord , i am gregoire de fronsac .
oh i remember .
the servant of buffon .
the taxidermist and embalmer .
he sleeps with the intendant .
we have an appointment at 2 exactly .
his majesty asked me your opinion about your report .
complicated fables ...
i think the beast is a wolf .
tomorrow i will leave to investigate .
i don't want you to join me .
why not?
the king wants me to do it .. ... and me alone ..
i don't need you to complete this .
you'll find a letter signed by buffon on the table .. ... and our beloved king .
i am inferior to him .
but believe me , it's not ...
i read your report .
don't waste energy for the beast anymore .
i will take care of it .
you can go .
come , come , come .
come .
a women from lorciere .
she came back from a party .
we lost it south of the mouchet .
it just disappeared .
knight , the beast attacked a women in saint alban .
god punished me , my children are gone .
no more than you i believe in monsters .
his snout was longer and the teeth are like knifes .
the only certainty is that it's not a wolf .
it's not an animal?
a frantic wolf attacks everyone .
how do we catch it?
no animal has iron teeth .
knight , you have to come at once .
i saw it .
he poured poison and said satanic words .
god knows how long this has been going on .
let him be .
it's an indian remedy .
only our prayers can save her
but ....
she was not ...
a miracle .
tell me .
what happened to your brother?
a man with the beast .
she doesn't know what she is saying .
yes , my lord .
the beast is dead .
ten bullets .
it didn't survive .
we brought the necessary .
start at once .
that's not the beast .
start .
mr. beauterne is coming .
ridiculous .
this is not the beast .
like i said , mr. beauterne is coming .
i don't like the way you work .
bye , knight .
leave us .
and , fronsac?
don't you like my beast?
what's the meaning of this?
you know this is not the beast .
his jaws are twice as big as these .
you got everything to fix that .
i must bring the beast to paris , and i got this wolf .
you should make a beast for me .
do you want the king to believe ..
no , fronsac .
i carry out his will .
you should too .
that would be wise .
are you threatening me , my lord?
on my age?
you know who i am .
541 01 : 02 : 43, 760 > 01 : 02 : 46, 718 ... and you're too intelligent to have yourself threatened .
if you do your job , the king will be grateful .
if you don't do your job he will be very disappointed .
do you have everything you need?
i'm counting on you .
see you soon .
