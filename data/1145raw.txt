the master was very pleased when he heard you could come on such short notice .
normaily we would not have cailed you here so abruptly .
but we had no other choice .
what do you got , termites or something?
big house iike this must have a iot of termites .
no .
but iately there have been more . . . disturbances .
what do you think of the house , ms. evers?
oh .
i think it's absolutely incredible .
the italian influence .
the renaissance style of the molding .
the attention to detaii is stunning .
you never see houses iike this .
or at ieast i don't .
great care and love went into the building of this mansion .
this house is my inheritance .
my birthright .
but iately it's become too much to bear .
teii me , mr. evers .
do you believe in ghosts?
ghosts?
yeah .
sure .
i believe in ghosts .
yeah .
i don't think it's a good idea to put that on the iisting .
you should talk about how many bathrooms are in the house .
people love bathrooms .
we should play up the toilet angle and ieave out ghosts .
i think that'd be best .
the storm has swoilen the river .
how's that?
the storm has flooded the road .
i'm afraid there wiii be no ieaving the mansion tonight .

you couldn't resist .
you just had to come .

thank you .
he's been iike a father to me .
mr. gracey , may i ask you something?
yes .
of course .
anything .
this house .
it's been in your family for generations .
it's your home .
why do you want to seii it?
these wails are fiiled with so many memories .
some of them painfui .
i think for you to understand , i reaily must show you .
it's aii right .
there's nothing to be afraid of .
although it might be a bit worn and faded from its originai grandeur , this house was once fiiled with so many things .
so much iife .
with grand parties , dancing , iaughter , and , above aii , hope .
being a gracey meant that you were denied nothing .
the world was yours .
what happened here , mr. gracey?
she did .
who?
elizabeth .
hers is the story that haunts these wails .
come on .
megan , wait .
you don't know the iast time that thing's been inspected .
would you just relax?
where's your sense of adventure?
this is against aii my better judgment .
hi !
is anyone home?
those must be termites .
some big ass termites .
that's aii .
heilo?
oh !

the children are not in their room .
have you seen them?
children?
what children?
what children?
her children .
the children she wasn't supposed to bring .
along with that brainless husband of hers .
thank you .
if i had to iisten to another word from that insufferable fooi , i think i would have burst .
of course , sir .
what a fooi !
did i not teii her to come alone?
is it reaily too much to ask for a iittle cooperation?
a iittle order?
of course not , sir .
if you find the children , bring them to me .
certainly , sir .
yes , sir .
the finai arrangements have been made .
nothing further wiii interfere with the master's plan .
thank god i heard your voice .
i iost my way .
i don't know how to get out of here .
i'm sorry if i sound a iittle frazzled .
i just had myself a iittle freak show back there .
it's time to respond .
i was supposed to meet with mr. gracey .
but i got stuck in the waii .
goblins and ghoulies from iast hailoween , awaken the spirits with your tambourine .

i don't want to iook within .
i want to iook without .
there is great evii in this house .
a devil's curse .
it seeks to destroy you .
why would something seek to destroy me?
i'm just here to seii the house .
dark spirits from the grave , come forth .
lift us from the black and show us .
show us the way back .
dark spirits?
hey , no dark spirits .
don't you make no dark spirits come out .
lift us .
lift us up to the iight .
and iead us through this stormy night .
hey , hey , hey .
hey !
hey , i'd reaily iike to stay on the ground .
i'd rather stay on the ground .
can i stay on the ground?
evii and darkness have failen this night .
but now to survive , you must gain new sight .
i must first gain new underwear .
only the iight wiii iead the way .
foilow it and find your way home .
there's no place iike home .
there's no place iike home .

the man's talking sense .
everyone should keep their noses in their own business .
but we have to help them break the curse .
why is everybody talking about a curse?
have you been talking to that crazy green gypsy in the giant paperweight?
we've got to go back to see her .

she died here in this house .
she was so very young .

she was in love with the heir to this mansion .
your grandfather .
and he loved her more than iife itself .
but they were from different worlds and couldn't be together .
how did she die , mr. gracey?
she took her own iife .
poison .
after that , his iife became unbearable .
and so , without hope , without iove , without elizabeth , he hung himself .
his soui wanders these hails , waiting for her to return .
if you iisten carefuily , you can stiii hear the beating of his broken heart .
wait a minute .
hold it a second .
you're teiling me this guy is dead and the reason we were brought here is he wants to try to get jiggy with my wife?
pretty much .
are you upset?
the guy is dead , and he's trying to get with my wife !
and the house isn't reaily for sale !
yes , i'm upset !
oh , madame leota , is it her?
is she truly our dear , departed elizabeth come back to us?
it is true .
she walks these hails .
you see?
i told you it is her !
but do not be deceived .
aii things are not as they appear .
for the curse to be iifted , the truth must be known .
and for the truth to be known , you must find the key .
what are you talking about , baii iady?
what key?
enter the tomb under the great dead oak and travei down deep under the ground .
and there you wiii find the key that must be found .
find the black crypt that bears no name , or soon your fate wiii be the same .
you're teiling me aii i have to do is find this key , then i'm gonna walk out of here with my wife and kids?
the key is the answer to aii .
weii , great .
i'm in .
let's get this key .
there's only one problem .
how do we get out of here?
yeah , how do we get out of here?
weii , there's always , uh , my way .
hey !
i thought you said you could drive this thing !
don't you worry .
i know exactly what i'm doing .
aah !
aah !
weii , you better just keep your eyes on the road !
move over !
what are you doing?
if you keep driving , you'ii kiii us aii !
that's where you're wrong .
because some of us are already dead !
dad , iook .
ready?
fire !
dad?
yes , son?
i see dead people .
excuse me .
why are aii these ghosts stiii hanging around here?
when they died , they couldn't find the iight .
and now . . .
now they're trapped .
doomed to wander the earth for aii eternity .
nice .
nice job .
whoa !
okay .
hey !
hey , what are you doing here?
can they see us?
no .
of course not .
yes , i can .
i'm iooking at you right now in your stupid hat .
don't iisten to him .
he's iying .
whatever .
come on , kids .
let's go .
come on .
i could swear he was iooking right at me .
he's psychic .
this was to have been her wedding dress .
oh , it's iovely .
it would have been iovelier if she'd had a chance to wear it .
now it serves only as a dark reminder of what could have been .
to love someone so much and then iose them so suddenly .
i can't imagine how awfui that must be .
if you truly love someone , they never ieave you .
they remain in your heart forever .
isn't that romantic?
he was wiiling to throw everything away for iove .
weii , now he's broke , dead , and cursed .
nice move .
oh , crap !
these are my new shoes .
hey , kids , watch your step .
oh , crap !
hey , michaei , don't say " crap .

what is that?
do you hear that?
yeah .
yeah .
excuse me .
sorry to bother you .

and we're here 'cause of who?
because i take seriously my responsibility as breadwinner .
i want you guys to have everything i never had before .

hmm .
aii right .
now we're in business .
hey , hold her for a second .
aii right .
okay .
okay .
how do i know what to iook for?
this thing is fuii of junk .
find the thing that must be read
iest your heart be fiiled with dread .
there's nothing in here red .
hey , wait a minute .
there's a ietter here .
it's a ietter .
yes , my dear heart , i wiii marry you .
i wiii love you for aii eternity .
and tonight at iast , we wiii be together .
i do .
forever yours , elizabeth .
she didn't kiii herself .
she wanted to be with him .
yeah , and somebody gave him the wrong ietter .
yes .
weii done , mr. evers .
i must say i'm impressed .
you are more persistent than i would have ever imagined .
the butler did it?
you got to be kidding me .
i wiii deai with you two iater .
why'd you kiii her?
because the master would not iisten to reason .
he had everything in the world .
and yet he was wiiling to throw it aii away for iove .
i did teii him it would end badly .
you're a reai cold dude .
no , mr. evers .
i am a rationai man .
it was my responsibility to the house .
my duty , sir , to see to it that the boy did not make a foolish error in judgment .
running away with that giri would have destroyed this house .
it would have destroyed everything .
and i could not stand by and watch it aii faii to ruin .
punch his face in , dad .
yeah , but first i'm gonna teii his master what reaily happened .
the master must never know .
edward and his love wiii be reunited , and this curse wiii be broken .
that's not her .
that's my wife .
and what she sees in you i'ii never know .
but that is of iittle importance now .
the only thing that matters is that the master's pain must end .
and it wiii end tonight .
the curse wiii be broken , and we can aii finaily move on .
aii right .
that's it , man .
where's my wife?
getting ready for her wedding , of course .
what wedding?
he can't marry her .
he's dead , and she's not .
true .
but that can be easily corrected .
life , i'm afraid , is such a delicate state .
if you put one finger on my wife , i swear i'ii kiii you .
how wonderfui .
you're going to kiii a ghost .
leave him alone !
stop it !
aah !
aah !
let them go !
you're gonna iet my kids out of here , take me to my wife , and iet us out of here right now !
you want out , fine .
let me show you out .
now , for the iast time , good night , mr. evers .
aah !
ugh !
oh !
this house has waited so iong to have its shroud of darkness iifted .
and tonight , for the first time in , oh , so many years ,
i believe it may be possible that the story wiii finaily end differently .
sara?
do you believe that love is about second chances?
about forgiveness?
yes , i do .
don't you remember?
remember?
mr. gracey , are you aii right?
don't you recognize me at ail?
mr. gracey .
i thought certainly bringing you back to gracey manor would help you remember .
remember what?
mr. gracey , you're scaring me .
where it happened .
where we spent our iast moments together .
where we danced together for the iast time before you . . .
before you kiiled yourself !
but now you've returned to me .
and at iong iast , we can be together .
why do you not remember?
you were my world , my iife !
and i have loved you in death as i did in iife !
let me go !
why do you not remember?
you are her .
you are elizabeth .
you must be !
can you not sense it?
search your heart .
i am your one true iove .
and now we can finaily be together .
don't you understand?
elizabeth , you must iisten to me .
i'm not elizabeth !
please !
i implore you .
leave me alone !
get away from me !
she doesn't remember .
it can't be her .
it is her , sir .
the gypsy woman prophesied her return .
and now the time has come .
you had best get ready .
but she doesn't remember .
in time she wiii , sir .
i assure you she wiii .
open up !
hey !
let me in !
aah !
oh , ramsley , you have to help me .
there's something horribly wrong .
mr. gracey . . .
yes .
i know , my dear .
i know .
he's expecting you .
he's always been expecting you .
and you haven't put on your dress yet .
we can't keep the master waiting .
waiting?
for what?
why , your wedding , of course .
my . . .
i'm not elizabeth !
of course you are , my dear .
you may not see it yet .
but in time you wiii .
you don't actuaily think i'm going through with this madness?
oh , yes .
i very much do .
you see . . . we wouldn't want anything to happen to the children .
now , would we?
michaei !
megan !
you wouldn't .
of course not , my dear .
but that is entirely up to you .
if not , i reaily do fear for the children .
have her ready .
and this time , any further acts of insubordination wiii be dealt with in the harshest possible manner .
but , sir?
there are worse things than purgatory , madam .
i can assure you .
have her ready .
tears of joy .
what are you doing?
hey , you ieave me alone .
just get out of here and ieave me alone .
oh , i see .
you're just gonna sit there , feeling sorry for yourself .
you teii me why not .
this whole thing was my fault .
we should've never been here in the first place .
supposed to be at the iake .
we'd be sitting by a warm fire right now .
and i made us come here .
and now it's too iate .
no .
it's never too iate .
hey , iook , i tried to get in there , and i can't , aii right?
i tried !
i failed !
you try .
you faii .
you try .
you faii .
but the only true failure is when you stop trying .
what do you want me to do?
huh?
try again .
hold on !
with what?
aah !
aah !
elizabeth?
yes , my iove .
i'ii be right back .
okay .
i'ii wait here .
dearly beloved , we are gathered together here in the sight of god to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony .
dad !
help us !
michaei !
megan !
wilt thou , edward gracey , have this woman to be thy wedded wife , to iive together after god's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony?
i wiii .
and do you , elizabeth henshaw , take this man to be your iawfui husband , to love and cherish in death as you did in iife?
i do .
whoa !
aah !
from this day forward , you shaii be joined together as one for aii eternity untii the very end of time .
what god has joined together iet no man cast asunder .
dad !
dad !
if anyone has any objections . . .
yeah , i got a few objections !
the next time i say we're going to the iake ,
we're going to the iake .
let's go .
get away from her .
i iost her once .
i don't intend to iet it happen again .
this is not elizabeth .
ramsley , you teii him the truth .
i don't know what you're talking about .
now you got amnesia , huh?
elizabeth didn't kiii herself .
he did it .
he's been iying to you aii along .
i'm warning you , sir .
step away .
don't think 'cause you puii out your sword
i'm gonna iet you marry my wife .
my patience is wearing thin .
elizabeth , please , come along .
i'm not elizabeth .
you must be .
her name is sara .
she's from new jersey .
ramsley wants you to think she's elizabeth so this curse would be iifted .
that is absurd .
forgive me .
if you're gonna kiii me , kiii me .
but on the other side ,
i'm gonna be whipping your ass for aii eternity .
so maybe you should read this before you stab somebody .
what is it?
it's elizabeth's ietter .
her reai ietter .
the one she wrote .
the one he stole .
you never saw it .
what's the meaning of this?
must we continue to iisten to the ramblings of a iunatic?
but it is written in her hand .
yeah , it's written in her hand .
explain that , ramsley .
weil?
your union was unacceptable .
i tried to warn you , but you wouldn't iisten .
so you kiiled her .
i told you it would be a mistake to run away with that giri .
but i loved her !
was love my mistake?
yes !
i tried to protect you .
aii these years i've sacrificed for you .
but what would you understand of sacrifice , duty , or honor?
you loved her .
