how's that for a picture?
a nice shot .
it's fabulous .
just like a postcard .
is that the view from the hotel?
we had that aerial up there .
and those smelly old mattresses .
ellen was completely out of it after three cocktails .
she was so smashed there !
she was so pissed there !
he's making me out to be a drunk .
i don't find that funny .
they had 32 cocktails !
32 !
could you please take that awful slide off now?
it's embarrassing .
if i worked in television i'd use it as the test card .
you're mean .
that's how he sharpens his beak .
careful !
stop it , you two .
carry on .
oh , all right .
looks like someone shit in the sea .
that reminds me of my childhood at the lake .
i'm swimming along and see a floating turd .
when i came up i had a pile of shit on my head .
sleep well .
bye .
close the window , it's cold .
i'll drive .
i'll drive .
no , i'll drive .
you've had too much .
i can drive .
katrin !
yes?
i'll call you to make a date .
fine .
i could pick you up or something .
bye .
wave goodbye .
time for beddy byes .
yes .
she can really get on your nerves .
yes , she's unbearable at times .
she never stops talking !
i know .
i think she's unhappy with him .
oh , i don't know .
that was horrible of you .
what?
showing the picture .
what picture?
that awful one of me .
i was embarrassed .
i thought ...
can't hear you .
i thought it was mean .
that was really rotten of you .
it wasn't exactly flattering .
and then you leave ...
what's that in your hair?
then you leave it on the screen for ages .
you know how i hate that .
stop it now .
it's embarrassing .
i mean , when we're alone ...
when we're alone i don't mind but not when we have guests over .
there's no need for that .
some of mine were terrible too .
did you see those?
what do you want me to say?
i've found another shot .
down the hatch !
i mean a slide .
look at all the ash .
i wish you'd use this properly .
you've got to tip the ash inside .
oh shit !
shit , shit , shit !
it's 5 : 49 on radio 24 , playing hits of the last 24 years .
broadcasting from the 24th floor of the oder tower .
this is magic chris .
coming up , your personal horoscope .
good morning !
12 .
this is chris .
power from the tower .
good morning .
mascha , gregor !
get a move on , it's late .
hurry up .
get a move on .
we're running late .
bye , darling .
bye , gregor .
you be good now .
hello .
no , this is ellen speaking .
ellen , really?
i wanted to remind katrin to buy food because my daughter is coming today .
so she must have left her mobile there last night .
morning .
so , everything ready?
planning on tooting here all day?
do you speak german?
speak any german?
yes .
you hanging around all day?
why not?
because i find it a bit irritating .
i take breaks .
i'll come for something to eat .
well , that's good .
maybe you could stand down there near the lamppost .
fine , but only because it's you .
i appreciate it .
i'll treat you to a beer later on .
i mean , i normally love music but ...
radio 24's magic hour with your horoscope for today .
the stars favour change .
put an abrupt end to all that boredom and try to spice up a dull day .
as you know , life is too short .
and this is to all taureans .
receive unexpected visitors with open arms .
be sure to stock up your fridge .
hi .
come in .
sure?
yes .
got the phone .
i've got to go on .
sure .
hang on .
i'll only be ten seconds .
and that was britney spears .
next up is the happy hour with knut from the tower .
a kiss from chris .
quite a session last night .
indeed .
there you go .
that's katrin !
i imagined this place to be bigger .
it's only a computer and a mixer .
it's big enough .
want to have a go?
say something .
hello .
announce the time .
33 .
i think i'll leave that to you .
you have a fantastic view .
it's even better from here .
you can see poland , the stadium .
you okay , knut?
you look and sound tired .
knut , this is my girlfriend .
no , i mean this is ...
this is ...
my friend's girlfriend .
she's my wife's friend .
whatever .
would you excuse me now?
i have to go .
so do i.
a nice evening , wasn't it?
this thing takes ages .
four .
i serve sausages , chips and schnitzel all day .
soup is always popular .
not surprising at 2 marks 50 .
people like my soup .
business is going well .
how long do you stay open?
well , it depends .
i'm usually here till 10 .
in the summer till 12 .
sometimes we stay open till 3 .
i mean , if it's someone's birthday i'll be stuck here till 3 .
i don't mind though .
but it makes it difficult to spend time with the family .
you shouldn't be filming this .
i'm not supposed to smoke in here .
if the health inspector turns up i'm in trouble .
i'll have to pay a 20 mark fine .
20 marks?
yes .
seriously?
yes , 20 .
what happened , uwe?
oh shit , i don't believe it .
that's all i need .
i'm sorry .
we were supposed to meet .
there's not much time .
we're really busy .
my break doesn't last forever .
all right !
look at how full this place is .
i'm so thirsty !
eberhard?
yes?
got half an hour?
yes .
can you fill in?
we're buying a kitchen .
hello .
we want to look at some kitchens .
fine , go ahead .
could you make a hamburger?
it's almost ready .
okay .
my break is almost over .
we have to hurry .
i'd like to know why we're looking at kitchens anyway .
oh , come on .
you always put a damper on things .
you've seen our place .
and our kitchen .
there's no room for a proper kitchen .
there's space even in the smallest place .
you always spoil it .
i've lost interest .
i see it as a living area .
a social area if you like .
in today's houses kitchens tend to be bigger .
when i read this crap i'm glad they didn't take me .
can i take the car tomorrow?
no .
did you drop something?
the glass from aunt trude .
shit .
you married a klutz .
do you want some red wine?
no .
that'll be julia .
so you decided ...
hi .
were you just going to bed?
come in .
this is jens .
this is my father .
could you take your shoes off?
hello .
that's katrin .
jens .
i've got something for you .
a letter from mum .
who's jens?
my boyfriend .
i bought your cheese .
you didn't say he was coming .
i said i was coming so i figured ...
ask first .
i didn't think you'd mind .
are we running a cheap hotel?
who will she bring along tomorrow?
so you're jens?
yes .
and what do you do?
that's my dessert .
the dessert stays here .
i said the dessert stays .
make yourself a sandwich .
well , have a nice evening , jens .
what is it?
stressing about the dessert .
jens .
we'll be seeing more of jens .
sleep well .
you too .
if you see a speed trap , call us .
0180242424 .
this is radio 24 .
nonstop power from the tower .
want to know what the stars have in store for you?
stay tuned to find out what this day hol ds .
coming up , the astral shower from the power tower .
with chris , of course .
it's 8 : 06 .
this is radio 24 .
good morning .
yuck , that is so gross .
what the hell is going on here?
we'll all go deaf soon at this rate .
holy cow !
are you losing it?
uwe !
is this an open air concert?
uwe , please come here .
uwe !
ellen , come here .
uwe , you come here .
ellen , come here , please .
please come here .
uwe , the raw meat in the bathtub .
what did i tell you?
it's gross .
notice anything?
anything different?
where's the bird?
hans peter !
mascha , oh god , mascha !
explain that to the kids .
hans peter !
hans peter !
hans peter !
maybe outside .
he's not in here .
oh god , no !
leave it open .
he might come back .
uwe !
be quiet .
i think i hear ...
where do we start?
i heard something here .
hans peter !
well , he's not here .
do they fly very far?
why did you leave the door open?
maybe he's on one of the balconies .
that was pretty stupid .
i had to air the flat .
so it's my fault .
it's always my fault .
it just gets so smoky .
i know , we need an extractor hood !
exactly !
it's been a problem for weeks .
now you blame me for airing .
well , that's just great !
why do i bother anyway?
shit .
i've got to go to work too .
i'm sorry .
let's have a look around the corner .
i don't have time now !
it'll take five minutes !
i've really got to go .
i have to take the meat back .
this is pointless .
where do you want to look?
birdbrain .
he should be easy to spot .
i mean , he's bright yellow .
ellen !
hans peter?
shit !
do you work here?
oh !
hi .
i'd like to buy something .
for yourself?
for my better half .
for katrin .
chris?
yes?
why did you get me this anyway?
no special reason .
i think i like it .
really?
the stuff cost enough !
listen , darling ...
could you hang my t shirt up so it doesn't get a crease across the chest?
yes .
when i was a little girl
i thought i'd be a pilot .
i wanted to fly planes .
i wanted to see different countries .
you say , " first finish your studies and there'll be plenty of time later .
then you end up on a truckstop because there isn't anything else .
and you kind of get stuck there .
it's all very strange .
but we're still young so it's not too late .
maybe chris will get an offer in ...
vienna .
that's a great city .
vienna is supposed to be nice .
yes .
hi , this is ellen .
could i speak to katrin , please?
oh , that's too bad .
that's too bad .
well ...
well , i still have some overtime .
so i can take time off .
we wanted to go to the pictures .
katrin and i.
oh well .
i can only manage today .
really?
i mean ...
have you got time?
really?
yes .
okay .
bye .
oh dear .
hear the bird?
hans peter .
what?
our budgie flew away .
do you feel guilty?
no , not really .
neither do i.
not in the slightest .
who would have thought?
me .
i'm serious .
since yesterday .
really?
you're joking , right?
me too .
yes !
hello , uwe !
katrin !
we're doing fine !
stop it !
have you gone mad?
he's gone absolutely mad !
now my dick's even smaller .
i want to go home !
the last time i was really happy?
that was when ellen told me that she was having a baby .
i think that was it .
that was really great .
we were both pleased .
it was on holiday .
we had time for each other .
time is pretty important .
it has a big influence on happiness .
you should take time for each other .
but we have to make ends meet .
we all have to make a living somehow .
because money is something you need to live these days .
that was terrific .
oh , here he comes .
evening .
hi .
so , what's the problem?
one of the lights is broken .
and now?
well ...
you drive me home .
we have to take the scooter .
it won't fit .
so it can go to the garage .
hi , martin .
bye .
bye .
i can put the vespa in the boot .
i've had much bigger things in there .
surely you can take me into work .
i told you that i can't tomorrow .
i have appointments and need the car .
your wife will have no way to get to work tomorrow .
want me to skip work?
no one's saying that .
i have a business trip tomorrow .
say i need a lift to my job .
just lift it a little higher .
just a bit higher .
what?
no .
it won't work .
fine , we'll try it the other way .
do you have to work in the sticks?
it's not funny .
higher , higher .
it'll fit .
another tight fit .
uwe?
i'm going to bed .
i'll join you soon .
sitting all the time exacerbates female problem areas .
bottom , thighs and waist .
many women suffer from tension .
they taste best .
the cream's so fresh .
i'll change my image to a fat redhead .
do you think red hair would suit me?
or darker .
like milva .
beautiful milva .
i bet chris wouldn't notice anything if i dyed my hair .
sure he would .
no .
come off it .
red hair?
he hasn't been very attentive recently .
it's like that when you've been together so long .
it's just the same with us .
not like it was when we first met .
perhaps we should ...
we should what?
start again from the beginning .
that's an idea .
you're back again .
well , screech owl .
brought a friend along?
don't stand there all day .
the stars are having a ball today .
taureans and scorpios particularly should now pay very close attention .
your astral diagram is on the ascendant .
two hundred zlotys .
okay .
can i book for just a few hours?
yes .
then it's half price .
chris?
you're a sly fox .
yes?
do you think so?
it was no coincidence .
what?
you know .
the horoscopes .
what horoscopes?
you've touched a thousand times .
sparks will fly the 1001 st time .
then we were together in the car .
under the bridge .
you will have a great adventure .
going over the border .
a new perspective .
that was today .
what's your star sign?
scorpio .
do you believe all that stuff?
yes , i do .
well , it's nice to have something to hold on to .
the whole world , and i'm not joking now .
the whole world has taken on a magical glow in your eyes .
your soul's current high is set to continue .
the hearts of the world , one especially , lie at your feet .
i'm back .
i got out early today .
there was some sort of accident .
we were sent home .
the truckstop was dead .
do you feel like going out somewhere?
chrissy?
chrissy , did you remember to ...
sorry .
are you crazy?
what's going on here?
have you gone mad?
katrin .
christian .
my clothes .
my clothes !
my shoes .
my shoes !
katrin , i'm sorry .
i should have told you .
keep your hands off me .
don't stop me .
let me out of here .
let me go .
let me go !
where are you going?
stay here .
what are you doing?
hi .
what do you want?
just thought i'd drop in .
how often have i said to call first?
i thought you'd be pleased .
you've picked a bad time .
that's not my fault .
oh , no .
are you back already?
stay where you are .
don't come into the kitchen .
close your eyes .
go on , close them .
hi .
keep your eyes shut .
keep them shut .
turn around .
keep them shut .
now .
open your eyes .
it even has a light .
i had to move the cupboard .
it was a bit too wide .
but i thought the cupboard could go over there .
what do you think?
very nice .
i deserve a drop too .
it's okay , isn't it?
well , it's great to see you so happy .
is something wrong?
i've fallen for someone .
what do you mean , fallen for someone?
i'm sorry .
you can't be serious .
who is it?
that's irrelevant .
it's extremely relevant to me .
who is it?
i want to know who he is .
are you completely off your rocker?
you come in here and say you've fallen for someone .
well .
it's obvious now .
logical really .
what an idiot .
of course you had to work late !
uwe .
uwe .
i always used to think relationships had to last a lifetime .
now i feel differently .
marriage is no marathon .
no endurance test .
and when you die you've crossed the finish line .
perhaps this constellation doesn't work .
what then?
perpetual variety?
it doesn't have to be perpetual .
it's different if you have children .
if a whole family is involved .
but i don't think you have to endure to the bitter end .
you could change partners every eight years .
that's no bad thing .
if your relationship is in a rut you get bogged down .
you don't gain much from it .
i used to think differently .
excuse me .
dring .
now?
at the office?
i'll be there in ten minutes .
i have to go .
uwe wants a man to man talk .
i'm going out .
uwe .
from the caf .
to loosen our tongues .
i'm glad you've come .
have a seat .
do you want to buy a ring?
18 carat gold .
you can have it for a fiver .
after 13 years of wedlock .
just like that .
i've fallen for someone .
man , i'm 40 now .
i can't start again at my age .
i'm 37 myself .
well .
it can happen to anyone .
she must be out of her mind .
crazy .
don't be so hard on ellen .
well , you're a great moral support , aren't you .
thanks a bunch .
you expect me to boost your esteem?
i thought you'd hit me .
it's not all ellen's fault .
of course not , but ...
well then .
katrin is furious with ellen .
what's katrin got to do with it?
she knows too .
she walked right in on us .
she caught us in the act .
i hadn't told her anything .
what a predicament .
ridiculous really .
damn it .
today really tops everything .
what an awful day .
no .
you're pulling my leg , aren't you?
just give us a call .
our number is 0180242424 .
it's 5 : 30 .
here's radio 24 .
megahits from the last 24 years .
from the 24th floor of the oder tower .
nonstop power from the power tower .
of course ...
shut your face !
central station .
geminis , your day won't be a bowl of cherries .
you are at odds with yourself .
feel misunderstood .
pick fights with your best friends .
anger and frustration are in the air .
your self confidence is at rock bottom .
your best option is to sleep in .
stay well away from alcohol .
16 .
16 minutes past 7 .
this is radio 24 with the magic hour .
good morning .
hi .
hello .
what are you doing here?
mum's working late .
she sent us .
she said she'd be home late from work .
she told us to come to you after school .
that's right .
i have my hands full .
she's crazy .
i don't believe this .
i have to organize my catering .
stupid cow .
sorry .
give us a kiss .
sit there .
i'll be over right away .
do you want some lunch?
egg and chips .
curry sausage .
shit !
sunshine , leave the kids alone .
i'm not doing anything .
just looking .
i'm not causing trouble .
you've already caused enough trouble .
no , you have to ...
i was just ...
stupid idiot !
i told you to stay away from the kids .
clumsy oaf !
get out of here !
get lost !
bastard .
no .
what a shame .
pick that up .
shake it off .
it happens .
it happens .
come on .
well .
look at it !
buy him a new book .
shit .
look at it .
he can redo it .
would you let your son hand that in?
do it again with him tonight .
i can't ...
who's making trouble?
bumble .
you could grab a towel .
get me a towel !
bumble .
just stay cool .
strong and silent .
why should i be?
everyone butting in .
i made a mistake .
so what?
strong and silent .
why are you poking me?
you always make mistakes .
it's getting on my nerves .
well .
this is all a bit strange , isn't it .
but still .
i felt it was high time we talked about this .
things can't stay as they are .
it's been going on a long time .
quite a while now .
gregor .
go and tell him , please .
please .
we had an agreement .
well , as i said .
we're all sensible adults here .
enough is enough .
the situation we find ourselves in at the moment can't continue .
we have two children .
we have a family .
we must sort this out somehow .
i don't know .
i'd like to hear your opinion .
yours , chris .
and yours , of course , ellen .
how do you want to proceed?
how do you plan to resolve this?
it's been going on a good while .
uwe , i don't really know what you're expecting to hear .
an answer .
i'm not promising anything .
i can't do that .
you're acting as if we were on trial .
but this isn't something we planned secretly over a long time .
it could as easily have been you .
hang on , chris .
i can understand if you slip up and go too far .
jump into bed together .
okay .
i can cope with that .
but if it happens regularly as it does at the minute
i can't stand for it .
certainly not from supposed friends .
what's the matter?
look , it's turned out really well .
that's cute .
mascha's a real artist .
lovely .
who is it?
no one in particular .
a lady .
but mum and dad have to discuss something important right now .
we'll have time later .
why don't you draw ...
katrin?
okay .
thanks a lot .
i won't stand for it .
i feel like i'm in kindergarten .
kindergarten?
who started this game , anyway?
it certainly wasn't me .
sure you don't want any cake?
no , thanks .
i'm not hungry .
here's the ashtray .
well , i think ...
okay .
listen , uwe .
i say you stop seeing each other .
that would be my suggestion .
i can't promise that .
i'm not interested in talking .
it won't achieve anything .
i can see that , pal .
i may as well go .
go then .
don't slam the door .
i can do as i like in my own home .
yes , of course .
if i want to slam the door , i will .
does anyone want more coffee?
no , thanks .
only a man could react like that .
a totally male reaction .
really , you have to ask yourself this .
what is a valid argument and what role does dented pride play?
yes .
a 90 % role , i'd say .
yes .
ever ask if i was happy?
give me compliments?
of course .
you criticized me from dawn to dusk .
now it's too late .
something's happened .
all at once you start playing the injured party .
i'm glad i don't have children .
bye .
i think ...
well , i'm suddenly ...
i see him in a new light .
i ...
now i find him very attractive again .
it sounds crazy .
but i can understand ellen .
i can imagine what attracts her .
and what she's discovered in him .
bye , gregor .
bye , mascha .
bye , love .
hello .
bye .
our paths were bound to cross at some point .
i'm sorry .
where are you going?
away somewhere .
please stay .
just for a moment .
i want to know why .
i want to know what i've done .
you can tell me that at least .
just say what i've done wrong .
i wish i could .
if it's my bad teeth , i'll go to the dentist .
if you want a new kitchen , i'll buy you one .
what the neighbours think is more important , is it?
you've done nothing wrong .
i don't understand you .
what's the problem?
what does he have that i don't?
uwe , i ...
don't touch me .
please .
please .
please .
you made a vow to me .
a pledge .
you solemnly declared , " till death us do part " .
quiet .
don't get sentimental .
let me go .
stop it .
no .
please .
don't leave me .
i won't let you go .
you won't get me back like this .
this is simply ridiculous .
if you leave now , don't bother coming back , stupid cow .
i understand what he says , i know .
but what can i do?
i can't change how i feel .
i can't help it .
you can't do anything .
the feeling is there .
i can't resist it .
i really did try .
at first i was so careful .
i didn't know where it would lead .
it kept going further , and ...
it's no longer just a flirt .
it's an opportunity for me .
dring .
hello .
here's the information , all the figures and a floor plan .
this is the kitchen .
big and spacious .
plenty of room for a table and chairs .
when did you want to move in?
as soon as possible .
let's look at the other apartment .
it's not ideal in my opinion .
living room .
that's stipulated?
you could use the other room as a living room if you so decide .
lovely corner bathtub .
great .
hang on .
is there a bath for grown ups?
stick your legs out .
this apartment's cosy .
all neat and compact .
it's a bit small .
just three rooms .
but the rent for this is lower than for the other .
you could make kitchen cabinets .
if you go to all that trouble you have to stay here permanently .
we don't quite agree on this yet .
we'll think about it .
don't make a snap decision .
sleep on it .
why all the fuss?
what's up?
you're too eager .
it's fine .
don't spoil things .
too tiny for four .
spare us your comments .
we'll improvise .
she wants a sale .
we must find something .
we'll come back later .
well .
we'll think about it .
you're exaggerating .
it's fine .
we'd burst at the seams .
what's all this about?
what are you playing at?
i'm speaking to you .
there's your stuff .
i don't want you in my room any more .
where can i go?
get set up in the spare room .
katrin , it's still our flat .
there's more .
here's the perfume .
i hope you had fun at my expense .
we didn't make fun of you at all .
help me with this , please .
i won't give you a hand .
i'll move your stuff , then .
stop this .
we're still married .
we're no longer married .
we're still married .
stop flitting back and forth to her .
our marriage isn't ruined yet .
we haven't divorced .
isn't ruined?
who destroyed everything we had?
i just need a bit of time , damn it .
all i need is a little time .
time .
is that so?
my fling with ellen may blow over .
i need time too .
but i can't promise .
you can't promise?
you made me different promises a few years ago .
what's the plan , anyway?
are you going to keep coming back home?
just leave and move in with her .
i need time .
go to her .
don't run back and forth .
i can't leave .
i need time .
don't you see?
wimp .
i need time .
yes , i'm a wimp .
you come home and pretend nothing's wrong .
and then you go back to her .
i have to adapt to the situation too .
calm down .
it's okay .
kiss me !
i have to pick up the goulash at 12 .
it's high time he came .
here he is .
at last .
sorry i'm late .
no doubt you've all heard the news .
there's been a serious accident on the autobahn .
it's a miracle that i'm standing before you .
i really owe my life to your local radio station .
to be precise , the horoscope feature with magic ...
magic piss .
in the horoscope for today he strongly recommended stopping to have a break .
i regard this as a sign from heaven .
i perceive it as confirmation of the success of our common project .
the stars are smiling on it .
we believe in frankfurt oder as an industrial centre .
time for the official ceremony .
mayor hartwig .
mr. kurzer .
would you mind doing the honours?
cut the first turf here .
this wasn't planned , but ...
this job is riddled with idiots .
i propose we cut the turf .
let's cut the first sod now .
if you both ...
he's back again .
you moron .
later .
and wipe that smile off your face .
we have to go , don't we?
too bad .
freezing cold today .
oh , not again .
listen to the wind out there .
hi , uwe .
what are you doing here , katrin , love?
what a nice surprise .
how are things?
what brings you to these climes?
lost your way?
laden with a rucksack , i see .
it's sealed .
i had to get out .
i couldn't just sit around .
why should i wait until his lordship deigns to come?
let's have some music .
that's good .
leave it on .
i like that .
for a change .
did he say he wanted to come home?
no , we weren't that clear .
last night i was hopeful .
i thought things were looking up .
but probably ...
i'm sick of them making a fool of me .
i've had enough .
but i have to say , it was quite an absurd situation .
i open the bathroom door and what do i see?
the two of them in the bath !
and i say sorry and go back out again .
honest .
i've been listening to that music for two weeks .
uwe , come on .
watch this .
can you do that?
you could join the circus .
ms. schrder would be impressed .
i can do it .
so can i.
katrin .
katrin , i'm sorry .
i have to talk to you .
i've made a mess of everything .
and then ...
if i could ...
who's that?
chris?
what's going on?
katrin said we could stay here and do what we like .
turn the light off , please .
katrin said that?
yes .
where is she?
i don't know .
please turn the light off .
that doesn't mean you can ...
very funny .
now they've invaded our bedroom .
a black hole of a day for you too .
a nasty lunar eclipse mars the night .
venus is in reverse .
no cuddles today .
the day is pitch black .
everything is futile .
the sun and pluto are at loggerheads .
all in all a day to forget .
expect no improvement .
later your energy cycle will slump to nothing .
someone's birthday?
it's for you .
for me?
from some car dealer .
it might lift your spirits .

what's wrong with you?
i hate this ceiling .
this is the seventh .
you don't want to move in with me .
i don't want to crawl everywhere .
let's go back down .
we're going downstairs .
no problem .
it's not my cup of tea .
what's wrong with you?
nothing .
you're looking at me strangely .
i have a funny feeling .
i'm sorry .
sorry for what?
bye .
