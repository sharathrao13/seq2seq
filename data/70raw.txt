we got a 1000 knot closure , mav .
he's coming right at us .
okay , buddy .

mustang , this is ghostrider 117 , this bogey's all over me .
he's got missile lock on me , do i have permission to fire?
do not fire until fired upon .
goose , there they are .
right below us .
the mig's in perfect firing position .
and he's right on cougar's tale .
no way , goose .
he would have fired by now .
he's just trying to piss us off .
maverick , get down here and get this asshole off me !
easy , cougar .
bring him back , hard right .
help me engage .
i'm on my way .
i can't shoot this son of a bitch .
let's see if we can have a little fun with him .
is this your idea of fun , mav?
greetings .
watch the birdie .
geez , i crack myself up .
this is a great shot , mav .
i should be a photographer .
cougar , your tail is clear .
mig one has bugged out .
cougar , this is maverick .
we've had enough fun for one day , don't you think?
i'm getting a lil 'low on fuel , so we're heading home .
we'll see you on deck .
cougar , we're running low on gas , we gotta get outta here .
cougar?
we're on vapour , cougar .
let's do it .
cougar , come on , cougar !
let's take it back to the ship , man .
come on , cougar .
get him on deck as soon as possible , he's gotta be low on fuel .
cougar , we've got to land this thing .
we are way low on gas you understand me?
are you all right , man?
maverick , you're 3/ 4 to fall out , call the ball .
roger .
maverick has the ball .
goose , cougar's in trouble .
come on , mav , we're getting low on gas , let's land this sucker .
cougar !
goddamn it , maverick !
what're you doing , mav?
we've got no fuel for this .
we're going after cougar .
you tell him to land that plane .
that's an order !
ghostrider , you're instructed to land .
land immediately .
any of you boys seen an aircraft carrier around here?
man , we got a lil 'problem up here , that mig really screwed him up .
i don't think he can make it back .
you're okay , cougar .
just stay on my wing .
i'll take you all the way in .
just stay with me .
easy , cougar .
just a walk in the park , buddy .
you're a little low .
you're a little low , coug .
come on , buddy , pull up .
pull up , cougar .
that's it .
almost there .
a little below glide path .
3/ 4 over now , call the ball .
rogerball .
you're too low .
you're too low , cougar !
more power !
come in .
cougar , you should be in a sickbed , what's on your mind?
my wife and kid , sir .
i almost orphaned him today . , and i've never even seen him .
i don't know what happened up there , but i was so scared .
come on , we've seen this before .
no , sir .
i'm holding on too tight .
i've lost the edge .
i'm sorry , sir .
i'm sorry .
cougar?
thanks , maverick .
maverick , goose , come in here .
what the hell's going on?
i don't know .
shit .
maverick , you just did an incredibly brave thing .
what you should have done was land your plane .
you don't own that plane , the taxpayers do !
son , your ego's writing cheques your body can't cash .
you've been busted , you've lost your qualifications as section leader three times .
put in hack twice by me with a history of high speed passes ... ... over five air control towers and one admiral's daughter !
penny benjamin?
you , asshole , you're lucky to be here .
thank you , sir .
and let's not bullshit , maverick .
your family name ain't the best in the navy .
you need to be doing it better and cleaner than the other guy , now what is it with you?
just want to serve my country , be the best fighter pilot in the navy , sir .
don't screw around with me , maverick .
you're a hell of an instinctive pilot .
maybe too good .
i'd like to bust your butt , but i can't ... ... i got another problem here .
i gotta send somebody from this squadron to miramar .
i gotta do something .
i still can't believe it .
i gotta give you your dream shot .
i'm gonna send you up against the best .
you two characters are going to top gun .
for five weeks you're going to fly against the best pilots in the world .
you were number two .
cougar was number one .
cougar lost it , turned in his wings .
you guys are number one .
you screw up just this much , you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of hong kong .
yes , sir !
that is all .
tell me about the mig some other time .
gentlemen?
good luck , gentlemen .
thank you , sir .
thank you .
during korea , the navy kill ratio was 12 to 1 .
we shot down 12 of their jets for every one of ours .
during vietnam , that ratio fell to 3 to 1 .
our pilots become dependant upon missiles .
they lost some of their dog fighting skills .
now , top gun was created to teach acm " air combat manoeuvring " .
dog fighting .
this gives me a hard on .
by the end of vietnam , that ratio was back to 12 to 1 .
don't tease me .
blinds , please .
i'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our commanding officer at top gun . ... very first man to win the top gun trophy .
you will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world .
commander mike metcalf .
call sign , viper .
gentlemen ...
you're the top one percent of all naval aviators .
the elite .
the best of the best .
we'll make you better .
you fly at least two combat missions a day , attend classes inbetween , and evaluations of your performance .
on each combat sequence you're gonna meet a different challenge .
every encounter is gonna be much more difficult .
we're gonna teach you to fly the f 14 right to the edge of the envelope , faster than you've ever flown before .
and more dangerous .
now , we don't make policy here , gentlemen .
elected officials , civilians , do that .
we are the instruments of that policy , and although we are not at war , we must always act as though we are at war .
what are you doing?
just wondering who's the best .
in case some of you wonder who the best is , they're here on this plaque on the wall .
the best driver and his rlo from each class has his name on it .
and they have the option to come back here to be top gun instructors .
you think your name's gonna be on that plaque?
yes , sir .
that's pretty arrogant , considering the company you're in .
yes , sir .
i like that in a pilot .
remember , when it's over out there , we're all on the same team .
gentlemen , this school is about combat .
there are no points for second place .
dismissed .
nice going .
the plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies 'room .
oh , jesus ...
you kill me .
you really do .
no , no , no .
there's two o's in goose , boys .
this is what i call a target rich environment .
you live your life between your legs , mav .
goose , even you could get laid in a place like this .
i'd be happy to find a girl who'd talk dirty to me .
mav , you wanted to know who the best is?
that's him .
iceman .
that's the way he flies .
ice cold .
no mistakes .
just wears you down .
you get bored , frustrated , you do something stupid , and he's got you .
hey , hey , slider .
i thought you wanted to be a pilot , man .
what happened?
goose , you're suck a dickhead .
whose butt did you kiss to get here?
the list is long but distinguished .
yeah , so is my johnson .
so you're flying with lceman , huh .
it's mr. iceman for you .
hey , mother goose , how's it going?
doing good .
tom , this is pete mitchell .
tom kazansky .
congratulations on top gun .
thank you .
sorry to hear about cougar ... ... you know , we were like brothers in fight school .
he was a good man .
still is a good man .
yeah , that's what i meant .
thought so .
so , you need any help?
with what?
you figured it out yet?
what's that?
who's the best pilot .
no , i think i can figure that one out on my own .
i heard that about you .
you like to work alone .
mav , you must've your soul under a lucky star , huh .
i mean , first the mig and then you slide into cougar's spot ...
we didn't slide into cougar's spot , it was ours , ok .
yeah well , some pilots wait a whole career to see a mig up close .
guess you guys are lucky and famous , huh .
no , you mean notorious .
i'll see you later .
you can count on it .
they were abused children .
we're gonna have a good time .
always .
okay , i guess it's my turn , isn't it?
all right , the bet is 20 dollars .
you have to have carnal knowledge , of a lady this time , on the premises .
on the premises .
come on , mav ... a bet's a bet .
i don't know , it just doesn't seem fair ... for you , i mean .
but uh ...
she's lost that loving feeling .
she's los ...
no , she hasn't .
yes , she has .
she has not lost that lo ...
goose , she's lost it , man .
come on .
i hate it when she does that .
excuse me , miss .
hey , hey , hey .
don't worry .
i'll take care of this .
you never close your eyes anymore when i kiss your lips ... ... there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips ...
you're trying hard not to show it , baby ... ... but baby , believe me , i know that ...
you lost that loving feeling , oh , that loving feeling .
you lost that loving feeling , now it's gone , gone , gone ...
sit down .
thank you .
i love that song .
i've never seen that approach .
how long have you two been doing this act?
i don't know .
since uh ...
puberty?
right , puberty .
i'm charlotte blackwood .
i'm maverick .
" maverick "?
did your mother not like you or something?
no , it's my call sign .
you're a pilot !
that's right .
a naval aviator .
actually , we've only done this twice .
oh , how'd you do?
crashed and burned on the first one , it wasn't pretty .
and the second?
i don't know , i'll tell you tomorrow .
but it's looking good so far .
well , " maverick " ... my friend just arrived , so it's been great talking to you .
perry !
hi .
hi .
here you go .
i'll be with you in just a second , ok .
listen , can i ask you a personal question?
that depends .
are you a good pilot?
i can hold my own .
great .
then i won't have to worry about you making your living as a singer .
i'm gonna need a beer to put these flames out .
great , mav .
real slick .
a long cruise , was it , sailor?
too long .
what you wanna do , just drop by down on the tile and go for it?
i actually had this counter in mind .
that would be very , very comfortable , yeah .
it could be .
actually , i came in here to save you from making a big mistake with that older guy .
really?
so i could go on to a bigger one with a young guy like yourself?
maybe .
i have to get up early in the morning .
what are you doing?
your friend was magnificent .
you'll also be trained and evaluated by civilian specialists .
the civilians are hre because they are our very best source of information on enemy aircraft .
one of the most qualified is our call sign charlie .
she has a ph. d. in astrophysics .
and she's also a civilian contract , so you do not salute her .
but you better listen to her , because the pentagon listens to her about your proficiency .
all yours , charlie .
hello .
we will be dealing with f 5s and a 4s as our mig simulators .
now , then , as most of you know , the f 5 doesn't have the thrust to weight ratio of the mig 28 .
and it doesn't bleed energy below 300 knots like the mig 28 .
however , the mig 28 does have a problem with its inverted flight tanks .
it won't do a negative g push over .
the latest intelligence tells us the most it will do is 1 negative ...
excuse me , lieutenant .
is there something wrong?
yes , ma'am .
the data on the mig is inaccurate .
how's that , lieutenant?
well , i just happened to see a mig 28 ...
we , we .
sorry , goose .
we happened to see a mig 28 do a 4 g negative dive .
where did you see this?
that's classified .
it's what?
it's classified .
i could tell you , but then i'd have to kill you .
lieutenant , i have top secret clearance .
the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you .
well , ma'am , it doesn't seem so in this case now , does it? .
so , lieutenant ... where exactly were you?
well , we started up on his six when he pulled through the clouds .
i went above him .
if you were directly above him , how could you see him?
because i was inverted .
bullshit .
no , he was , man .
it was a really great move .
he was inverted .
you were in a 4 g inverted dive with a mig 28?
yes , ma'am .
at what range?
about two metres?
well , it was actually about 1/ 2 , i think .
i have a great polaroid of it .
it was a nice picture .
lieutenant?
what were you doing there?
communicating .
communicating .
keeping up foreign relations .
i was , you know , giving him the bird .
you know , the finger .
i know the finger , goose .
i'm sorry , i hate it when it does that .
i'm sorry .
excuse me .
so you're the one?
yes , ma'am .
all right , we have a hop to take .
the hard deck on this hop will be 10, 000 feet .
there'll be no engagement below that .
move it !
lieutenant !
okay , don't be late again .
you look great , honey .
lieutenant , why didn't you tell me you were the famous mig lnsulter?
would it have made any difference?
not in the ladies 'room , no .
and what would've?
i'm an instructor at this school , i see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks .
now , i'm sure you can figure that out .
look , lieutenant .
i'd just really like to hear about the mig sometime .
you've got security clearance .
you read about it .
maverick ...
i'm curious .
who was covering cougar while you were showboating with this mig?
cougar was doing just fine .
gentlemen , this is your first hop .
the jets you're flying against are smaller and faster and more manoeuvreable .
just like the enemy migs .
clock is ticking , and as of now we are keeping score .
i lost him , goose .
show me what you've got , kid .
i lost him .
i'm looking .
i'm looking .
i got him , i got him .
he's on our tail , coming hard .
i got him .
here we go .
alright , talk to me , goose .
he's still back there .
he's closing in on us .
he's closing fast .
you can run , kid , but you can't hide .
all right , jester , i'll give you a run for your money here .
watch the mountains !
i still got 'im , he's still back there .
come on , mav , do some of that pilot shit .
yeah .
i got 'im .
come on , bring it right .
i've had about enough of this shit .
when i hit the brakes , he'll fly right by .
you're mine .
jesus christ !
let's see what you've got now , jester .
ok , man .
let's turn and burn .
he's going vertical .
so am l .
we're going ballistic , man .
go get him !
he's going for the hard deck .
let's get down there first and nail him , mav .
no way , jester .
you're mine .
i've got you now !
jester's dead .
jester's dead .
get your butts above the hard deck and return to base .
yes , sir !
tower , this is ghost rider requesting a fly by .
negative , ghost rider .
the pattern is full .
no , no , mav .
this is not a good idea .
sorry , goose ... but it's time to buzz the tower .
goddamn son of a bitch !
great balls of fire .
jester's dead .
you won?
bullshit .
didn't everybody? .
no , man .
we got our butts kicked .
30 seconds .
we went like this , he went like that ... ... i said to hollywood , " where did he go?
hollywood said , " where did who go?
and he's laughing at us right on the radio , he's laughing at us .
that was me laughing , dickhead .
we won .
all right !
they won too , man .
that's not what i heard .
no , we did .
we got jester .
below the hard deck doesn't count .
hard deck my ass , we nailed that son of a bitch .
you guys really are cowboys .
what's your problem , kazansky?
you're everyone's problem .
that's because every time you go up in the air , you're unsafe .
i don't like you because you're dangerous .
that's right , lceman .
i am dangerous .
maverick .
you and goose get your butts outta that flight gear and up to viper's office , now !
remember boys , no points for second place .
you're a lot brighter than you look .
you shut up .
don't worry , don't worry .
two of your snot nosed jockeys did a fly by at my tower at over 400 knots .
i want somebody's butt , i want it now , i've had it .
goddamn it , that's twice .
i want some butts !
well , that'll just about cover the fly bys .
follow me .
gentlemen .
you had a hell of a first day .
the hard deck for this hop was 10, 000 feet .
you knew it .
you broke it .
you followed commander heatherly below after he lost sight of you .
why?
sir , i had commander heatherly in my sights .
he saw me move in for the kill ... ... he then proceeded below the hard deck .
we weren't below 10, 000 for more than a few seconds .
i had the shot .
there was no danger , so i took it .
you took it , and broke a major rule of engagement .
then you broke another one with that circus stunt fly by .
lieutenant mitchell , top gun rules of engagement exist for your safety and for that of your team .
they're not flexible , nor am l .
either obey them or you are history .
is that clear?
yes , sir !
dismissed .
i really enjoyed that , mav , thanks a lot .
holy shit .
maybe i could learn how to be a truck driver .
mav , you got the number of that truck driving school that was on tv , truck master , something like this?
i might need that .
state in those reports says it all .
he's a wild card .
completely unpredictable .
he got you , didn't he?
yeah .
maverick .
i flew with his old man .
tell me one thing ... if you had to go into battle , would you want him with you?
i don't know .
i just don't know .
still awake?
yeah .
what's up?
can't sleep .
you kow , when i realised we were going to top gun , all i could think about was getting that trophy .
i've got to be straight with you , mav .
right now , i just hope we graduate .
i got a family to think about .
i can't afford to blow this .
i guess that fly by wasn't such a big hit , huh?
look , man , i know it's tough for you .
the academy rejected you because you're duke mitchell's kid .
you have to live with that reputation .
but it's like everytime we go up there , it's like you're flying against a ghost .
it makes me nervous .
you're the only family i've got .
i'm not gonna let you down .
i promise .
get out of here .
a rolling reversal would work well in that situation .
if i reversed on a hard cross , i could immediately go to guns on him .
but at that speed , it's too fast .
it's a little bit too aggressive .
too aggressive?
yeah , i guess when i see something , i go right after it .
you didn't tell me who you were the other night .
you didn't give me a chance , did you?
you deserved it .
i know ... but uh ... you were tempted ... to ask me out for dinner .
no .
no?
no .
i don't date students .
i can see it's dangerous for you .
but if the government trusts me ... ... maybe you could .
it takes a lot more than just fancy flying .
crash and burn , huh , mav? .
slider ...
you stink .
let's go !
come on , mav .
just one more game .
that evens it up .
i got some things to take care of .
" take care of "?
just one more game .
please?
for me?
i'm sorry .
you're sorry ...
come on ...
for me?
damn it .
lieutenant?
what?
no singing?
look , i'm ...
no apologies .
if you don't mind , i'm ...
i'm just gonna take a quick shower while you're finishing up here .
yeah , i do mind .
i'm hungry .
and then i thought about it .
i thought , " you know , he's a smart guy .
why don't you just tell him why you've got him here?
it's the mig .
the mig .
you're the only pilot who's been up against a mig 28 .
i'm trying for this big promotion .
if i get it , i won't be here much longer .
seems to me you've got it all figured out .
except you did forget the wine .
sorry .
you always get what you want?
no , not always .
yeah , maybe .
then relax about the mig .
this music ...
an old friend?
my folks loved it .
i haven't heard this in years .
my mother used to call from her room and have me play this over and over again ... ... i got so sick of it .
but not her .
she'd sit up there alone , just listening for hours .
just listening .
she died shortly after him .
what happened to your father?
i guess i kinda figured with your security clearance you'd know more about it than i do .
well , i didn't get that far .
well , that's a big mystery .
he disappeared in an f 4 , november 5th , 1965 .
the stink of it was ... he screwed up .
no way .
my old man was a great fighter pilot .
but who the hell knows?
it's all classified .
somebody must know .
yeah , somebody knows everything .
is that why you're always second best up there?
you are direct , aren't you .
i'm sorry i was late .
i'm sorry for being direct .
no apologies .
this is going to be complicated .
where are you going?
i'm gonna take a shower .
thank you .
i enjoyed being here .
it looks like you need another shower .
right .
i'm gonna be honest with you .
your mig sighting is really important to my work , but uh ...
i don't normally invite students to my house .
you're uh ...
but please understand , i still have a job to do .
i'm glad we got that straight .
i told her how tough it is here .
you know , my ass dragging like an old tired dog .
i told her you didn't even have a woman here .
she said , " oh , he probably doesn't have 1 , he's got 8 .
hi !
daddy .
so , maverick !
goose tells me you're in love with one of your instructors .
is that right?
i didn't tell her that .
i can't believe you said that .
that was a secret .
the bogey has good position right here .
freeze frame .
a moment of choice .
the f 14 is defensive .
he has a chance to bug out right here .
better to retire and save your aircraft than push a bad position .
charlie , jump in here any time .
now , you stay in that diamond another three seconds ... ... the bogey's gonna blow you out in the sky .
you take a hard right , select zone five ... ... you can extend an escape .
you made a bad choice .
charlie?
aircraft one performs a split s?
that's the last thing you should do .
the mig's right on your tail .
freeze there , please .
the mig has you in his gunsight .
what were you thinking at this point?
you don't have time to think up there .
if you think , you're dead .
that's a big gamble with a $30 million dollar plane , lieutenant .
unfortunately , the gamble worked .
the mig never got a clean shot .
maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here , comes over the top , and he defeats the bandit with a missile shot .
the encounter was a victory , but i think we have show it as an example of what not to do .
next .
gutsiest move i ever saw , man .
now then , this is a perfect example of a textbook manoeuvre .
lieutenant?
my review of your performance was right on , in my professional opinion .
i can't hear you .
jesus christ !
and you think i 'm reckless !
when i fly , my crew and my plane come first .
well , i'm gonna finish my sentence , lieutenant .
my review of your flight performance was right on .
is that right?
that is right .
but i held something back .
i see some real genius in your flying , maverick , but i can't say that in there .
i was afraid that everyone in that tacts training would see right through me .
i just don't want anyone to know that i've fallen for you .
hey , maverick?
you hear about lce?
what's that?
he won another one .
really?
yeah .
i fell the need ... ... the need for speed .
gentlemen , this is hop 19 .
multiple aircraft , multiple bogeys .
your training is half over .
the competltion for the top gun trophy remains tight .
first place , lceman .
second place , maverick .
just two points behind .
there they are .
three miles , left , 10 o'clock .
i don't think they see us yet .
ok , i see them .
two a 4s .
left 10 o'clock level .

bingo , maverick's dead .
you're out of there , kid .
the defence department regrets to inform you your sons are dead because they were stupid .
great balls of fire .
knock it off , gentlemen .
let's go home .
viper has the lead .
30 seconds , wolfman .
i'm coming in .
shut up !
that was some of the best flying i've seen yet .
right up to the part where you got killed .
you never , never leave your wingman .
maverick ...
it's not your flying , it's your attitude .
the enemy's dangerous , but right now you're worse than the enemy .
you're dangerous and foolish .
you may not like who's flying with you , they may not like you ... but whose side are you on?
at least viper got lceman before he got us .
we've still got a shot at it .
that was stupid , i know better than that .
that will never happen again .
i know ...
i know .
maverick , would you go fetch him .
doesn't he ever embarrass you?
goose? , hell no .
well , there was the time ...
admiral's daughter .
what? !
he told me all about the time you went ballistic with penny benjamin .
did he?
that's great ...
he tells me about all of them .
how my lil 'angel goose goes home early for church ...
... and you !
you always go home with the hot women .
alright .
thank you , carole .
i'm gonna go embarrass myself with goose for a while .
i'd love to be able to warn you off about maverick , but i just love him to death .
i've known pete for a lot of years now and ...
i'm telling you , one thing's for certain .
there are hearts breaking wide open all over the world tonight .
why?
because , unless you are a fool , that boy is off the market .
he is 100 % prime time in love with you .
hey , goose , you big stud .
that's me , honey .
take me to bed or lose me forever .
show me the way home , honey .
come on , brother , sing with the family .
maverick , you big stud ...
take me to bed or lose me forever .
okay , gentlemen , this is hop 31 .
two weeks to graduation .
the top gun trophy is still up for grabs , so every point counts .
well , it's bottom of the night , the score is tied .
it's time for the big one .
you up for this one , maverick?
just a walk in the park , cazansky .
contact .
multiple bogeys , 165 .
two miles .
looks like they're going away from us .
oh , i see 'em .
right , two o'clock .
i'm in .
i'm in .
that son of a bitch cut me off .
come on .
jesus christ , lce , take the shot .
come on , ice .
get the hell out of there .
i can't get the angle .
i'm too close for missiles .
i'm switching to guns .
ice , fire or clear !
look at this !
jesus christ , i can take a shot right here .
i need another 20 seconds and i've got him .
i'm moving in .
i've got the shot .
come on , mav , let's get in there .
come on , mav !
maverick's getting impatient .
now , come on , take the shot .
10 more seconds , then i've got 'im .
come on , get the hell out of there .
let's do it , mav .
ice , come off my right .
i'm in .
five more seconds .
come off my right .
i'm in .
i'm off .
shit .
we're in a jetwash .
shit !
this is not good .
shit , we've got a flame out , mav .
engine one is out ...
engine two is out .
i'm losing control .
i can't control it !
it's coupling up .
this is not good !
mayday , mayday .
mav's in trouble .
he's in a flat spin heading out to sea !
altitude 8, 000 ... 7, 000 ...
we're at 6, 000 !
i can't reach the ejection handle !
you're gonna have to punch us out .
i can't reach the ejection handle !
eject ...
watch the canopy !
goose ...
oh , no !
oh , god .
sir , let go of him .
you've got to let him go , sir .
how are you doing?
i'm all right .
goose is dead .
i know .
you fly jets long enough , something like this happens .
he was my rlo , my responsibility .
in my squadron in vietnam , we lost 8 of 18 aircraft .
10 men .
the first one dies , you die too .
but there will be others .
you can count on it .
you've got to let him go .
you've got to let him go .
i think maybe it was my fault .
i don't know .
i don't know what the hell went wrong .
i'd like to help .
i know it's difficult .
god , i want him back .
i'll be here if you need me , okay?
god , he loved flying with you , maverick .
he would have flown anyway ... without you .
he'd've hated it , but he would have done it .
we find that the f 14 flatspin was induced by the disruption of air flow into the starboard engine .
this disruption stalled the engine ... ... which produced enough yaw rate to induce a spin ... ... which was unrecoverable .
there was no way lieutenant mitchell could see or avoid the jetwash which produced the engine stall .
therefore , the board of lnquiry finds lieutenant mitchell was not at fault in the accident of 29th of july .
lieutenant mitchell's record will be cleared of this incident .
lieutenant mitchell's restored to flight status without further delay .
these proceedings are closed .
get him up flying , soon .
come on , kid , come on .
get in there .
engage .
alright , you've got a bogey at two o'clock low , maverick .
you got the angle , piece of cake now .
take the shot , kid .
take the shot .
you can engage any time , maverick .
hey !
where the hell are you going?
it's not good .
it doesn't look good .
what do you mean , " it doesn't look good "?
it doesn't get to look any better than that .
hey , man .
we coulda had him ...
hey !
we coulda had him , man !
i'll fire when i'm goddamn good and ready .
you got that?
he can't get back in the saddle , he won't engage .
it's only been a few days .
you know , he just might not make it back .
keep sending him up .
mitchell?
i'm sorry about goose .
everybody liked him .
i'm sorry .
hi , it's wolfman .
maverick just quit .
excuse me ...
may l?
please .
i'll have what he's having .
hemlock , is it?
ice water .
you weren't gonna say goodbye?
i heard you got that job in washington .
congratulations .
thanks .
but i wasn't gonna leave without saying goodbye .
it's good to see you .
thanks .
where are you going?
you don't even have a ticket , do you?
listen , i've seen all the evidence , and it's not your responsibility .
it's not your fault .
you're one of the best pilots in the navy .
what you do up there ...
it's dangerous .
but you've got to go on .
you don't understand .
when i first met you , you were larger than life .
look at you .
you're not gonna be happy unless you're going mach 2 with your hair on fire , you know that .
no , that's over .
it's just over .
to be the best of the best means you make mistakes and then you go on , it's just like the rest of us .
you don't think i know that?
i'm here to help .
look , thank you .
but if i'd wanted help , really ...
i would have asked for it .
so , i'm too late .
you've already left .
you didn't learn a damn thing , did you?
except to quit .
you've got that manoeuvre down real well .
so long , pete mitchell .
oh , hi , maverick , come on in .
how are you doing?
good yeah?
sure you're feeling okay?
fine .
great .
jamie , come on .
can i get you a drink or anything else like that?
no , thank you .
ok , why don't you just uh ...
thank you very much .
make yourself comfortable , 'cuz mike will be right down , ok?
ok .
thank you .
i flew with your old man .
vf 51 , the oriskany .
you're a lot like he was .
only better ... ... and worse .
he was a natural heroic son of a bitch , that man .
so he did do it right .
yeah , he did it right .
is that why you fly the way you do?
trying to prove something?
yeah , your old man did it right .
what i'm about to tell you is classified .
it could end my career .
we were in the worst dogfight ever dreamed of .
there were ... bogeys like fireflies all over the sky .
his f 4 was hit , he was wounded , but he could have made it back .
he stayed in it ... ... saved three planes before he bought it .
how come i never heard that before?
the battle occurred over the wrong line on some map .
so you were there?
i was there .
what's on your mind?
my options , sir .
simple .
first , you've acquired enough points ... ... to show up tomorrow and graduate with your top gun class .
or you could quit .
there'll be no disgrace .
that spin was hell , it would have shook me up .
so you think i should quit?
i didn't say that .
the simple fact is , you feel responsible for goose .
and you have a confidence problem .
i'm not gonna sit here and blow sunshine up your ass , lieutenant .
a good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what's happened ... ... so he can apply what he's learned .
up there , we've got to push it .
that's our job .
it's your option , lieutenant .
all yours .
sorry to bother you on a sunday , sir , but thank you very much for your time .
no problem .
good luck .
gentlemen ...
where's maverick? .
i don't know where he is .
you know what he's planning to do?
it's got to be hard on the guy , though , you know .
congratulations .
thank you .
congratulations .
thanks , mav .
sir .
gentlemen , i hate to break up the party before it really gets out of hand ...
some of you have to depart immediately .
we have a crisis situation .
ice , slider ...
yo .
hollywood , wolfman .
yes , sir .
maverick .
sir .
maverick , you'll get your rlo when you get to the ship .
and if you don't ... ... give me a call .
i'll fly with you .
gentlemen , this is bull's eye .
the communication ship ss layton has become disabled and has wandered into foreign territory .
a rescue operation is to begin within the hour .
your mission is to give air support to that rescue .
there are migs in the area , and tensions are high .
if you witness a hostile act , you will return fire .
those mlgs carry the exocet anti ship missile .
they can fire that missile from a 100 miles away .
gentlemen , this is the real thing .
this is what you've been trained for .
you are america's best .
make us proud .
ice ...
hollywood , sector two .
maverick , you back them up with merlin on ready five .
yes , sir .
rise .
excuse me , sir .
this is not personal .
but with regard to maverick ... is he the best pilot to ..?
