please , wait another month .
i beg you .
stop kidding us !
we are no boy scouts !
i can't give you something i don't have .
it's not my fault .
you could sell some land , or some of your machinery .
there are endless possibilities of getting into money .
everything is already given in mortgage .
then you'll have to sell your body , right?
your heart ... your liver ... your eyes ...
if you start threatening me , i'll go to the police !
you can't be a yakuza if you're afraid of the police !
do you want me to rip your eyes out? !
brother !
shut up , brother !
kobayashi ...
kobayashi ...
hey !
i'm gonna kill you !!
i'm gonna kill you , and then i'll die !!
wait !
freeze !
i'm gonna kill you !!
and then i'll die , too !
hey !
hey !!
we're sorry .
there's nothing worse than a yakuza being fooled by an underdog .
exactly how long have you been working for us now?
please let us try again , then we'll certainly ... junji .
do you really think that you'll bring home the bacon the next time?
forget about him , i want you to be honest !
will hagane be able to collect the debt?
i don't think so .
you idiot !
even your little brother doesn't put it past you !
matsuba !
yes?
work with junji .
if he's going on working with hagane , he'll be wrecked .
okay .
hey , hagane !
yes?
go und scrub the john .
hey , naomi !
i've been waiting for you !
you need money , right?
don't talk like that !
50 . 000 yen .
okay , 30 . 000 ...
no , i just need 10 . 000 .
soon i'll be very rich and i'll take care for you !
okay?
i'm sorry .
i'm all knocked out ...
your dick is too small .
and you can't even get it up ...
shut up !
ouch ... !
what was that for? !
you must be completely crazy !
i'm not afraid of you !
you can't even fuck me properly !
so don't act the big shot , do you hear me? !
don't try something like that again , asshole !
it's cold !
what the fuck ...? !
what's up?
what's the big idea , you idiot? !
sorry .
i'm really sorry .
you're sorry?
are you trying to kid me?
go !
get up !
hey !
do you know who i am?
i'm a yakuza .
do you want to pick a fight with a yakuza?
you should go .
what did you say , you idiot? !
hey , yakuza !
hey !
please , give it back ... !
shut up !
what's in it?
no bills !
really?
fuck !
let's go !
bye !
idiot !
i found it !
brother !
what are you doing?
i lost my wallet .
brother matsuba is looking for you .
why?
tosa will be released from prison tomorrow morning .
boss .
chairman yokoi has arrived .
oh yeah ...
you're making me come to a place like that?
yomo .
what do you want from me?
the man ... who cut off your right arm will be released from prison tomorrow .
what do you think about the rumor?
rumor?
yeah .
the boss is going to retire and wants to tap neither yomo or tosa ... as his successor .
no idea .
yomo is the legitimate successor .
but for the boss , tosa's just like his very own son .
furhermore , he saved our group ...
this is a really old hat !
the nakame goup is subordinated to the musashi group .
at that time , it is impossible that the groups start an internal fight .
our new boss can't be just the one who finished off ... the boss of the nakame group .
you can't seriously believe that !
kei .
take good care of yourself .
brother maeda has it in for you .
taka .
i know that , as a yakuza , i'm a total failure .
but i'm sure that things would change if tosa was my boss .
i really believe that .
tosa ... !
we're relieved to see that you're doing well .
i'm sorry .
the boss has an important meeting , that's why he couldn't be here .
how is his heart?
not that good .
the doctor says a another collapse would be perilous .
i see .
he's staying at the hakone hospital and he's expecting your visit .
his rehab will go on until midday .
you shoud take a rest .
you have plenty of time to take a nice relaxing bath .
i rent a house for you at close quarters .
do i stop here?
no .
drive on .
yes .
hello?
hello , boss !
take brother tosa in .
yeah , i'm sorry .
hello?
yeah , yeah , i know .
i know .
yes !
yes .
i remember you .
at that time , you were a trainee ...
yes .
i still have it ...
out of the way !
it is ... so big ... !
you're that yakuza guy ...
look at you !
no more violence !
apologize for that !
ouch !
hey !
let's go !
you bastard !!
hey ...
what do you think of my dick?
who's got the bigger dick , me or brother hagane ...?
look at it .
take a close look ...
look at the two pearls ...
yeah , i see them ...
that's so awesome ...
brother hagane is dead ...
who cares?
come on , show me your pussy ...
apparently you woke up .
don't worry !
i'll fix you , and then you will be able to move again .
okay?
you're not perfected !
you can't go out just like that , you're still not waterproof !
if your heart gets a short right now , you're dead .
do you want to say something?
what's going on here? !
come on , relax !
who are you?
my name is genpaku hiraga .
i'm an ingenious chemist .
well , some people call me an otaku ... some even say that i'm some kind of " nutty professor " ...
i don't care !
i just want to know why i'm here !
you don't remember anything?
maybe the correlative circuit hasn't been closed yet ...
do you remember now?
you and another man were killed .
i revived you .
creating the perfect human was my childhood dream .
and so i found myself a body to make my dream come true .
body ...?
yeah .
you can get one amazingly easy on the black market .
there are a lot of people no one's missing .
and there's always somebody who just wants to get rid of some corpses ...
corpses like you .
three months ago , i paid 2 . 000 . 000 yen for the two of you .
who?
well ...
i just went to an arranged place to pick up the bodies .
somebody told me over the phone where to transfer the money .
i don't know who .
these were the rules !
you were in a really poor condition and had lots of bullet holes .
but miraculously ... the other man's heart and your brain were still fully functional ...
i waited a long time for a body like that ...
due to my research ... it was possible to connect the brain and the heart and form a human being .
you were damn lucky , kid !
bullshit !
i was fragmented and patched up again !
don't worry !
reassambling head and body is quite easy .
unfortunately , i ran out of money .
someday ...
i'll design your whole body out of metal ...
out of metal ...?
yes .
bullets will ricochet off your body .
do you understand?
your skills are exceptional !
your left eye can see infrared , and your right one can see the future !
even if your eyes are removed from your head , they still see everything !
your ears can hear every sound within a radius of 2 kilometres !
your physical strength is also supernatural .
even if you have to fight ten men , you'll surely win ...
i don't need that kind of body !
that's monstrous ...
i'd rather die !
i'd rather die "?
apparently you haven't understood yet why you're still alive !
do you want me to thank you for that?
no .
no?
the other man covered you to intercept the bullets .
it was his will that saved you !
tosa had ...
i told you so .
i transplanted his heart into your body .
he still lives inside of your body ...
is the heart the only organ that you tranplanted?
arms and legs were also transplanted and redesigned .
i also copied the nerve tracks that are responsible for ... coordination and fighting spirit .
what else?
the dick .
the dick ...
including the balls !
i have tosa's dick now ...
well , yours was still functional , but ...
you're the strongest of all men now !
by no means you may betray somebody !
an furthermore ...
tosa ...
i have a request .
can you finish the tattoo?
onigiri ...
first and foremost , you have to eat metal .
it's the ultimative energy source for your body .
is it good?
that's not important .
slowly but surely , you'll lose your human emotions .
but if you're overwhelmed by strong feelings all the same ... you may not be able to control yourself .
the results are a loss of energy , system errors and a complete short .
just take good care of yourself ...
i'm going to lose my feelings ...?
to love someboy , hating , getting angry , crying ...
you can do without stuff like that , can't you?
oh , no ...
i installed a system that's going to soothe you in case of emergency .
if you feel that your emotions are going to overwhelm you ...
in this case , push that button and repeat the magic formula .
magic formula?
hush , little baby , don't say a word
you have to repeat it three times .
what ...? !
it's a lullaby .
my granny used to sing that song to me when i was little .
defence against an attack from the right side .
defence against an attack from the left side .
it's exactly the same .
move forward .
withdraw .
there we are !
perfect .
what are you doing? !
what are you gonna do?
i'm going away .
you're going away?
why? !
somebody killed us .
i'm not willing to accept that .
just don't do anything stupid !
do you want to take revenge?
you should be a lover of justice !
come on !
repeat the magic formula .
hush , little baby , don't say a word
if you can't control your feelings , you'll get lost !
doctor .
i'm a yakuza .
there are a few things i simply have to do ... before i lose my emotions .
no , you're a hero !
don't overexert yourself !
don't let your feelings overwhelm you !
it's me .
what's up?
red just left .
then go and capture him immediately !
don't worry .
i have an eye on every move he makes .
i'll watch his fighting strenght prospering .
did you call the general?
that's not necessary .
idiot !
what was that? !
from the hip , understand?
yes !
the successor hates nothing more than bad golfers .
and as long as you play that lousy , i can't introduce you to him .
i'm sorry !
idiot !
the boss can't do anything but retire ... if his successor nominates me for his representative .
the successor's time has come !
yes !
go on !
yes !
you idiot !
watch out !
yes !
stop stupid idiot !
tosa is dead !
brother ...? !
what was that ...?
you survived , hagane ...? !
a doctor saved my life .
did he save brother tosa , too?
hey , what's up?
was tosa saved , too?
are you sure?
i see .
hagane .
could you tell the boss about that?
yeah?
he's completely sure that tosa's still alive !
yeah?
brother .
could you tell me what happened?
who attacked brother tosa and me?
no idea ...
i want to know why you betrayed us !
no ... !
hagane !
i ...
i just want to take revenge ...
brother ...
he smushed my hands ...
shut up !
go and tell nakamura !
we wanted to get rid of hagane anyway , you idiot .
so take care of it !
brother !
cut it out , brother .
what's the matter with you?
stop it .
you're not tosa , that's not for you , brother .
i can talk to maeda .
you say that you're sorry , and then you're in again !
junji .
are you in love with naomi?
i won't let you ... make her miserable .
what's going on?
all of a sudden , you're so cool ...
are you sure that he'll come?
yes .
is that a blackout?
hey .
hey !
patronage !
well , well !
i'm here to talk to the boss .
asshole .
you bastard !
asshole !
just you wait !!
stop !!
is that a monster? !
we shot him , but he's still alive !
hurry up and do something !
wait !
let's talk about it !
i'm here to avenge yoichi tosa's death !
i'll revenge tosa ...
no !
it was mutsumis idea alone !
he set the whole thing up .
maeda did it !
they wanted to get rid of tosa !
what an asshole !
who sold the corpse and took the money for it?
i didn't do it !
maeda said ...
he promised that ... he'd leave the two bodies to me !
two bodies?
right from the start ...?
he made me do it !
he told me to do in the man next to tosa , too .
he told me that this man ...
what did he tell you ...? !
this man ...
he was worth nothing .
if he was dead , we would at least get some money !
they don't know anything about your skills !
hey !
team up with me !
just tell me what you want !
okay?
scum ... !
hey !
let's go !
what's up?
this bastard hagane !
go and get him !
what? !
yokoi ... !
hey !
hagane !!
i'll keep an eye on the boss .
finish him off !
hey !
show me what you got .
but !
first , i think you should see ... that i'm wearing tosa's tattoo on my back !
you're really cool ...
you bastard !
what ...? !
do something !
hagane !
i didn't order to kill tosa !
he did !
he did it !
maeda set up the whole thing !
and you expect me to believe that?
it's the truth !
i swear !
you have to believe me !
is that tattoo really tosa's?
what does that mean?
some parts of brother tosa's body ... were transplanted into mine .
what?
transplanted?
brother tosa ...
he's living on inside of my body .
forgive me , tosa !
it was all my fault !
so i haven't lost you forever .
i was so stupid , so goddam stupid !
i was an idiot , please forgive me !
forgive me ...
hagane .
hagane !
from now on , you'll do maeda's job !
do you understand?
let us fight together !
first , we'll finish off the musashi group !
okay? !
don't kid me !
i won't let anybody pull a fast one on me ever again !
hey ... !
you're breaking my arm !
stop it !
breaking your arm won't be enough !
i'm gonna kill you !!
let him go .
taka ...
you can't kill me with that thing .
i'm going to shoot at you anyway .
i beg you , taka .
don't try to stop me !
i have to revenge brother tosa !
if you want to kill somebody , you'll have to start with me .
i won't let anybody attack my boss .
i'll fight anybody and risk my life to save the boss .
the nakame group was finished off .
brother maeda is dead , too .
that's more than enough , kei .
the monster and other tales
disqualified as a human being
pinocchio
you can try to hide , but i'll find you wherever you are .
this is the only place that you can return to .
damn it !
why do i always get bodies in such a poor condition? !
the peach ranger ... still has room for improvement ...
it's huge ... !
it was nine years ago .
he left me .
he said that together with him , i'd never be happy .
after that , he lunged at those guys to kill them .
he was a yakuza .
he had to do seven years .
he was killed right after he was released from prison .
he was such an idiot !
what are you doing here?
i drifted for some time ...
i feel attracted to this place .
attracted?
tosa
but i just understood why i'm here .
this place is something like ... my home ...
it's strange .
near you i feel like ... he's right next to me .
but you don't resemble him in any way ...
hey ...
i'd like to stay for a while ...
hush , little baby , don't say a word ...
what does that mean?
that's a magic formula .
it soothes me when i get too upset .
why?
he's been there for three months ...
why?
your hands are as cold as ice ...
cold hands , warm heart " ...
i can't believe it ...
your hands ...
they look exactly like my boyfriend's hands ...
i beg you .
just once ...
i want you to sleep with me .
i want to forget him !
i finally want to get rid of him !
i wanted to fall in love with another man , but i couldn't .
but i really believe that with you , i could finally forget him .
yukari ...
don't you like me , keisuke?
i do .
then what's the reason? !
i can't .
i like you ...
i really do ...
but my body is ...
i don't care !
i know that you have complexes because of your body .
but i don't care about the way you look ...
i love you !
the better part of my body was destroyed in an accident .
half my body consists of metal .
i'm an ugly monster !
are you scared?
i love you anyway !
no !!
good bye , keisuke .
i wanted to stay longer .
but ...
but as long as we're together ...
i won't be able to forget him .
i can't love you both at the same time ...
5 5 3
not bad ... !
things are going well today , aren't they?
the wheather is great , too !
deputy of the boss ...
how do you feel?
well , it's a start .
i see things exactly the way the successor does .
there's gonna be a lot of change .
you're pretty ambitious , right?
hey , caddy !
pitch !
i'll revenge him !!
get up !
hey , is everything okay?
take care of him !
hey !
who are you?
hey !
tosa's girlfriend?
i'm gonna kill you !!
hey !
leave that to me !
brother !
brother !
are you dead or something?
what ...?
you're still alive !
you know that woman , don't you?
what did you do to yukari? !
what did you do to her? !
i'll tell you !
she tried to kill the representative of the successor and failed !
yomo is one of the boss 'successors? !
she told us your name after we snatched her !
because of that , the boss knew that she knows where you are ...
hello?
hey , hagane ...
you're very strong ...
you already ruined one of my very expensive carpets ...
what are your demands?
i don't make demands .
i want a lot more than that .
the very best .
understand?
you'll kill the president of the musashi group .
if you succeed , i'll give that woman back to you .
she's missing tosa's back ... she said ...
you bastard !!
help me ...
don't worry !
the representative is really afraid of you .
because of that , he won't kill the woman .
kei , it's me .
don't worry about the woman .
you'll get her back .
what about the musashi group?
otsuki , the vice president , is going to be the group's new leader .
the representative will be killed .
what about you , taka?
if they're all dead , i'm going to be the boss .
good .
that will restore calm within our group for a while .
kei .
it's not too late .
don't you want to extend the mutsumi group with me?
that was our dream , wasn't it?
i can't do that anymore .
kei ...
everytime i kick up , you pull in your horn .
you're right .
what's up?
i have to hang up now , kei .
good bye .
go !
keep on searching !
hey !
i found something !
too bad ...
he could have served me well .
he could have been useful for the fight against the western groups ...
don't worry about that .
now we just have to find the man who saved him .
he has to build more soldiers for us .
yes , exactly .
soldiers who work for us ...
everything's ready .
okay .
this way , please .
president .
i prepared everything for you ...
you did?
oh , yeah !
shit !!
i can't believe they want to get rid of me , too !
from now on , i'll do anything you say , brother !
brother !
please , you have to revenge us !
she's asleep ...
president .
have fun !
she's really good ...
hey ...
let the boy begin .
hey , matsuba !
go ahead .
stop it , taka !!
hey ...
she still got all her teeth , but do you want to give it a try?
it's not so bad ...
come on , purse your lips !
hey !
that stupid cow !
damn it , that doesn't do it ...
hey !
they're leaving !
thank you .
thank you .
you should try that , too .
thanks .
oh god , i'm sick .
go !
hagane !
that's too laborious .
run over him .
hey !!
what ...?
hey !!
hey !
finish him off !
kei !
that was really cool !
clear off , taka !
taka !
i beg you !
i can't do this ...
and that's why everybody says ... that you aren't a proper yakuza !
but i won't run away !
i'm a yakuza .
taka ...
it hurts ...
it's bleeding ...
i'm alive , right? !
i'm ...
i'm still a human being , right? !
kei !
good bye .
hey !
anybody here?
no one there?
hey !
hagane !
hey !
hey !
all the idiots are gone ...
full metal ...
yakuza ...
brother ...
is he dead?
