your favorite simulation .
just killing time .
you want to spar?
as you wish .
that was too easy .
what's the problem?
where's your concentration?
maybe you regret taking the red pill .
maybe .
it crosses everyone's mind at least once .
the wish to return to an ordinary life .
a carefree life in the country .
the life we had before knowing all this .
even if that life was just an illusion?
it's ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world .
finally starting to warm up .
listen to me .
i have something i want to talk to you about .
it's all right .
i've blocked the signal so no one else can hear us .
so , what?
you gonna propose?
i'm going back to the matrix and i want you to come with me .
come on , be serious , duo .
stop teasing me .
i am serious , and you know it .
i really thought you'd be with me on this .
anyway , it's done and it's all been settled with them .
what do you mean , it's all been settled?
this is the only way .
it's just a matter of time before zion is wiped out .
come with me .
stop it .
please do not do this to me , duo .
we can't .
we can !
i've come to my senses .
you should do the same .
i took the red pill because i wanted to know the truth .
but i don't care about the truth anymore .
what's real doesn't matter .
what's important is how we live our lives .
are you listening to me?
you know i'm right .
but we can't go back , duo .
we know the truth now .
we can forget all of this .
duo ...
i know how .
trust me .
don't be afraid to look into your heart .
say what you're really feeling .
tell me .
i can't .
i don't know .
running away won't change anything !
you're the one that's running away !
stop pretending !
enough , duo .
i've had enough !
there's no time .
they're on their way .
you betrayed us , didn't you?
operator , please !
get me out of here right now .
operator , i need an exit !
it's no use .
i told you .
i've blocked your signal .
you won't stop me .
this is your last chance .
the choice isn't that hard .
come with me .
you can forget about it , duo .
i won't look away from the truth .
i can't .
that's too bad .
i'm sorry .
i wanted to go back with you .
i love you .
no !
relax , you're okay .
easy , cis , settle down .
he was just part of the training program .
he's just a simulation .
it's over .
it was a test .
judgment .
concentration .
technique .
high scores on everything .
now , get some rest .
you okay?
i feel a lot better now .
except for that last part ... ... i'd say she passed .
