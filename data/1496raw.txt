my name is lawrence gordon .
i'm a doctor .
i just woke up here , like you .
aaaarghh !
recognise him?
no .
do you have any idea how you got here?
no .
what's the last thing you remember?
nothing .
i went to bed in my shit hole apartment , and woke up in an actual shit hole .
what about you , huh?
there's ...
there's not much to tell .
i was on my way home from work and
i don't remember anything else .
first dead body i've ever seen .
they hook different in real life
they don't move .
from the looks of these chains , someone didn't want us to go very far , either .
can you see any scars?
what?
man , they kidnap you and drug you .
before you know , you're in a bath and your kidneys are on ebay .
no one has taken your kidneys .
how can you tell from way over there?
you'd either be in terrible agony , or you'd be dead by now .
trust me .
what are you , a surgeon?
yeah
so ...
are you gonna tell me your name , or what?
adam .
well , adam ...
what we need to do ... is start thinking about why we're here .
whoever brought us here could have killed us by now
but they didn't
they must want something from us .
the question is , what?
that chock what about it?
it's brand new .
so?
so ... somebody obviously wanted us to know the time .
wait .
i think .
i might be able to reach the door
what is that?
excuse me .
it's a tape .
where did you find it?
it was in my pocket .
it says " play me
come on .
come on .
throw it over here
fuck .
no?
use your shirt .
what?
your shit
come on
it won't work .
look around .
there must be something else you can use .
there's nothing .
well , there must be something .
come on .
you can do it
come on .
come on .
again
rise and shine adam
you're probably wondering where you are
i'll tell you where you might be
you might be in the room that you die in
up until now you've simply sat in the shadows watching others live out their lives
but what do voyeurs see when they hook into the mirror?
now .
i see you as a strange mix of someone angry yet apathetic
but mostly just pathetic
so are you going to watch yourself die today adam or do something about it?
i don't get it .
throw me the player .
no .
you throw me your tape .
look , we're gonna have to work together , if we want to get out of here .
throw it to me i'm not gonna risk breaking it .
you throw me your tape
dr gordon this is your wake up call
every day of your working life you have given people the news that they're gonna die soon
now you will be the cause of death
your aim in this game is to kill adam
you have until 6 on the chock to do it
there's a man in the room with you
when there's that much poison in your blood the only thing heft to do is shoot yourself
there are ways to win this hidden all around you
just remember x marks the spot for the treasure if you do not kill adam by six then alison and diana will die dr gordon
and i'll heave you in this room to rot
let the game begin
give me that .
now .
then alison and diana will die dr gordon and i'll heave you in this room to rot
any idea who that is?
let the game begin
he knows us .
wait a minute .
what do you think?
probably a joke , right?
shh !
let the game begin listen .
listen .
follow your heart
what the hell does " follow your heart " mean?
there , right next to you , on the toilet .
come on .
come on .
oh , man !
anything?
no solids .
take off the lid .
come on
i really wish i had've checked in there first .
huh !
what is it?
hey .
mind passing me the other one?
fuck !
fuck !
he doesn't want us to cut through our chains .
he wants us to cut through our feet .
i think i may know who's done this to us .
what did you say?
well , it's not someone i know personally .
it's just someone i know of .
jesus christ !
tell me .
who is it?
last i heard ... ... the police still hadn't caught him .
and the only reason .
i know that is because .
i was a suspect
i'll start from the beginning
this one's not fresh any more .
at least three weeks out .
victim's a 46 year ohd male
died of massive blood loss mostly through the femoral artery
he started at the back and tunnelled through that razor wire so fast , it's amazing he got as far as he did .
cut himself so deep we found traces of stomach acid on the floor
we also found this .
hello paul .
you are a perfectly healthy sane middle class male yet hast month you ran a straight razor across your wrists
did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die or did you just want some attention?
tonight you'll show me
the irony is that if you want to die you just have to stay where you are if you want to live you'll have to cut yourself again
find a path through the razor wire to the door
but hurry
at three o'clock that door will hock
and then this room becomes your tomb
how much blood will you shed to stay alive paul?
door was on a timer .
it was unlocked until three o'clock .
then it slammed shut .
he was given two hours .
you sick fuck !
a jigsaw piece
i think we're gonna be here for a while , sing .
the newspapers started calling him " the jigsaw killer
actually , technically speaking , he's ... not really a murderer .
he never killed anyone .
he finds ways for his victims to kill themselves
hello mark if you're so sick then why do .
i have so many photos of you up and about?
let's put your so called illness to the test
right now there's a show acting poison in your veins
the antidote is inside the safe
help !
the combination to the safe is written on the wall
hurry up and program it in
but watch your step
by the way that's a flammable substance smeared on your body
so .
i would be careful with that candle if i were you
or all the people you've burned with your act just might have their revenge
aaaarghh !
i found something else .
well , two things , actually .
there was someone standing outside , watching through this hole .
our friend jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his own sick little games .
he was there at the hast one as well
only , this time ... he left us his penlight .
hm ...
get a rush on the prints .
copy that .
this patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumour extending across the midline .
it started as colon cancer .
the patient has come in for a standard checkup , by which we can monitor the rate at which his condition is declining .
the patient had ...
his name is john .
dr gordon .
he's a very interesting person .
thank you for that information , zep .
as you can see our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients
continuing on the patient had
dr gordon please page the operator
someone doesn't want me to tell you what the patient had !
excuse me .
dr gordon .
i'm detective tapp , this is detective sing .
city homicide .
very impressive .
oh , thank you .
i do my best .
sorry to interrupt you while you work .
fine
now , how can i help you gentlemen?
are you able to tell us where you were between the hours of 11 pm and 1 am last night?
why is it that you're interested?
we'd like to ask a few questions about it .
for your sake , i think it's best if we do it down at the station .
would you like to follow us there?
i'm afraid that's out of the question .
i can't just leave .
i have work to do .
plus my wife has the car today .
that's ok .
you can ride with us .
doc?
i'm sorry .
you'll have to tell me again .
what is this all about?
is this yours , doctor?
so you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene?
of course not , brett .
well , i have to ask .
what were you doing last night?
i was seeing someone .
who?
look , if you can't be honest with me ...
i was visiting someone .
it wasn't a patient .
all right?
what am i gonna do?
well , as your lawyer and your friend , my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now , cos no one's gonna believe you hater
that was five months ago .
he tried to set me up for murder .
ok .
we checked your alibi .
it holds up .
good .
can i go home now?
we have one of the victims who managed to escape .
want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking around and listening to her testimony .
maybe it'll trigger something .
i'd like to help , really , but ...
well , we'd appreciate it .
she's the only one who made it .
ok .
amanda ...
in your own time ... tell me the first thing you remember .
i woke up
all .
i could taste was blood
and metal
hello amanda
you don't know me but .
i know you
i want to play a game
here's what happens if you hose
the device you're wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws
when the timer on the back goes off your mouth will be permanently ripped open
think of it like a reverse bear trap
here i'll show you
there's only one key to open the device it's in the stomach of your dead cellmate
look around amanda
know that i'm not lying
you'd better hurry up
live or die
make your choice
no !
and then i saw the body .
there was a knife .
he'd been injected with an opiate overdose
couldn't move or feel much of anything
you mean ... he was alive?
was .
what happened after you took it off?
congratulations .
you are still alive
most people are so ungrateful to be alive .
but not you .
not any more .
you are , in fact , a drug addict .
isn't that right , mandy?
do you think that is why he picked you?
are you grateful mandy?
he ... helped me .
are you sure it's him?
yeah , i'm sure .
how do .
i know you're telling the truth?
you could be the one who put me in this room !
i'm in exactly the same situation you're in .
wrong .
wrong !
you've got one thing i don't .
information .
you know who did this .
now , you either tell me what is really going on , or i'll cut you with this !
i'll cu ...
what?
it's a two way mirror .
i can see you .
so that's what this is reality tv
don't look at me .
i can't help you .
can you hear me in there?
huh?
i'm having a blast .
this is the most fun i've had without lubricant .
make sure you're getting everything .
that's not gonna do anything .
you want to heave it running on us?
you won't stop it
that's why we can't cut through these chains or why you won't break that glass .
every possible angle has been pre thought out by him .
you make it sound like you admire this prick .
to overcome something , you have to understand what a perfect engine it is .
that's how you fight disease
the tape told us to find an x
that x has to be somewhere in this room .
help me find it .
how can you be the calm doctor when your wife and kid are out there?
he has them too he could be doing anything to them now
are you thinking about that?
i am thinking about that .
i've been thinking about the last thing i said to my daughter .
diana , honey , are you ok?
diana , honey , can you hear me?
mommy ...
what is it , sweet pea?
there's a man in my room .
oh , honey , are you sure he's not just hiding in your imagination?
he talked to me .
ok .
i'll come and check your room .
i want daddy .
he'll get the scary man .
all right , if you want .
come on .
larry , sorry to bother you , but your daughter had a bad dream again .
just a minute .
she wants you to check her room .
mm hm .
just got to finish this paragraph .
come on , sweetie .
i'll check with you .
nope .
i'm done .
see?
there's no one in your room .
there's no such thing as the bad man .
now can you go to sleep?
i m still scared
you are?
give me your tootsie .
oh , what a big tootsie .
remember this one?
this little piggy went to market .
this little piggy stayed home .
this little piggy had roast beef .
this little piggy had none .
this little piggy ran ...
whee !
all the way home !
i hate that thing .
well , i have to go to work , sweetheart .
you know what daddy's job is like .
now , come on .
let's see .

that's right .
good night , sweetie .
good night , daddy .

i'll read you your favourite story .

i don't know how much longer .
i can do this
what are you talking about?
how can you pretend you're happy?
i am happy .
that is complete bullshit .
i d rather you just tell me you hate me
at least there would be some passion in it
would you like to see her?
she's beautiful .
thank you
you gonna have any more kids?
ah , we've ... talked about it , but er ... ... with our schedules , it's difficult enough to concentrate on one .
so , where's the lucky wife?
there's another picture behind the one you're looking at .
it's my favourite one because we're all in it together
someone , usually me , has to hold the camera , which means i'm always missing from the photos
it's er ...
it's not here .
what?
this photo you're talking about's not here .
really?
are you sure?
yeah .
just ...
why , he ... he must have taken it .
i ...
how can you pretend you're happy?
i am happy .
that is complete bullshit .
i'd rather you just tell me you hate me .
at least there would be some passion in it .
we'll talk about this later .
ok?
just leave .

she told me you knew me .
who are you?
you know who i am .
stop the lies !
you're a liar !
i need to know the truth !
i'm a liar?
what did you do last night , lawrence?
work at a hospital saving sick children?
you told me that after you left your house last night , you went to work at a hospital
that's because it's the truth .
no it's not
your wife is right , larry .
you don't recall getting your picture taken in that parking hot?
i can prove that you didn't go anywhere near a hospital last night .
it's not the first time i've done it either , larry .
i ve been taking pictures of you for days now
why?
you want to know what .
i do?
i get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you , who go to seedy motels to fuck their secretaries .
last night .
i went to your house and watched you heave
i followed you all the way to that shit bag hotel
you've er ... had these with you the whole time?
i found them in there with the hack saws .
i don't know how they got there
right !
you're so full of it !
face it , larry , we're both bullshitters !
but my camera isn't .
it doesn't know how to lie
it only shows you what's put right in front of it .
just out of curiosity , what did you do in that motel room?
you got out of there pretty fast
why did you um ... deem it necessary to page me when you knew i was at home?
i didn't know if you were going to make it .
i gave you a precise time at which to page me .
you can't do that .
it's not like i know the rules for this sort of stuff .
what's wrong , dr gordon?
look , um ...
it was wrong of me to make you come here .
but i thought we've ...
no , no .
please .
i'm sorry .
you tell anyone you were here?
no .
hello .
it's for you .
for me?
hello .
i know what you're doing doctor
i ...
i have to go .
what happened?
i gotta go .
who was it?
who was what?
the person who paid you to follow me .
who was it?
he calls himself bob and he gives me the money upfront .
200 bucks a night .
if i'd known i'd end up here , i'd have asked for a lot more .
what does that mean?
does that mean you saw what happened to me?
what i saw was you get into your car .
that's it .
i didn't ask your name i didn't know who you were
i don't know how i got here .
i don't know how you got here .
i took the shots and went straight home to develop them
next thing i know , i'm chained to a pipe in some prehistoric bathroom , staring at the guy i've been taking shots of .
clearly , whoever paid you to take pictures of me is the one who put us here .
maybe .
of course it is !
what did he look like?
just a guy was he tall?
skinny?
obese?
i don't take notes .
you must remember something about him .
i can't .
you don't remember a thing about the guy?
i told you , i ...
for fuck's sake !
i give up !
he's a tall black guy .
he's got a scar around his neck , ok?
tapp .
detective tapp .
whoa
the guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop .
no , no .
