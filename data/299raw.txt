being a policeman is not what you see on tv .
i've never had to pick between the red and blue wires .
never had to jump across rooftops .
i investigate crimes , track leads . . .
but i've done it for 28 years .
i'm a detective .

lf you break the law . . .
i won't say that i succeed every time .
any questions?

the fun days .
i chased him over three roofs .
you can't do this !
you destroyed a city block !
he fired first .
i should read him his rights?
you should've called for backup .
my only backup is in a hospital bed !
jimay didn't make it .
oh , god .
oh , god , no .
he was talking about getting out .
it's hard .
he was like a brother to me , captain .
since we was kids , we was partners .
we used to hang out . . . . . . and dream about being on the force together .
that was the dream .
just two little lrish boys . . . . . . fighting , scrapping , thinking about making a difference .
god , i'm gonna miss him !
i'll need your gun and your shield , pete .
i may be off the force , but i am not off this case !

they said you could have killed their cameraman .
maybe i should have killed him .
the chief already cut the deal .

that's extortion !
they can't do that .
we need good pr .
community relations are in the toilet .

look , i did an episode of cops once .
you did an episode of cops?
you forget the camera is even there .

i'm not an actor .
no one is saying you can't work .
but you screwed up .
and now you've got to play ball .
end of story .
you'll be reporting to the show's producer , chase renzi .
chase renzi? ls that a real name?
i won't take orders from some coked out hollywood dickhead .

she's outside , waiting for you .
well .
better looking than i thought .
we gotta bring in color , some light .

tell him to get the cuffs off .
i told you i can't do handcuffs .
never seen him before .
just another criminal .
bullshit .
we took a stage combat class together last fall .
nice try , pal .
he's just trying to weasel his way out of the crime .
that's what he's doing .
he looks like a real menace .
who wants to explain?
trey said he'd give me $50 if i snatched the lady's purse and ran .
he'd pull up in his police car , jump out . . . . . . chase me up a fence , beat me down , kick me
all right , all right .
okay .
i set the whole thing up .
it was a big setup .
i set it up to make it look like i was . . . .
i was auditioning to get this part .
what part?
it won't be this moron .
i should report you for impersonating a cop .
why you take everything so seriously?
you should be protecting , not staging crimes .
you got the part already .
i'm just trying to spruce it up .
that's what you normally do at work .
better watch your mouth .
what are you gonna do , wrap me up in caution tape?
no , i ain't gonna wrap you up in caution tape .

the guy's a joke .
there's no way i'll work with him .
i don't want to hear it .

we jump over hoods .
something you'd know .
freeze !
okay , mitch .
come here .
i'm not going on the hood of a car .
what do you mean?

i'll show you .
you gotta stop them , see?

okay .
let's taste some drugs .
hooker's got a bag of white powder in his hand .
spears it open with a pocketknife .
takes his little pinkie . . . . . . in the powder .
and he touches it , gently , on his tongue .
watch the eyebrows .
hooker knows it's cocaine .
what if it's cyanide?
hello?
hold on .
there's a reason real cops don't taste drugs , bill .
okay , i'm on my way .
it's tricky .
where are you going?
i gotta wash this shit out of my hair .
we have some action?
we have some action , finally .
ln the wheel , the glove compartment and a crook cam in the back .
pretend they're not there .
pretend .

you're catching on already .
we'll be right behind you in the van .
you'll be right behind me?
what are you doing?
unbelievable .
what's the mean face for?
listen .
don't speak , listen .
first of all , you gotta know that i got your back covered . . . . . . and i gotta know you got mine covered .
no doubt .
when we're on the job you're the only person i can depend on .
you got that?
that's important .
there's no other way .
and it's gotta start right now .
you know , ever since i was 8 , i wanted to be a cop .
he was the first in the family on the force .
big muscles .
uncle reggie .
he used to let me ride in the squad car with him .
. . . l knew i was gonna be a cop .
uncle reggie .
yeah .
my uncle
uncle reggie passed away two years ago .
he got caught in the line of some fire .
didn't slow me down .
i remember how he set me on my way .
he's looking down on me from a big precinct in the sky .
he's thinking , " you've done all right , trey .
you've done right by me .
that " i'm your partner . " that was a speech .
you burned up 90 seconds of air .
that was a speech .
when we get to the crime scene , stay out of my way .
this isn't studio shit .
this is real .
get your camera out of here .
hey , watch it .
julio has to shoot .
that's the show .
that's right .
whatever you need , i'm there .
lf i get shot , stabbed , it's cool .
whatever .
i'm getting good footage .
go to trey .
i'm trey .
julio .
you worked on springer?
springer , girls gone wild .
get that camera out of here .
who's in the bag?
we don't know yet .
whoever shot him didn't care for open caskets .
thinking what i'm thinking?
. . . cleaning the streets up on they own terms , partner .
this is payback for a drug deal gone sour .
whoever this guy worked for got pissed .
good thinking , partner .
good thinking .
i think i can identify one of the victims .
those are 1 2 gauge , armor piercing uranium shells .
charlie .
hey , mitchell .
i found explosive and incendiary rounds scattered around .
it appears to be hand held , automatic , with interchangeable magazines .
technically , this gun doesn't exist .
speak english .
any idea who made it?
it's out of eastern europe .
thanks , charlie .
keep your eyes open .
you bet .
what are you doing?
take it easy .
you're not supposed to touch .
i didn't .
i turned it over .
let me know when you touch  i don't have to
what's going on?
he's contaminating my crime scene .
i'm doing a sweep of the area .
you never know where a crucial bit of evidence may be hiding .
did anybody think to pull some prints off this water bottle?
can i get an evidence bag?
that's an honest mistake . evidence so i thought it was ...
hey , t. j. , go solve the case somewhere else .
don't give me orders , i'm your partner !
no , i partner with real cops .
get me a copy of that report .
all right , mitch .
well , i am your partner , so you better accept that .
i am your partner !
he won't open up .
you know how hard it is to work with somebody like that?
i know .
mitch has been a lot more resistant than i'd hoped for .
i think that you and mitch need some bonding time .
you're right .
we do .
we need some qt time together .
two guys hanging out , have some beers .
i'll call to see if he wants to hang out .
let's not call him .
let's just go over .
just show up?
surprise him .
what are you doing?
how hard is it to say , " hi , trey , nice to see you "?
hi , trey .
what are you doing here?
we got off on the wrong foot .
i got some food .
we can eat the food and bond a bit .
bond?
yeah .
how'd you get my address?
hi , mitch .
oh , shit .
do i have to?
i gotta see where my star cop lives .
come on , mitch .
oh , my god .
mitch . . . !
got a little smell to it .
not a stinky smell , an odd one .
what is that smell?
ls this here your actual living area?
what's the problem?
like a trailer on the beach or a loft downtown .
that kind of thing .
your research shows that , huh?
where does he live?
i rent a guesthouse from a producer .
kind of gives off a magnum vibe .
totally .
it's unique .
you know what , mitch?
we can make this work .
did a crackhead make this cup?
no .
it's just .
the point is to let the audience in on all aspects of your life .
mitch , i think you need some time away from the job .
i just found the crackhead's shop .
hey , don't go in there .
this is what you smell all over the place .
wow , a pottery studio !
you're full of surprises .

this room's off limits .
it's not for show .
okay , mitch .
bond with yourself , i got work to do .
check this out .
must be some hollywood dickhead .

twice .
and you think you won't fail again?
