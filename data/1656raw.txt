what time did you get back?
you don`t want to know .
was it worth it?
did he sign the contract?
yes .
what a genius .
how did you do it?
i did it the old fashioned way .
i begged .
good morning , roy and mary .
what time`s my doctor`s appointment?
i had no idea you had one .
coffee , roy?
yeah .
are you sick?
a wolf bit me .
i just asked .
are you going to alden`s party?
probably .
he invites everybody over to iet them know if they stiii have a job .
you have no appointment .
but he`ii see you before 12 .
if you get the axe tonight , i go with you .
so do i.
listen , you need your pay cheques .
i forbid you to take any action if i`m fired .
right .
maude waggins is waiting in your office .
i cannot write for a conglomerate .
protect me .
raymond alden isn`t a conglomerate , he`s a biilionaire .
and i`m not sure if i`m going to be here after the takeover .
you`re the senior editor .
your name , your reputation ...
my reputation has been in question ever since i told judith krantz
that no 14 year old would read her fiction .
builshit !
sit down .
maude .
the good news is that the head of marketing is my friend and protege .
if i ieave . he`li ieave with me .
i know they don`t want to iose him .
that may give me some ieverage .
i`ii ieave with you , too !
howw`s that for ieverage?
let`s go and see your protege .
wiilie . just the man i wanted to see .
maude waggins .
you saved my iife .
while reading `" what about us girls? `` ...
you realised you had to write .
no , i stopped .
i realised that if this was talent .
i had none .
how nice that it should stop you .
i adore you .
i taught him to do that .
i used to hit my authors .
maude wants in if we ieave .
do you know what her contract cails for?
she`s obligated to one more book .
we get first iook at her next two .
how about an 80 page reminiscence of aii the restaurants i`ve loved?
there are no specifications in the contract .
i`li start eating out right now .
you are a rarity .
a ioyai man , with a great taste in authors .
bye , wiil .
i`ii see you at jason`s .
you`re such a polished ass kisser it takes my breath away .
i kiss `em iike i see `em .
a wolf in vermont .
i don`t think so .
wiil .
you weren`t there .
you sure it wasn`t a husky?
after ail . it was dark out .
there was a fuii moon .
it was a wolf .
i was staring straight at it .
you don`t confuse a dog with a wolf .
i see .
funny , this isn`t the first rabies shot i`ve given recently .
my wife`s sister in iaw in oneonta , a raccoon bit her in the ass .
my friend`s son sustained brain damage from a snake bite .
he was by the pool , next thing he has brain damage .
is he aii right?
no , you idiot , he`s brain damaged .
i see time warner as a bunch of decent caring people .
money doesn`t always imply ruthless ambition .
am i insane?
i would say so , yes .
he`s so charming .
because the rainforest is being destroyed so rapidly ,
ail these viruses are going to colonise the world .
they`ii kiii off the population .
i`m only quoting ``the new yorker`` .
everyone`s trying to say the world wiii end if we have no rainforests .
you could make a case that the world has already ended .
that art is dead .
instead of art we have pop culture and daytime tv .
women who`ve been raped by their dentists confiding in oprah .
an exploration in depth of why women cut off their husbands` penises .
time to fiii up the glass .
yes .
iet`s have a drink .
relax .
eat something .
at ieast get a meal out of this .
i didn`t iike the food .
aii that red meat dripping blood .
you`re fun to eat with .
mr. alden would like to see you . ``never send to know for whom the beii toils .
it toils ... " `
wiii ... just remember who you are .
charm him .
you can be charming when you want to .
why is he doing it this way?
it`s kinder face to face .
cigar?
don`t mind if i do .
i want you to think about europe .
eastern europe , particularly .
there`s a whole new market opening up there .
god and currency wiiling , the entire continent wiii cohere .
both economicaily and culturaily .
i want that to be your area .
i see ...
then my area wiii no ionger be editor in chief after the takeover?
there`s nothing personal , you know that .
you`re clearly a man of taste and individuality .
but these days , aii around the globe ,
taste and individuality are actuaily a handicap .
then what of my successor?
is he a vulgar conformist?
drive .
hustle . drive and 52 carat ambition .
he nagged me day and night untii i gave him yourjob .
treat the authors as human beings .
don`t stint on review copies .
don`t hold them to deadlines . they`ii only turn in rough drafts .
thank you , i`ii remember that .
you`re a nice person , wiil .
thank god i replaced you .
i hope you give eastern europe a shot .
you`d better put that out .
horses don`t iike it .
i think i`ii finish it .
go ahead .
good cigar , isn`t it?
this is the prize .
fort knox .
drink it .
good boy .
i`m afraid i ... finished your drink .
what are you?
the iast civilised man?
i`m ... ... just embarrassed .
half the people here use thorazine , so a iittle anxiety is okay .
you`re very kind .
no .
i`m not .
i`m laura alden .
alden is my father .
i`m wiii randail .
nice to meet you .
you don`t seem surprised .
not tonight .
he just fired you , didn`t he?
demoted is the word .
i have a choice between no job and a job no one would want .
what wiii you do?
take the job no one would want .
i don`t have the courage to be jobless at my age .
old guy?
yeah ...
old guy .
weii ...
i`d better get back .
was that on purpose?
no ...
you`re perfectly safe .
i`m married .
and that makes you perfectly safe?
yes ...
you better clean yourself up if you`re gonna face the crowd .
here , wipe your face .
it`s aii sweaty .
there you are , dear .
aii ready for company .
thank you .
how did it go?
speak , we`ve been going nuts .
first , iet me say congratulations on being the new editor in chief .
what ..?
alden said that?
what did he say?
he cailed this evening and told me he wanted me to take the job .
i said that it was yourjob .
i didn`t know if he was serious .
i didn`t ask for this .
say the word , i`ii turn it down .
what should i do?
that`s up to you , stewart .
no , it`s up to you .
i`li do whatever you say .
you`re asking the one person who can`t advise you .
shit !
i`m sorry you said that .
that son of a bitch !
prick !
i had no idea he was offered yourjob .
alden must have made a good offer , but he could have told you .
why didn`t you say something?
you iet him walk away guilt free .
charlotte , please ...
i can`t talk now .
may i just say one more thing about it?
no .
wiil . come on . it`s 7 : 30 .
give me tiii eight .
will?
it`s 7 : 40 .
i asked you to give me tili eight .
it`s 7 : 40 at night , you dope .
you`ve slept aii day .
are you aii right?
how do you feel?
i feei ... ... good .
i said , `" why assign me mastectomies and oestrogen therapy? `` ``let me do genetic engineering .
give pete mastectomies . ``
you know what he said? `" you`li do it so much better , you`re a woman . ``
i said , ``that`s iike teiling a black food writer ... `` hey !
i have to catch up .
i haven`t eaten .
i haven`t drunk .
i haven`t made love in a iong time .
a very iong time .
do you think we ought to do it right here in front of the church?
what else do you do without hands?
you`ii see .
what was in that stew?
good morning .
lt`s a bit early to be drinking?
how the fuck did you know?
you can smeii it a mile away .
mr. randail , are you aii right?
perfectly .
i heard about alden`s decision .
i`m so sorry .
was stewart just in here?
not just .
about an hour ago .
that`s how i found out .
are you aii right?
i`m fine .
i want to say i think it sucks .
thank you , roy .
what did you do , get contacts?
i`ii be damned ...
you`ve edited about 60 pages since monday .
what are you on?
nothing .
i just caught up on my sleep .
i got 20 hours of sleep and i feei 20 years younger .
and so now you can see without your glasses?
yeah , you`ve got a point .
you know whathe said?
how could you drink this early?
i put some tequila in my coffee and he said he smeiled it .
alden replaced randall .
are yousure?
lt" s official .
will randall" s out stewart swinton" s in .
get me gary on the phone .
a manuai on owning animals?
no .
animai possession .
demonic possession .
possession of the spirit by animals .
give me a minute .
how many do you want?
one , the most respectable .
vijav alezais wrote ``something wild`` in 1948 .
old but breathing .
he`s not some kind of mystic?
no . he has ietters after his name .
in fact . he`s doctor alezais .
thank you .
give his number to mary , please .
and , gary , don`t teii people you had tequila with your coffee .
you didn`t have coffee this morning .
hi , i made it to newhaven .
l" il be home tomorrow .
lfyou gethungry , there" s some leftoverstew .
let" s see ifitstill works , you animal !

it`s wiil .
l" il come down .
hey , will .
what`s going on?
what is it?
what`s wrong?
what did he ...
i`m sorry .
i`ii get dressed .
good morning , mr. randail .
i`ve moved to the mayflower .
is that permanent?
yes .
caii iegai and find out if the deal with alden is closed .
get roy to come over with a iist of every author he`s ever worked with .
and a iist of every author i`ve ever worked with .
caii alden and get me an appointment this afternoon .
is the worm turning?
the worm is now packing an uzi .
it`s about fucking time .
shaii i resign today?
promise never to see charlotte again?
just teii me what to do .
resign today .
i can`t do that .
so why did i say it?
i guess it`s just a way of teiling you ... ... how bad i feei about being such a shit .
i love you , will .
i know how that sounds . but i do .
i know how much i`ve hurt you and it kiils me .
i know i can`t ...
you`ii never forgive me , wiii you?
no .
i`d stiii iike one thing .
your permisson to caii alden and teii him to forget eastern europe .
to keep you on as a consultant .
may i do that for you?
i`m gonna get you , stewart .
the deai is not officiaily closed .
mr. alden wiii see you at 12 : 30 .
roy , ask your iist of authors about forming a publishing partnership .
teil them we`re ieaving macleish house ,
whose new policy is to bury everything that doesn`t seil .
teii them we`ve got investors .
two things .
how many investors do we have?
i don`t know .
but i say it anyway .
is any of this true?
not yet .
you`re my god .
you`d better start cailing writers .
begin with maude .
mr. randail .
i wanted to teii you that i`m turning down eastern europe .
i more or iess thought you would .
nice seeing you again , sir .
are you aii right?
are you crazy?
stay away from animals when you know they`re frightened of you !
didn`t you realise that on monday?
your presence disturbs them .
i just wanted to say heilo .
you haven`t failen in years .
here you stiii are .
did you get iost?
no .
we were talking .
henry and caroline are here .
i told them you`d join us .
did you?
what a pity , i`m having iunch with ...
wiil .
it doesn`t reaily matter to laura what your name is , mr. randail .
what is important is that you`re unemployed and i disapprove of you .
we`re going to miss your company .
yes .
i know .
shaii we start cooking?
your place?
a guest house .
i stay here when i`m in town .
i only have peanut butter and jeily .
we`ii have to cancei iunch .
peanut butter and jeily is mother`s milk to me .
whatever you think is going to happen , isn`t .
don`t take anything for granted because we exchanged a few words .
i don`t take anything for granted , except perhaps a iittle civility .
so what do you do?
why do you care?
i don`t .
i was just making polite conversation .
i`d rather not discuss what i do .
i think i understand what you`re iike now .
you think men are only interested in you because you`re beautiful .
but you want them to be interested in you .
the problem is that you`re not very interesting .
you`re rude , you`re hostile , you`re suilen , you`re withdrawn ...
i know you want someone to iook past aii that to what`s underneath .
but the only reason anyone would bother is because you`re beautiful .
ironic , isn`t it?
in an odd way you are your own problem .
sorry , wrong iine .
i`m not shocked by your keen insight and suddenly chailenged by you .
shaii we have the rest of our milk in the iiving room?
are aii these you?
yes , my father keeps this cottage empty just for me ,
so i can stay as far away from him as possible .
the pictures were thrown in by the decorator .
he had a mawkish side .
is this you?
my mother .
she died when i was 12 .
i`m sorry .
and this?
my brother .
he died iast year .
yes ...
i remember .
he had some kind of an accident .
no . he killed himself .
he was diagnosed borderline schizophrenic .
i guess he got tired of the title .
he lived with me on and off .
nice face .
yeah ...
he was pretty nice for a iittle brother .
this is reaily something .
isn`t it?
this is where i used to come to bury my pets .
and this is where i realised that one day i would die .
standing right here on this spot , i realised one day i would be over .
i want to teil you something .
a few days ago , something happened to me .
i was driving in new england and i hit an animal .
a wolf .
in new england?
are you sure?
i`m positive .
when i tried to touch it . it bit me .
did you get checked for rabies?
yes .
i`m fine .
this wiii reaily sound insane .
the wolf passed something on to me .
a scrap of its spirit in my blood .
my senses are suddenly so acute .
i feei just so ... great .
i`m just not the kind of person who walks around feeling great .
i`m more alive .
stronger .
it sounds strange , but ...
it`s better than iiving in bosnia .
no , i wasn`t going to say that .
i was going to say that ...
if you feei great , maybe you should just accept it as a gift .
i`m afraid it wiii have a price .
there is that .
would you iike to stay for dinner?
if not peanut butter and jeily , and i won`t teii my father .
yes .
let`s get back before it`s dark .
are you coid?
no . but we wiii be .
what is it?
here . sit down .
i think ...
i want to get inside .
it`s not that far .
here .
iean on me .
listen , i`m an almost professionai psychiatric nurse .
elevated , but you`ii iive .
is this another attack?
i don`t know .
don`t be upset with me if i teii you this , okay?
you are beautiful .
and the nicest giri ...
can i get you something to eat?
i can`t eat .
then go to sleep .
the next thing you know it`ii be morning and i`ii make coffee .
eggs and toast .
bacon .
you think i can`t get bacon?
i just may surprise you .
i don`t know where i`m going .
someplace nice .
any idea how this happened?
none .
do you ever sleepwalk?
not that i know of .
it sounds iike you took a walk in your sleep and feli down .
there`s some iacerations back here .
nothing bleeds iike the scalp .
i`ii have you in for an eeg and a cat scan .
you`ii have to be in overnight .
impossible .
you could have a concussion .
no one feels this good with a concussion .
so good to see you again so soon . sir .
it`s nice to see you too , wiil .
robert keyes , my counsel .
counseilor , nice to meet you .
sit down .
wiil .
you`re deliberately goading some of our top writers
to become part of some totaily improbable scheme .
and being writers , they`re too damn stupid to know it .
they might not succeed , but it won`t hurt them to try .
and if they fail , any publisher wiii be glad to get them .
it doesn`t matter if we start a new publishing house or go to another .
at ieast seven top writers are going to ieave macleish house .
my press release in the morning wiii see this firm`s reputation coilapse .
you`re worse than stewart .
yes .
taste and individuality .
maybe i can overlook them .
aii right .
caii it off .
keep yourjob .
l`d never have fired you if i`d known you were this ruthless .
i want a deai memo granting me additionai powers and monies .
by tomorrow morning .
i won`t agree to that .
you wiil .
i`d do the same .
i`ii teii stewart .
wait untii the deai is signed .
then i`ii teii stewart .
did you contact miss alden?
not yet .
any appointments?
doctor alezais at 4 .
he`s cailed three times to confirm .
he sounds iike he`s over 100 .
if you want to cancel , you`ii have to do it yourself .
i was just boiling water for tea .
perhaps you wiii join me .
come .
i won`t take much of your time .
take .
i am not a busy man .
you were bitten by a wolf in vermont on march 8th .
very auspicious .
very suspicious?
auspicious .
very auspicious .
march 8th .
the moon was the closest it`s been to earth in 100 years .
weii ... that is auspicious .
what i`m curious about is ...
could my symptoms be caused by chemicals released from a wolf bite?
something that medicai science has overlooked .
among my people there is only one explanation for your symptoms .
that you are becoming a wolf .
but ... you don`t believe that ...
why not?
remember , man has only been out of the jungle for 25, 000 years .
please . sit down .
life is mystical .
it`s just that we are used to it .
catholicism itself .
a religion so mysticai
that even primitive tribes can be converted to it .
the return after death .
judgement day , heaven and heil .
aii so incredible and so ordinary .
but we are used to it .
honey , sugar , sweet n` low?
anything .
honey .
i don`t have honey .
visit a shaman .
he`ii teii you the rules .
i can only teii you the theory .
do you know any of the rules?
very few .
the wolf rests by day and prowls by night .
but he`s always present .
he grows inside a man he`s entered untii the first fuii moon .
then he consumes him .
kiiling aii but his nature and his heart .
not a great prognosis .
of course . not aii who are bitten change .
there must be something wild within .
an analogue of the wolf .
among my people , i`m not known for having an analogue of a wolf .
your people are wrong .
sometimes one doesn`t even need to be bitten .
only the passion of the wolf is enough .
dr. alezais ...
i`d iike to know ...
not that i subscribe to this ...
neither do i.
only to the possibility .
but out of curiosity ...
is there supposed to be any way to stop this metamorphosis?
supposedly there are herbs and rites and amulets .
i don`t know the rites .
i don`t have the herbs .
but i did find something for you when you cailed .
this is one of the most powerfui amulets .
it must be worn next to the skin and never taken off .
if it works . there is said to be great pain and weakness .
the wolf struggles to emerge , and the charm holds him at bay .
i have no idea if any of it is true , but it`s yours .
it`s a gift .
and in return i would iike a favour from you .
if it`s in my power .
i was recently told that i am dying .
speaking of mysticai and terrifying experiences .
i would iike you to bite me .
what?
i would iike you to bite me .
i can`t ask you to transform me with your passions .
but i ask you to honour me with your bite .
i. too . wiii become a demon wolf .
you`d rather be damned than die?
damnation is not a part of my system of beliefs .
the demon wolf is not evii unless the man he`s bitten is evil .
and it feels good to be a wolf , doesn`t it?
power without guilt .
love without doubt .
excuse me , i just can`t .
i understand .
keep the amulet .
if you decide to believe ,
perhaps you wiil give me your gift .
it has been a privilege .
i`ve never seen one iike you .
heilo?
l`ve been trying to call ...
don`t hang up .
let me explain .
i`m not a fan of men who mysteriously disappear .
i had an accident .
i sleepwalked iast night .
i hitmy head .
i drove to the doctor" s at 6 o" clock .
but you didn`t come and teii me?
no , it was 6 o`clock in the morning and i had a scalp wound .
i didn`t want you to take care of me again .
finish drying yourself .
the towel" s driving me crazy .
can you hear that?
yes , it`s one of my new gifts .
laura , please ... can i see you?
can we have dinnertomorrow? .
l" m at the mayflower .
laura?
i`ii be there tomorrow at six .
you`d better iook iike you feil .
i do !
room 825 .
what did you ... ... make me for breakfast?
i`m not only the president of the hair club for men .
i`m also a member .
hold it right there .
put your hands on the cage .
spread your iegs .
he`s clean .
put your hands behind your back .
did you see that?
he got my cuffs .
wait up !
have you got any money?
loan us some money .
aii of you?
yeah ...
i`ve got about $1, 000 in my wailet .
how much would you iike to borrow?
give me the wailet .
morning , this is alice with your8 o" clock wake up .
you musthave been bad lastnight l`ve been ringing you forever .
as a matter of fact .
alice .
i was a very good boy iast night .
i went to bed ...
... so early , i don`t even remember .
big boys here yet?
conference room .
deai in hand .
don`t even pretend to have any doubts .
it`s a pleasure doing business with you , sir .
wiii ...
i talked to mr. alden about your consultant position .
it`s iess pay of course , but so is eastern europe .
thanks . but i`ve had a better offer .
reaily?
what house?
this one .
i don`t understand ...
i did the same thing you did .
i nagged alden untii he gave me yourjob .
when?
i don`t understand .
in my spare time .
i guess i owe you some congratulations .
i guess the best man won .
i`m glad in a way .
i couldn`t have given it up .
and i didn`t iike the way i got it .
i hope we can work together without rancour .
you`re fired .
stewart .
don`t .
wiil .
it`ii ruin me .
i know . but it`s best for the firm .
give me a few months .
let me say i quit .
no .
it wouldn`t be best for the firm .
you vindictive son of a bitch !
the best thing for the firm is me .
i`m the best thing this firm has , and you fucking know it !
are you crazy?
no .
i`m just marking my territory , and you got in the way .
nice .
reai nice .
suede shoes .
asparagus .
wiii ...
please , can i talk to you for a moment?
a moment of your time for 16 years .
that`s pretty cheap .
what do you want?
i want to come back .
i have no excuse .
i deserve anything you do to me .
i`m just begging you to be kind .
has stewart become unlovable now that he`s out of my job?
i never loved stewart .
it was a mistake .
wiil .
i`m going to talk to him .
stewart never for one moment meant anything to me .
and you think that makes it better?
you betrayed me with a man
that meant nothing to you?
you betrayed me for nothing .
don`t be so smug .
don`t touch me .
keep away .
hi , i thought i`d just come on up .
have you been waiting for me?
i can`t see you .
open the door .
you can`t do this to me twice .
open it !
i wonder if you could do me a favour ...
please go .
why?
what happened?
what have you done?
where did you get those?
i want you to go .
no .
teii me why you`ve done this .
it`s getting iate .
i think i`m dangerous , especiaily at night .
you`re afraid that when it gets dark , you`ii attack me?
yeah .
i think i`m turning into ... something else .
into the thing that bit you?
into the wolf?
teli me where the key is .
i don`t have a key .
i don`t even know where i got the handcuffs .
you don`t have a key?
what was your plan?
to sit chained to the radiator untii you grew paws?
god ... you almost make this seem iike it isn`t happening .
i don`t have a plan .
i didn`t think past not hurting anyone .
i don`t think i can open these .
you don`t know about me .
when you`re a druggie and a delinquent ,
and you want to get daddy , you get arrested .
you come into contact with the criminai element of society .
you pick up shit you think you`re never going to need .
then one day you meet a guy who chains himself to the radiator .
why do you want any of this nightmare?
you mean instead of the gaiety of my normal iife?
i don`t know .
because i iike you .
because you`re a good man .
and that`s very exotic to me .
i never thought i`d meet a good man who iooked at me the way you do .
you don`t know i`m a good man .
yes .
i do .
then why is this happening?
i thought only the evii were cursed .
no . not at ail .
i could`ve told you that .
the worst things happen to the best people .
i almost had it .
you might consider
that you`re not cursed at ail , that you`re sick .
there are brain tumours that can cause aii of your symptoms .
tumours?
what are you saying?
are you serious?
yeah .
god , if only that could be true .
how we iower our sights .
i say we get you examined for physicai causes ,
before we take for granted that you`re becoming ...
there we go .
on your feet .
let`s get you re handcuffed .
maybe it isn`t necessary .
hands behind your back .
there .
you seem pretty helpiess now .
yes .
great .
interesting .
what is it?
it`s a good iuck charm .
reaily?
does it work?
weil . today isn`t turning out too bad .
laura ...
yes?
nothing ... not a thing .
who is it?
police .
detective sergeant bridger , nypd .
is wiiliam randaii here?
why?
what`s wrong?
i`d rather teii mr. randail .
he`s in the shower .
ls it okay if i come in and wait?
there`s ... some kind of a problem .
i understand .
i`m wiii randail .
i`m renting the apartment .
about the noise iast night ...
he`s not the hotei manager .
he`s a police detective .
could we talk in private?
that won`t be necessary .
this is miss smith , my fiancee .
she can hear anything that you have to say .
your wife was found dead this morning .
i`m sorry .
she was murdered iast night .
her body was found in the park .
how was she killed?
her throat was torn out .
sit down .
no ...
i want to stand up .
would you mind teiling me when you saw your wife iast?
last night , here in the iobby .
about six .
did you argue?
don`t answer anything else , will .
i`m trying to get the facts .
the clerk said mr. randaii and his wife had argued .
so you already know they argued .
these are not straight questions .
could i ask about mr. randail`s whereabouts iast night?
mr. randaii was with me iast night .
i arrived at 6 : 30 and didn`t ieave .
check that with the desk .
i wiil .
we`ve taken some blood and tissue samples from your ... the victim .
it would reaily help if you would submit some samples ...
not without a court order .
just a request .
here`s my number .
in case you want to reach me .
i`d iike you to come down to the station and give a statement .
both of you .
aii right .
thank you for your cooperation .
he`s got an alibi .
the giri says she was with him .
airtight?
it depends on who the giri is .
charlotte randall was wife of the senioreditorofmacleish house ,
recentlypurchased by raymondalden .
police have no suspects in custody at this time .
my god !
i hope they don`t go after wiil .
why should they?
he`s the husband and they were separated .
it wouldn`t be great for the stock .
it could be a bonanza for the stock .
the heat , the gossip .
that`s what publishing`s about .
weil , you handle it .
you`re back in marketing .
thank you , sir .
if they do go after wiil ,
and i hope that they don`t , i`d iike to bid again for the job .
randaii has the right to name his own replacement .
he`s named roy macailister .
i see .
would that contract hold if wiii was arrested?
yes . unless he`s convicted .
you`ii have to keep your fingers crossed .
i didn`t mean ...
reaily?
what did you mean?
i hope to god wiii is innocent .
and if he is . screw the job .
but if he`s guilty ... screw roy macailister .
it`s not much farther now .
what if i kiiled her?
what if you kiiled her?
are you the guy i spent the night with?
you iook so much iike him .
i could have gone out after you feii asleep .
why does it always have to be the worst news?
the worst pain?
the worst defeat?
because ... what if it is?
it`s not !
it`s not .
they`ve ieft the hotel .
the night clerk identified the girl .
she`s laura alden .
howw`s that for an alibi?
where are we?
we`re almost home .
jesus !
where did the day go?
you`d better duck down .
hi .
miss alden .
hi , george .
stay down .
hi .
tom .
be carefui of the woods .
there are some wild dogs .
what do you mean?
we found a deer they kiiled .
thanks .
i`ii be careful .
goodnight .
i want you to lock me up before it gets dark .
then what?
then maybe it won`t happen .
i don`t know where else to put you but the barn .
everything else has windows .
the barn sounds good .
the barn sounds great .
i`m gonna beat this , laura .
i`m gonna beat this .
your phone is ringing .

i can hear it .
i`ii be right back .
heilo?
laura alden?
this is detective bridger .

and we now know who you are .
how iong have you been ringing?
about two minutes . but i`ve been trying to reach you aii day .
tomorrow you`ii give me the statement i asked for .
ali right .
do you stiii want blood and tissue samples from mr. randall?
they`d be useless .
we`ve messed up the samples we took from the body .
what happened?
there was canine dna in aii the tissue samples .
the victim could have been mauled aftershe was killed .
ormaybe one ofthe lab assistants had been petting herdog .
you scared me .
you were right .
the phone was ringing .
it was that detective .
bridger .
he traced me and now he`s threatening to subpoena me
if i don`t give him a statement tonight .
wiii you be aii right if i go in?
yes .
don`t iook so scared .
maybe there`s happy endings even for people who don`t believe in them .
i want you to know something .
i`ve never loved anybody this way .
if the world ends .
i`ii stiii understand what god meant
if i`m with her .
laura alden`s coming in tonight .
it sounds iike she`s been crying .
i just got a caii from randail`s best friend .
he wants to see me tonight .
we`ve got a busy night .
the the family of a kid who got his fingers torn off is out there .
what is there about a fuii moon?
more iight .
if a rich , white boy had his fingers torn off , they`d do something .
laura alden for mr. bridger .
he`s running behind .
miss alden , take my seat .
no .
please .
no .
i want to stand .
you don`t know me .
stewart swinton .
i`m a friend of wiii randail`s .
i know who he is ...
weil .
i know his name .
this is a terrible thing .
i`m in shock over it .
wiii was more than a friend . he was my mentor .
and you were his protege?
yes . a better word . it`s a true pleasure .
a very interesting scent you have .
at once new . and familiar .
very familiar .
thank you .
were you bitten?
what?
what a very odd question .
what made you ask such a question?
i don`t know ...
when people are bitten . it`s often on the hand .
why are you here?
they want some information about the publishing house .
stewart swinton !
come on in .
wiii you have a drink with me?
i`ii teii you aii about wiil .
thank you , that`s very sweet .
i`d love to .
wonderful .
don`t break our date now .
i won`t .
this is not easy .
wiii randail was a very dear friend of mine .
i`m not proud of what i`m going to say .
charlotte randaii and i ...
this is hard .
charlotte randaii and i were having an affair .
it just happened .
and wiii found out .
yes .
will there be anyone else?
there wiii only be the two of us .
i`ii be flying with a sick friend .
could you please have it as near the gate as possible?
in about an hour .
he was iike a madman .
he was a madman .
he bit me .
he urinated on my shoe .
urinated ...
he told me he would kiii her .
i didn`t believe him .
i blame myself .
if you`re gonna hang a first degree murder rap on wiil , forget it .
this was true temporary insanity .
if wiii is arrested .
i`ii testify to that in his defence .
i understand .
he`s staying at the alden place with miss alden . isn`t he?
i reaily must find him .
ask her .
she`s outside .
laura alden?
she`s gone .
she ieft right after mr. swinton went in .
we don`t need her .
get a warrant for randail .
did he say ``on his shoe`` or ``in his shoe``?
no one gets through without a cail !
no one !
the horses were restless tonight .
it`s ali right .
steer clear of the barn tonight .
wiii you teii the others?
yes . ma`am .
can i help you?
mr. swinton ...
i`m here to see miss alden .
i`m afraid i`ii have to cail .
may i ask your business?
pleasure .
she`d be the fuck of the decade .
back up .
aii right .
excuse me !
can i help you?
i`m here to see miss alden .
you`re not expected .
reaily?
i have a card ... ... and an appointment .
here .
heilo .
miss alden .
if you scream , i`il kiii you .
i`ii just break your neck , okay?
this is a surprise .
how did you get in?
i smooth talked the guard .
if anyone could do it ...
don`t play any more games .
you know , don`t you?
what?
what`s happening to me .
you`re playing games with me .
you pretended not to know wiil .
you know what happened to charlotte .
aii right , i do know wiii and i do know what`s happening to you .
wiii told me . when i asked him if there were any more iike him .
i`m not a fool .
laura .
i know that .
if you find me so attractive , how about me fucking you right now?
how would that be?
i`d have to try it first .
heilo .
wiil .
locked you up , did she?
is my daughter ail right?
i thought she was with you .
laura !
i heard gunshots .
i was afraid to come out .
are you with randail?
where`s randail?
as far as i know , he`s on his way to teterboro airport .
i told him i wasn`t going with him .
he hung up on me .
we`d iike to check the cottage .
what`s happening?
they think tom shot swinton .
laura .
tom is dead .
george , too , he was run down .
with stewart swinton`s car .
he was after wiil .
at the police station , he kept asking where wiii was .
laura alden chartered a plane .
swinton was iooking for randail .
he asked us if randaii was here .
when he found out that laura alden was gone , he took off .
aii this might not have happened ,  but i was against randail , because he was after my daughter .
you were just trying to save me from a disastrous relationship .
it would only have iasted a week .
he was too tame for me .
that`s what i thought when i saw you together at the mayflower .
i hope this time you wiii give us a statement .
it would be my pleasure .
could i get you something to drink , detective?
another vodka tonic?
another ... no . thanks .
let me know if you change your mind .
how did she know i`d been drinking?
i can smeii it .
i can smeii it a mile away .
