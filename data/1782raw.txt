but loses his soul?
for what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
baht?
baht .
you're making a terrible mistake .
i can get you anything you want .
american chocolate , whiskey , american cig ...
how about a watch?
the major imagined reardon a threat .
to him , a man without a sense of duty ,
loyal to no one but himself ,
is already a traitor .
shit .
no , please .
please .
it's my school .
it's my school !
major campbell struck a deal with thejaps .
i was to be left alone .
in his mind , this was not considered betrayal .
the school had delayed his plans .
men were changing their minds .
and dusty had been the catalyst .
this book ... teaches to turn the other cheek .
we read these books , and we become better slaves for the emperor .
he says the book is superstition .
captain noguchi says the railroad progress is too slow .
he received orders from headquarters ... requiring us to finish six months earlier than it was scheduled .
honorable sir , that's ...
you are dismissed .
superstition .

i am that yankee doodle boy??
i'm still alive , you jap bastards !
you can understand that , can't you?
they could take away our books and classes , but we were determined they couldn't take away what we had learned in our university .
dusty led some of the men out of the death house to help draw water .
his example of what we were learning inspired us to work like never before .
and our captors noticed .
as for the major , we refused to get even with him ... to pay him back in kind .
and it began to eat at him .
captain noguchi says he gives you your books back ... for you to keep learning .
captain noguchi graciously gives you these gifts ... for being good workers .
what is it?
we're back in business , lads !
oi , these are three years old .
japanese import laws .
there's mail in here !
oh , let's see it .
from that day on , yanker never spoke much .
something had changed inside him .
it was hard to tell whether it was for the better ... or the worse .
chip , chip , muckers .
graduation ceremonies are coming .
i want a tip top performance out of you .
continue .??
gentlemen ,
let's continue .
if we are marked to die , we are enough to do our country loss .
and if to live , the fewer men , the greater share ofhonor .
he that shall live and see old age , then shall he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say ,
these wounds i had on crispian's day .
old men forget , yet all shall be forgot .
meat !
meat !
beef !
yanker decided tojoin us ... a bit late in the term , but eager to catch up .
you're a good teacher .
what's your name?
i'm nagase .
takashi nagase .
hello , takashi .
i'm ernest .
i've actually been wonderin '... where you learned such excellent english .
i was educated at cambridge .
to be a good translator ,
i thought one must understand the culture .
so what do you think of the british?
i think there is a lot to learn from them .
can i ask you , honorable takashi , what are you doing here in this camp?
uh , i was classified low physical fitness .
prisoner of war camp is not honorable place forjapanese soldier .
it is more like punishment .
shame for his entire family .
well , what about ...
sergeant ito?
surely he's the consummate soldier .
he accepted the blame for the bad decision that his superior made .
it resulted in the deaths of most of his squad .
right .
so that's why he's so bitter .
no .
in bushido , it is an honor to be punished in place of your superior .
according to our imperial rescript , in the emperor's army , a single life weighs less than a feather .
no matter how good things got , we were still slaves building a railway , being starved to death .
thousands of us in a dozen other prison camps as well .
and as if that weren't enough , the major and his dangerous plan seemed ready to explode at any moment .
it was a sobering thought when we realized ... we weren't the only slaves being used in the name of the emperor .
they called them " comfort women ... '" spoils ofjapanese conquest .
a conquest whose original intent was to purify the spirit ... where the true warrior deems his sword the soul of bushido ... the key ofheaven and hell .
a symbol of what he carries in his heart ...
loyalty and honor .
we finished the railroad in october of 1943 , six months ahead of schedule .
a real cause for celebration .
like we were told in the very beginning , they built it over the white man's body .
these damned yellow mongoloid nips .
actin'as if they built the bloody thing .
bloody railway of death .
that's the least of our concerns .
what do you mean?
we've built the railway .
don't need us anymore .
those of you to the right of me will be immediately transferred ... to another camp .
it seemed like the final hindrance to the major's plan .
half ofhis men were split apart that day .
sent away , never seen again .
attention , all prisoners ,
there is a shovel missing from a toolshed .
the one who has taken the shovel , return it now .
if the shovel is not returned , the entire company will suffer punishment .
you will respect us .
the shovel was found .
there was a miscount ... a simple , bloody miscount .
you are dismissed .
what would compel a man , one so selfish , to sacrifice himself for others?
boys , i can't feel my legs .
i can't feel my legs .
tonight's the graduation ceremony .
japs have all been invited .
that means a slim to zero chance of anyone being left in the guardhouse .
major , you're not still planning on going through with this?
there's only six of us .
we lost six men .
i thought it was near impossible with 12 .
god in heaven knows , we haven't got a chance with six .
so now you're privy to the mind of god in heaven?
no , but ...
i will not tolerate double mindedness .
i'm stayin '.
well , that leaves five .
don't worry , boys .
you don't worry , boys .
we'll have our justice .
??
major charlie fraser , language .
sergeant bingojohnson , philosophy .
and last , but by no means least ,
private wallace hamilton , ethics .
gentlemen , the graduates ... from our jungle university .
??
well , let the festivities begin .
??
the music we heard that night was less than perfect .
in fact , it was bloody terrible .
but we didn't care .
in our hearts we heard what it could be .
we heard the true spirit of the music , and that was pure freedom .??
if we are mark'd to die , we are enough to do our country loss .
go on .
do it .
guard .
down .
down .
come on .
come on now .
glad you could make it .
well , the music was bloody awful .
he that shall see this day and live old age ... shall stand at tiptoe when this day is named .
then shall he strip his sleeve and show his scars , and say ...
there's no ammo in this thing .
find it !
old men forget , yet all shall be forgot .
shh , shh , shh .
it's a b 24 .
it's liberators .
how can you be sure?
it's unmistakable , man .
sweet music , man .
it's liberators !
allied aircraft .
they couldn't see us , but we could sure hear them .
and we knew that the war was turning .
speedo , speedo .
speedo , me arse !
attention , prisoners .
these men are guilty of murdering two guards ... who represent the imperial army ...
give us this day our daily ...
and of conspiracy to commit insurrection .
they have violated the mercy of the emperor and his benevolent subjects .
such bad spirit must be punished .
honorable sergeant ito will now dispense with the prescribed andjust punishment .
major?
amen .
cor !
bastard .
ito .
dusty !
what are you saying?
what are you saying?
dusty?
no .
no .
no .
no .
no !
dusty !
my boy .
major?
major , what did he say?
major , please , what did dusty say?
major !
my boys .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
no , no .
no .
no !
no !
no !
superstition .
do it .
dusty . !
dusty !
dusty !
when dusty miller died , something in the hearts ... and minds of every man died with him .
what we had somehow managed to hold onto for years of survival ... now seemed utterly meaningless ,
like god himself was playing a cruel joke on us all , until i remembered dusty's words so very long ago .
except a corn of wheat to fall into the ground and die ,
it abideth alone .
but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . '
i never found out what dusty said to ito that day , but i knew i had witnessed the power of forgiveness .
attention .
soon , all inferior races will bow ... before the majesty of the emperor and the knights of the bushido .
when we heard the planes again , we thought our deliverance had finally arrived .
and then it happened .
hail knights of" bullshito !
our own allies thought we were the enemy .
give me a hand !
go on !
i'm fine !
help the other men !
hurry !
help me !
help me , ernie !
just don't look at it , man .
don't look at it !
they thought we was nips , ernie .
i almost made it .
i got killed by my own side , ernie !
you're not killed .
you're with me , man .
they thought we was nips !
shh , shh .
don't leave me , man .
don't you leave me , man !
don't you leave me , man .
don't leave me , man .
stay with me , man .
stay with me , man !
stay with me , man !
no !
get up . !
get fuckin'up . !
an enemy location was also hit nearby .
the wounded had abandoned their posts looking for help .
their arrival at our camp would compel us to make ... the most important decision of our lives ... a decision that would defy the bushido code ... ofhonor and shame .
no good .
no good .
ernest?
captain gordon , i forbid you to give comfort and aid to the enemy .
major , those ... are wounded , dying human beings .
they're no harm to us .
ernie , get back to your own men .
could someone please get me some water?
could someone please get me some water?
??
??
??
we were left alone by our captors .
nowhere to go .
nothing to do .
an uncertain future , with only a makeshift radio left behind , hoping for any word from the outside .
to all allied prisoners of war .
thejapanese forces have surrendered unconditionally , and the war is over . '"??
for he today that sheds his blood with me ... shall be my brother .
be he ne'er so vile , this day shall gentle his condition ,
from this day to the ending of the world .
but we in it shall be remembered , we few , we happy few , we band of brothers .
??
??
where are the guards?
they ...
they left .
fled into the jungle ... from us .
which direction?
i have no idea .
you're a man of true principle and devotion .
and you know ,
i wanna be just like you ... just like you .
major campbell?
ernie .
you're just in time .
you're making a mistake .
no .
i'm makin'justice , man .
makin'justice .
don't you think i want this?
eh?
eh?
we all deserve to see him suffer , but this is not right .
hmm?
hmm?
aye .
fuck !
you stupid ... stupid wee boy .
stupid wee boy .
god forgive me .
oh , god , forgive me .
oh , god .
forgive me , son .
forgive me , son .
no !
what is the consequence of a single life weighing less than a feather?
bastard !
bastard !
what is the final destination ofhatred?
when you look in the eyes of the enemy ... and you see yourself ,
come here .
at what price mercy?
who is my neighbor?
how many times shall i forgive my brother?
what does it mean to love one's enemies?
what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
these are the questions that i faced in my prison camp .
the answers ... changed my life forever .??
