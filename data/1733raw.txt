the young girl ... sat perfectly still in the confessional ...
iistening to her father's boots scrape like chalk ... on the ancient steps of the church ... then grow faint , then disappear altogether .
she could sense the priest beyond the grate
on that particular friday afternoon ...
iast february ...
i was reading a story to my advanced writer's workshop ... by one james leer , junior lit major ... and sole inhabitant of his own gloomy gulag .
she bit the flesh of her lip ... closed her eyes , mute .
james 'stories were about as sunny as his disposition .
i was distracted .
maybe it had something to do with the fact ... that my wife had left me that morning .
so .
anyone?
maybe not .
wives had left me before .
carrie .
as usual , james 'classmates ... aware of a writer's inherent vulnerability ... offered their sensitive , gentle opinions .
i mean , jesus , what is it with you catholics?
all right .
all right .
let's try to be constructive here , shall we?
howard , what about you?
i hated it .
his stories make me want to kill myself .
that's not exactly what i meant by being constructive , howard .
yes , hannah?
i think maybe we're missing the point .
hannah green .
a talented writer who rented a room in my house .
i knew her to be insightful , kind ... and compulsively clad in red cowboy boots .
i had , in fact , never once seen her without them .
he respects us enough to forget us , and ... that takes courage .
well put , hannah .
and a good note to end on , i think .
oh , don 't forget about wordfest this weekend .
and those of you who are driving v. i. p. s ... to the cocktail party this evening ... should have them at the chancellor's house ... no later than 5 : 30 .
thank you for that .
is he all right?
i think so .
how about you?
me?
yeah .
why?
just checking .
turn off the light , please .
it felt good to be in the car .
alone .
where i could clear my head .
tonight was the opening of wordfest ... the university's annual three day " gabathon " ... for writers and wanna bes .
my editor , terry crabtree , was flying in for the event .
he alone had championed my last novel , arsonist's daughter ... and its critical success had put us both on the map .
but that was seven years ago ... and i still hadn't finished my follow up .
i knew terry didn't give a rat's ass about wordfest .
he was coming to town to get a look at my long overdue book .
i had to keep him at bay .
ah , tripp .
crabtree , how are you , my friend?
it's good to see you , tripp .
let me help you with this .
say hello to my new friend .
miss antonia  sloviak .
nice to meet you .
this way .
i took the liberty of inviting antonia to tonight's festivities .
the more the merrier .
terry was telling me about you on the plane .
it was all so interesting .
i was just explaining how a book comes to be published ... what you do as a writer , what i do as an editor .
i sweat blood for five years , and he corrects my spelling .
that's exactly what he said .
we know each other pretty well .
and actually , it's seven years .
you know how many times i've board ed an airplane just praying ... that some gal like her would be sitting down beside me?
she's a transvestite .
you're stoned .
she's still a transvestite .
so , how's the book?
uh , it's fine .
it's done .
basically .
i got a little tinkering i've still got to do .
great !
i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime over the weekend .
it's gonna be a little tough .
i'm at a critical juncture right now .
i thought you were just tinkering .
w well , i am , but i have little details i've got to work on .
i'm not gonna pressure you .
i just got off the plane .
i mean , i get pressure .
you know?
i get
know what i mean?
what the hell in the hootenanny do you suppose that would be?
that would be a tuba .
you didn't actually purchase this car , did you?
no , i got it from jerry nathan .
he owed me some money .
ah !
he owes god money .
including my commission on that faux novel of his .
that perfume you're wearing , antonia ... that wouldn't happen to be cristalle , would it?
um , uh , yes , it is .
how did you know?
lucky guess .
the wordfest kickoff party ... was always held at sara and walter gaskell's house .
she was the chancellor , which meant she oversaw the university .
her husband , dr. gaskell ... was the chairman of the english department ... which meant he oversaw me .
isn't that a nice greenhouse?
it's mrs. gaskell's .
it's her hobby .
i thought you were mrs. gaskell's hobby .
piss off , will you , crabs?
i lost a wife today .
you'll find another .
she'll be young , beautiful .
they always are .
oh , hello , everyone .
terry , good to see you again .
chancellor .
don't you look ravishing .
oh , oh .
easy .
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
it's these goddamn shoes .
i don't know how anyone can walk in these things .
practice .
i don't believe we've met .
antonia sloviak .
poe .
poe !
poe !
poe , stop !
poe !
that wouldn't be walter's dog , would it?
poe !
who's he barking at now?
he 's still barking at me .
he 's blind .
stop this .
honestly .
excuse me , i need to talk to you for a second , chancellor .
i need to talk to you too .
maybe you could help me take these coats to the upstairs guest room .
i'd be happy to if i knew where the upstairs guest room was .
i could show you .
terry .
yeah .
oh , yeah .
we'll make ourselves at home .
we'll let poe show us around .
thanks .
that's new , isn't it?
yeah , walter just got it back from the framer .
you first .
this morning  i'm pregnant .
i'm sure .
well , that's that's very surprising .
does walter know that , uh
i think walter would find this a little more than surprising .
emily left me this morning .
she's left before .
she's left the room before , but she's always come back .
so .
i guess we just divorce our spouses , marry each other ... and have this baby , right?
simple .
yeah , right .
simple .
is that cristalle?
mm hmm .
oh , god .
i wear the same scent as a transvestite .
she is a transvestite , isn't she?
if she's not now , terry'll make sure she is ... by the end of the evening .
has he asked you about the book yet?
yes .
and?
are you gonna tell him?
no .
maybe .
i don't know what i'm gonna do .
me either .
dimaggio 's record ... for hits in consecutive games ... is probably the most impressive feat in all of sports ... and in my opinion , will never be broken .
come here , big guy .
his condition's so sad .
yes , but even blind , he still gets around .
i don't drink normally ... but this was turning out to be one fucked up day .
and now i found myself in close proximity to sara 's husband ... and his dog , poe .
walter , i see you've met my friend .
oh , yes .
she's charming .
despite his much vaunted harvard education ...
dr. walter gaskell didn't have a clue about his wife and me .
simply put , di maggio represented metaphorically speaking , of course the husband as slugger .
poe had been on to me since day one .
in fact , i personally believe ... that every woman in some way desires to be marilyn monroe .
oh , i couldn't agree more .
i've had a lot of successes over the years .
q. q was rich .
q was famous .
q completed a novel every 18 months .
i hated him . ... finest work vanished in less than five .
so i find myself conflicted .
ask him if he's conflicted about his house in the hamptons .
grady .
well , professor .
q. for your information ...
hannah already has two stories published ... in the paris review , so you better dust off your " a " material .
you didn't tell me you were a writer .
you didn't ask .
how did you feel about the adaptation?
i thought it was more literary than cinematic .
grady .
douglas triddley , amherst .
i've had arsonist 's daughter ... on my graduate studies syilabus three years running .
no wonder it's still in print .
long time since arsonist's daughter .
there you are .
i could have sworn i had a bottle of 1975 lafite rothschild for q.
given that he's going to be addressing 500 people ... in less than an hour
you want to keep q happy .
if he's happy , i'm happy .
james?
it's fake .
it was my mother's .
she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore ... when she went to catholic school .
well , that's very convincing .
i used to shoot these little paper caps ... but they don't make them anymore , the caps .
it's just for good luck , you know?
some people carry rabbit's feet .
you carry firearms .
no , thank you .
i don't like to lose control of my emotions .
i'm not supposed to be here , in case you're wondering .
but the other night i was out with hannah at the movies ... and she asked me since she was coming , so i ended up coming too .
you and , uh , hannah , you're seeing each other?
no !
what gave you that idea?
james , relax .
i'm not her father .
i just rent her a room .
she likes old movies like i do , that's all .
what's the movie you guys saw?
son of fury ... with tyrone power and frances farmer .
she went crazy , frances farmer .
so did gene tierney .
she's in it too .
sounds like a good one .
it wasn't bad .
you're not like my other teachers , prof. tripp .
you're not like my other students , james .
look , james ... about this afternoon in workshop , i'm sorry .
i think i let things get a little out of hand .
they really hated it .
i think they hated it more than any of the other ones .
well  doesn't matter .
it only took me an hour to write .
really?
that's remarkable .
i have trouble sleeping .
while i'm lying in bed , i figure them out , the stories .
you cold , james?
oh , a little .
why don 't we go inside?
it's colder in there .
i guess you're right .
actually , i saw the greenhouse .
i thought i'd come outside and take a look at it .
it looks like heaven .
looks like heaven?
i saw a movie once .
part of it took place in heaven .
everyone wore white .
lived in crystal houses like that .
i really should be going .
good bye , prof. tripp .
hey , james .
james , don't go .
no .
there's something i want you to see .
i'll miss my bus .
it's worth it .
trust me .
let me help you with that .
thank you , dear .
thank you .
come on .
hey , you two .
james , are you riding with me?
no , i'm going home  no , he's going with me .
why don't you take crabtree and his friend?
all right?
all right .
where are they anyway?
here we are .
hmm .
well , hello there .
james , this is my editor , terry crabtree .
james .
james'll know about george sanders .
george sanders?
mr. crabtree was saying ... how george sanders killed himself , only he couldn't remember how .
pills .
april 25 , 1 972 , in a costa brava hotel room .
how comprehensive of you .
james is amazing .
he knows all the movie suicides .
go ahead , james .
tell him .
there are so many .
well , just a few .
the big ones .
pier angeli , 1971 or '72 , also pills .
donald " red " barry , shot himself in 1 980 .
charles boyer , 1978 , pills again .
charles butterworth , 1946 , i think .
in a car .
supposedly , it was an accident , but , you know , he was distraught .
dorothy dandridge , pills , 1965 .
albert dekker , 1968 .
he hung himself .
he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach .
william lnge , carbon monoxide , 1973 .
carole landis , pills again .
i forget when .
george reeves , " superman " on tv , shot himself .
jean seberg , pills , of course , 1 979 .
everett sloane he was good pills .
margaret sulla van , pills .
lupe velez , a lot of pills .
gig young , he shot himself and his wife in 1 978 .
there are tons more .
i haven't heard of half of them .
you did them alphabetically .
it's just how my bra in works , i guess .
fascinating .
come out with us after the lecture .
there's this place i always get tripp to take me .
actually , i just want to go home .
don 't be silly .
no one your age just wants to go home .
besides , faculty will be present .
just consider it a field trip .
ls that really it?
that's really it .
the one she wore on her wedding day .
so i'm told .
go ahead .
really?
really .
she was small .
most people don't know that .
the shoulders are so small .
it looks so perfect .
i bet it's the only time she wore it .
that day .
she must have felt so happy .
must've cost dr. gaskell a lot .
i guess .
he also never tells sara the truth ... about how much he pays for these things .
you're really good friends with the chancellor , aren't you?
pretty good .
i'm friends with her husband too .
i guess you must be if you know the combination to his closet ... and he doesn't mind you being in here in their bedroom .
right .
drive carefully .
stick close to me in case it gets slippery .
we better skedaddle .
james [ sniffling ]
you all right , james?
oh .
i'm sorry , prof. tripp .
maybe it's ... seeing that jacket that belonged to her .
it just looks really lonely ... hanging there in a closet .
maybe i'm just a little sad tonight .
i'm a little sad tonight too , james .
you mean , with your wife leaving you and all?
hannah mentioned something about it .
yeah , well , it's complicated , james .
i think we should go now .
easy , easy .
he's a good boy , poe .
poe's a good boy .
easy , poe .
easy .
good dog .
jesus christ !
get off !
shit , james .
you shot dr. gaskell's dog .
but l i had to , didn't l?
you could've pulled him off me .
no , the dog was crazy , prof. tripp .
the dog was attacking you !
calm down , james .
don't freak out , all right?
okay .
all right .
do you have a mirror?
it's the best way to see if someone's still breathing .
the dog is dead , james .
believe me .
i know a dead dog when i see one .
oh , shit .
what are we supposed to do now?
first , you're gonna give me that little cap gun of yours .
come on .
prof. tripp , what are we gonna do with ... it?
i don't know .
i'm still trying to figure out ... how to tell the chancellor that i murdered her husband's dog .
you?
trust me , james .
when the family pet's been assassinated ... the owner does not want to hear ... that one of her students was the triggerman .
does she wanna hear it was one of her professors?
i've got tenure .
hang on .
it's still warm .
let's try feet first .
yuck !
that is a big trunk .
it holds a tuba , a suitcase ... a dead dog and a garment bag almost perfectly .
yep .
that's just what they used to say in the ads .
come on , crabtree .
i know you're holding .
whose tuba is that anyway?
miss sloviak's .
can i ask you something about her?
yes , she is .
so is your friend crabtree
is he is he gay?
most of the time he is , james .
some of the time he isn't .
what do we have here?
this looks like
that's our old friend mr. codeine .
that should take the old pinch out of the ankle .
you want one?
no , thanks .
i'm fine without them .
right .
that's why you were standing in the chancellor's backyard ... spinning that cap gun of yours .
you're fine .
yeah , you're just as fit as a fucking fiddle .
i'm sorry , james .
i'm sorry i said that .
how about we try that again?
it is a great pleasure to introduce ... best selling author quentin morewood ... known to his friends simply as q.
i ... am a writer .
as a writer , you learn that everyone you meet has a story .
every bartender , every taxi driver ... has an idea that would make a great book .
presumably each of you has an idea .
but how do you get from there to here?
what is the bridge from the water's edge of inspiration ... to the far shore of accomplishment?
faith .
faith that your story is worth the telling .
faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it .
and faith that the carefully woven structure that you create ... won 't collapse beneath you .
and faith that when you get to the other side ... there will be someone waiting ... who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell .
i'll be back in a minute .
like whitman , i admit ...
i worship at the shrine of formal construction .
but like conrad , i confess that i have a secret sharer in my work .
my double , my other self .
i am haunted by this malignant , remorseless shadow
grady .
grady .
you had another one again , didn't you?
is the thing
is it over?
almost .
wanna sit up?
what's wrong?
nothing , i just twisted
sara , there's something i've gotta tell you .
something hard .
stand up then .
i'm too old for all this rolling around on the floor .
give me a hand?
well , this evening  don't .
i know what you're gonna say .
i don't think you do know what i'm gonna say , sara .
you love emily .
of course you love emily .
she's young , beautiful .
she's your wife .
you have to stay with her .
b but i don't have a choice .
emily left me .
she'll come back .
that's why i'm going to [ softly ]
to not have this baby .
you're not gonna have it?
no , there's no way .
i mean , don't you think there's no way?
well , i don't see any , but i know what it means to you .
no , you don't .
and fuck you for saying you do , for saying that there's no way .
because there could be a way , grady .
they must be finishing .
we should go .
whose gun is that?
a souvenir from baltimore .
it's heavy .
smells like [ sniffing ]
gunpowder .
caps .
pow .
you got me .
i love you , grady .
the doors made so much noise .
it was so embarrassing .
they had to carry him out .
is he all right?
he's fine .
he's narrating .
they were going to the men's room ... but would they make it in time?
terry crabtree and james leer .
leave it to you to make that mistake .
wait here .
i need a ride .
i'm your man .
there's an explanation .
couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
antonia , listen  tony .
now that i'm home .
tony ...
i'm sorry tonight didn't work out the way you'd hoped to with terry .
forget it .
your friend is just ...
i don't know , into collecting weird tricks .
i think he'd call it a habit .
i do get the feeling he's going through the motions a little bit .
you mean because his career is ruined and all?
is that what he told you?
he said he hasn't had a success in over five years , and ... everyone in new york thinks he's kind of a loser .
but he said he's sure your book's so good that ... he'll be able to keep his job .
and you're not one of those writers who has a success and then ... freezes up and never has another one .
you can turn here .
gotta go .
i think i may have to rescue james leer .
you know , grady , maybe ... you should think about going home .
you look like you need a little rescuing yourself .
@@ [ r& b ]
hey , grady .
how are you?
can i get a double dickel on the rocks , please?
i'm right over here .
double dickel .
is that just beer?
primarily .
although i gather that the two of you staged a little raid ... on the crabtree pharmacopoeia .
so where is everybody?
sara and walter declined .
i guess they just wanted ... to go home and curl up on the couch with poe .
jesus , he's out .
he has a book .
i know .
he started it in fall semester .
finished it winter break .
so is he any good?
no , not yet he isn't .
well , i'm gonna read it anyway .
oh , crabs , come on , will ya?
he's one of my students , for christ's sakes .
besides , i'm not sure if he's , uh  he is .
i'm sure .
take my word for it .
i see myself in him .
i'm sure you do , but it's a little more complicated than that .
besides , he's a little scattered right now .
he almost did something really stupid tonight .
i don't think he needs sexual confusion ... to mix up the stew a little more .
on the contrary , i think it might be just the ticket .
double dickel on the rocks .
oola "?
thanks , oola .
cheers .
cheers .
oh , my goodness .
do you see what i see?
look there .
let 's go .
you first .
president of the james brown hair club for men .
he's a boxer .
a flyweight .
no , no , he's a jockey .
his name is curtis hard apple .
not curtis .
okay then , vernon .
vernon hardapple .
the scars are from a horse .
he fell during a race .
he got trampled .
he's addicted to painkillers .
he can't even piss standing up anymore .
lives with his mother .
that's right .
and he's got a younger brother who's a
who's a groom named claudelle .
yeah .
his mother blames vernon for claudelle 's death .
great !
because because
because  because why?
he was killed when a gangster named freddy nostrils ... tried to shoot his favorite horse .
claudelle took the bullet himself .
vernon , over there ... was in on the hit .
that was good .
yeah , he heard everything we said .
come on , teach .
i want you to dance with me .
no .
come on .
so i've been rereading arsonist's daughter .
it's so beautiful , grady .
it's so natural .
it's like all of your sentences always existed , just ... waiting for up there in style heaven for you to fetch them down .
i thank you .
and i love the inscription you wrote to me .
only i'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am .
i hope that's not true .
we need all the downy innocents we can get .
@ and it 's time to go @ @ i need your love so bad @@
what this boy could use is a nice , tall coca cola .
let me help .
no , we got him .
i'll meet you two at the car .
oh , i see .
all right .
well , give me the keys to the trunk .
i gotta get my property out of there .
the trunk's a little sticky , crabs .
i gotta do it .
whatever .
professor ...
tripp .
hannah , when you get james back to his apartment ... make sure he's all right before you leave , okay?
i would if i knew where i was taking him .
are you telling me you don't know where james lives?
some apartment somewhere .
i've never seen it .
that strikes me as very odd .
james is odd .
i know his aunt lives in sewickley heights .
i dropped him there once .
come to think of it , it wasn't his aunt's house .
he said she worked there or something .
i don't remember .
i need my knapsack .
what's he saying?
his bag .
you know that ugly green thing he's always carrying around?
he must've left it inside .
aw , shit .
he left it at thaw .
the auditorium .
knapsack !
all right .
let him crash at my house .
where should i put him?
in the shape that he's in , you could stand him up ... in the garage next to the snow shovels , and he'd be all right .
grady , if you wanna talk later ...
i'll be up .
hey , guy !
tripp , the trunk .
you're killing me .
i'm gonna get it !
killin 'me !
you drivin 'this car?
excuse me?
this 1 966 maroon ford galaxy 500 .
you drivin 'this car?
this is my car .
bullshit !
it 's mine , motherfucker !
i'm afraid you're mistaken .
bullshit !
who is that?
oh , vernon , go home to your mother , will you?
what are you lookin 'at?
i'm lookin 'at you , fella .
hit it , will you?
come on , killjoy , go !
can we go now , den mother?
what's with you?
i wonder .
come on , crabs .
the kid was comatose .
who started that?
i was trying to calm him down .
oh , yeah , you calmed him down , dr. feelgood .
grady !
hit the brakes !
stop the car !
stop !
hey !
what's his problem?
back up !
get out of the car !
hey !
go around , go around him .
i'm stopping you !
i don't think so !
come back here !
what's this?
it 's a one way , guy .
go , go , go !
look out !
he 's back !
now what?
you owe him a book too?
you could always drive over him .
what the hell was that?
i just got my hood jumped on .
wait here .
i'll be right back .
where would we go?
hold on a second .
prof. tripp .
i guess you're here for the backpack .
it's traxler .
sam .
i saw the manuscript inside , so when you showed up i figured
the love parade .
so it was true .
the little prick had finished his book .
is it good?
i don't know .
it might be .
so there it was .
somewhere in the night a manhattan book editor ... was prowling the streets of pittsburgh ... best selling author at his side ... dead dog in his trunk .
say , prof. tripp .
is all that stuff true about errol flynn?
how he used to put paprika on his dick ... to make it , you know , like ... more stimulating for the chick?
christ , traxler , how the hell should i know?
you're reading his biography , aren't you?
oh .
no , it's true .
he used to rub all sorts of things on it .
salad dressing , ground lamb .
sick .
whenever i wondered what sara saw in me ... and i wondered more than once ...
i always came back to the fact that she loved to read .
she read everything , every spare moment .
she was a junkie for the printed word .
and lucky for me ...
i manufactured her drug of choice .
ls that your wife?
no , my wife's out of town .
what exactly are we doing here ...
prof. tripp?
taking the long way home .
take it easy , prof. tripp .
thanks for the ride .
i told myself ...
i needed to put everything aside for the moment .
emily , sara , the purloined jacket ... and the dead dog , and work on my book .
it was started out as a small book .
probably about , oh , 250 , 300pages .
it had gotten a little larger in scope .
and the ending , it kept getting further away .
but the ending was there .
i knew it .
i could almost see it .
james?
i'm okay .
i just lost my balance .
i put you on the floor .
oh .
thank you .
i thought you might swallow your tongue or something .
i guess you must really miss her , huh?
hmm?
oh , this .
no .
no , i just write in this .
this wasn't emily's .
i guess there's probably a story behind that .
there is , but it's not very interesting .

i'll drive .
let me get this straight .
jerry nathan owes you money ... so as collateral , he gives you his car .
only i'm beginning to think that the car ...
wasn't exactly jerry's to give .
ah , so whose car was it?
my guess?
vernon hard apple .
the hood jumper?
he said a few things that lead me to believe that the car was his .
such as?
" that's my car , motherfucker .
all right , so we find vernon , we find the car .
we find the car  we find the jacket .
wow .
christ !
how'd you know , tripp?
oh , i don't know .
let's just call it a hunch .
i call it genius .
good to know i'm still talented at something .
careful .
keep that motor running .
i know you .
double dickel on the rocks .
oola .
i never forget a drink .
i never forget an oola .
forget me?
vernon?
go inside , cupcake .
he's got a gun .
who's got a gun?
you've got a gun !
drop it !
uh oh .
vernon , relax .
why is he calling you vernon?
why is he sitting in my car?
he's crazy , that's why !
he probably calls everybody vernon .
now drop that gun !
oh , dear .
it's a souvenir .
they don't even have caps for this thing .
it's a souvenir .
bullshit !
i know a gun when i see one , and that's a gun !
no !
no , really  [ gunshot ]
oh , god !
oh !
gimme that gun !
are you crazy?
can't you see the condition my girl's in?
get out !
get out !
hey !
stop !
cupcake , you okay?
tripp , run !
who in the hell is that?
oh , shit !
vernon , don 't no !
don 't shoot !
oh , no !
don't !
don't shoot !
come on , tripp !
jump in !
run !
he's a crazy man .
oh , my god .
i take it back .
shoot him .
naturally , you have copies .
i have an alternate version of the first chapter .
you'll be all right , then .
look at
look at carlyle when he lost his luggage .
that was macaulay .
oh .
well , what about hemingway when hadley lost all those stories?
he was never able to reproduce them .
look , tripp , i don't wanna depreciate the loss here ... but maybe , you know , in a sense , it's for the best .
you suggesting it 's some kind of sign?
in a sense .
in my experience ... signs are usually a little more subtle .
let me get this straight .
all that paper that blew away back there ... that was the only copy?
i'm afraid so , yes .
and you , you're saying that it's some kind of a sign?
man , what in the fuck the matter with you?
don't .
all i'm saying is that sometimes , subconsciously ... a person will put themselves in a situation ... perhaps even create that situation ... in order to have an arena in which to work out an unresolved issue .
it's a covert way , if you will , of addressing a problem .
i'll tell you the problem .
you behind the wheel , there's your problem .
did you or did you not have a gun to his head?
watch the road , please .
he was trying to steal my car .
did you or did you not have a gun to his head?
all right !
all right !
that's enough !
that is enough !
what is done is done !
i don't wanna hear about it anymore , okay?
so what was it about , your book?
what was the story?
i don't know .
what he means is ... it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes ... because it lives in the mind .
but you got to know what it was about , right?
if you didn't know what it was about , why were you writing it?
i couldn't stop .
vernon , can i ask you a question?
boy or girl?
as long as it looks like her ...
i really don't care .
you
you know what i'm saying?
yeah .
thanks for the ride , vernon .
anytime .
and another thing .
yeah?
stop calling me vernon .
okay .
jacket , tripp .
what?
we need the jacket .
oh , right .
oola , about that jacket
yeah .
it used to belong to marilyn monroe .
really?
mm hmm .
she had small shoulders ... just like you .
a lot of people don 't know that .
thank you .
man , that book of yours must have been one nutty ride .
come on , baby .
let's go .
would you mind explaining to me what you just did?
came to my senses .
oh .
congratulations .
meanwhile , what's james supposed to do?
pray that walter gaskell comes to his?
walter gaskell doesn't wanna send james leer to jail .
he's up in his office right now .
he's talking to his parents , local police ... trying to find a solution .
tripp , the least they're gonna do is expel him .
it doesn't matter .
that's very enlightening , professor .
it's comforting to know that america's children ... have you for a teacher .
nobody teaches a writer anything .
you tell'em what you know .
you tell'em to find their voice and stay with it .
you tell the ones that have it to keep at it .
you tell the ones that don't have it to keep at it too ... because that's the only way they're gonna get to where they're going .
of course , it does help if you know where you wanna go .
helping my students figure that out ... that and sara ... that's what's made these last years worthwhile .
as for james , well , he doesn't really need me anymore .
he's got you .
me?
what can i do?
oh , i don't know , crabs .
improvise .
you're pretty good at that .
tripp .
i'm sorry .
improvise .
as for me , i was through improvising .
i knew what i had to do .
i had to find sara .
i had to convince her that she was my choice ... that , in fact , she had been from the very beginning .
and now , as those of you who've been with us in previous years know ... we have a tradition of sorts here at wordfest .
i'm speaking , of course , of the plums ... those fortunate local writers ... who have successfully placed their manuscripts ... with visiting publishers 'representatives .
this weekend , susan lowery of north braddock ... found a publisher for her children 's book ...
the loneliest prawn .
stand up , susan .
no w , this next one is , i think , very exciting to announce ... because it concerns a student here at the university .
our own james leer ... sophomore in english literature ... has found a publisher for his first novel ... which i believe is called ...
the lovely parade .
love parade .
love parade .
james?
stand up .
go on .
he 's a real alien probe , if you know what i mean .
take a bow , james !
wonder boy .
and finally , and perhaps not least importantly ...
terry crabtree of bartizan has also decided to publish my own book ... a critical exploration of the union of joe dimaggio ... and marilyn monroe ... and its function in american mythopoetics ... which , tentatively , i have entitled ...
the last american marriage .
so , until next year , thank you , everyone .
grady , i took another look ... at the arsonist's daughter the other night .
that description of the bald cypress left me breathless .
thanks , q.
i appreciate that .
sara !
@@ [ humming ]
yo , traxler .
hey , prof. tripp .
you get high , sam?
only when i'm workin '.
holy shit .
are you serious?
careful there , prof. tripp .
whoa .
i didn't fall .
not then , not ever again .
once the monongahela river swallowed my never ending opus ... there were no more spells .
james leer didn't get expelled or go to jail ... thanks to crabtree 's wheeling and dealing .
but he quit anyway , went to new york ... to rework his novel for publication .
hannah green has decided to take a position as a junior editor ... when she graduates .
and crabtree , well , crabtree 's gone right on being crabtree .
as for me , i lost everything . : my wife , my book , my job ... everything that i thought was important .
but i finally knew where i wanted to go .
