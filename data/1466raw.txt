god damn , it's hot .
are you done yet?
early admissions?
ivy leaguers love it .
gets 'em all wet .
all that studying finally pays off , and you get to leave this hellhole a year early .
damn , what is it , like 95 degrees?
can't wait to go to college , man .
it's like natural selection .
every hot chick you meet's got a brain .
not mine .
not mine .
you never forget the sight of a dead body but then again , i was experiencing a lot of things for the first time .
i guess it's just part of growing up .
how many calories in each stick?
550 .
how many grams of fat?
32 grams , but we do cook it in vegetable oil .
i'll take two then .
could i have mine extra crispy?
sure .
no problem .
it's not as hard as it looks .
all it takes is the extra five minutes reading the manual after you get hired .
the way i saw it , as long as it made it on my college application , it was all worth it .
you just can't count on good grades to get into a decent school anymore .
virgil and i have been friends since the fourth grade , when he moved to my school .
he was the other smart kid .
let's go , you perv .
dude , did you see the fucking rack on that?
man , middle aged hos are the finest .
this is han , virgil's cousin .
he's everything virgil's not .
you ladies ready?
i shoot 215 free throws a day .
my goal is to beat calvin murphy's record of 95 . 8 percent .
that's 207 baskets .
punctilious .
marked by or concerned about precise , exact accordance with the details of codes or conventions .
to get a perfect score on my next sat
i needed to improve my verbal score by 60 points .
i picked a new word every day and repeated it over and over again .
they say if you repeat something enough times , it becomes part of you .
punctilious .
adjective .
marked by or concerned about precise , exact accordance with the details of codes or conventions .
oh , we could rock
or we could bomb
or we could try
like super hard
or we could come
or we could lose
or we could totally totally , totally freak you
i wanna spread my dementia
i wanna knock it off the line
give me attention
every day and every night
whoo hoo ...
whoo hoo ...
stephanie vandergosh .
it's girls like her that make you realize that life's not fair .
i swear , i saw her in a porn .
what are you babbling about?
daric loo , academic all star .
but don't let the letterman jacket fool you it's for tennis .
hey , so we're using your credit card , right?
if we get caught , i'm saying you stole it from me .
nigga , please .
the amoeba is a primitive and simple organism , which absorbs its prey and incorporates it into itself .
miss vandergosh and miss nabham , is there something you would like to share with the class?
i thought as much .
uh , mr. farmer , please switch seats with miss vandergosh .
now that i have your complete attention , today we will see a movie .
it is entitled 'the amoeba '.
lunch time was club time .
this was where everyone loaded up on their extracurricular activities for their college app .
and , of course , daric was the president of every club . ... but , being part of an ecology club , it's important that we do .
unfortunately , all the really worthwhile things about high school were few and far between .
she is right down the hall
well , what i'm most concerned about are the abrasions on her arms and her back .
it was my fault ..
i fell down some stairs , but i feel fine now .
don't get me wrong .
i mean , i think there's some pretty fine looking bitches in high school .
it's just that they're all so fucking stingy about giving it up .
dude , you're a fucking virgin .
dude , i can get laid whenever i want to .
any time , anywhere , any place .
yeah , by who , your middle aged aunt?
no , but your mom's been looking mighty fine lately .
hey , shut the fuck up .
especially with those ... what was that thing she bought the other day?
okay , it comes to $482 . 82 .
is your brother carl?
yeah .
i thought you looked familiar .
i i'm virgil .
i was in , uh , cub scouts with your brother .
oh , this is my friend , ben .
hi .
hey .
so , uh , what are you doing these days?
i just got out of college .
oh , what was your major?
theater .
theater .
that's , that's ...
i love the theater , you know .
it's a ...
sign here .
that makes you , like , a thespian , right?
you know , you you have that , like , kind of an " x " factor , that charisma thing .
you definitely got it going , really .
thanks .
well , it was nice seeing you again .
yeah .
so ... plays .
let me know if you're ever in one or ...
hey , virg ...
so .
okay .
yeah .
yeah , cool .
yeah , di ...?
what the fuck was that?
what?
you're gonna get us caught !
watch it !
like she's gonna go for you .
at least i try .
that's enough , girls .
we were always pissed at virgil , but we always let it slide .
we had to .. he's like the little puppy that keeps shitting on the carpet .
hey , virg .
what color is the sticker today , man?
wake up !
orange .
give 'em up .
let's go .
fuck you .
hi .
hi .
it's my little brother , and he came home with all this computer stuff he can't afford .
so my mom ...
yeah .
do you have a receipt?
it started with a pack of baseball cards , and then it snowballed .
i guess it just felt good to do things that i couldn't put on my college application .
besides , it was suburbia ... we had nothing better to do .
our straight a's were our alibis , our passports to freedom .
going to a study group would get us out of the house until 4 : 00 in the morning .
as long as our grades were there , we were trusted .
we had it all .
well , almost .
uncap the needle .
swab the finger with the rubbing alcohol .
prick the finger .
come on , ben .
on three .
one ...
see , that wasn't so bad .
all right , let's go .
come on , now .
good job .
run !
come on , now .
get down , get down , run , run , run .
stay low when you make that pass .
got to get in front of him .
in front of him !

who wants that ball?
who wants it?
don't stand up .
do not stand up .

hey , stephanie .
oh , hey , ben .
how's it going?
good .
how's your finger?
oh .
i'll live .
you have a band aid on it .
yeah .
it's a pin prick .
don't you want to be a doctor or something?
if i don't play pro basketball .
aren't you a little short?
only the size of your heart matters .
that's corny .
what about you?
what do you want to be?
a cop .
really?
aren't you a little too short?
not when i have this .
ooh .
you're late .
sorry .
and you're not wearing a helmet .
oh .
ben , this is my boyfriend , steve .
steve , this is ben , my lab partner .
oh , yeah .
i have something for you .
what is this?
this isn't even due until next week .
i had some free time so i thought that ..
we're lab partners .
we're supposed to do this together .
give me a call .
we'll meet to do the assignment .
let's go .
later .
it's amazing what the right piece of clothing can do for your image .
i knew it was all bullshit , but , hell , i was milking it for all it was worth .
at first it didn't matter that i rarely saw any playing time .
i was part of the team .
but like everything else in life , you get sick of it .
at least it'll look good on my college app .
okay .
ain't no party like a wildcat party
ain't no party like a wildcat party .
look at that ass .
yeah .
what's up , ben?
hey , daric .
hey , you got a sec?
i'm trying to finish up this assignment .
okay .
cool .
so , ben , how do you feel about being a benchwarmer?
what?
well , you don't get to play much , right?
yeah , but we all have our roles on the team .
and what is your role?
i don't know .
i just hustle .
well , then how come you don't get to play in the games?
well , it's up to the coach .
well , how do you feel about being the token asian on a team?
what?
it's obvious to everyone the only reason that you're on the team is for cosmetic ones .
that's bullshit .
i bust my ass to be on this team .
but you never get to play .
so what?
i'm still on the team .
well , your coach could've picked anyone he wanted to just to sit on the bench .
maybe you should just ask him then .
okay .
awesome .
thanks , buddy .
hey , takeshi , can you , uh , give me a few close ups and a couple wides?
yeah , you got it .
hi .
is stephanie home?
hi .
hey .
stephanie , i just want to apologize for ...
ben , i'm in three honor classes , and i have a 3 . 8 gpa .
i know and i'm sorry .
i couldn't find the traits to phylum chordata in the book .
um , it's not in the book .
it was in his lecture .
see?
it was last tuesday's lecture . ... cells .
this one is more of a non sexual cell division .
right .
okay .
and that's when mitosis happens ...
that was one , anaphase?
anaphase .
and then metaphase , interphase and prophase .
you got it .
yes .
okay .
i think you're right .
let me just make sure .
when i'm right , i'm right .
you're right .
hello?
hey , steve o .
oh , ben and i are working on our bio homework .
yes , i'm sure .
can you hold on a minute?
i'll be right back .
yeah .
what?
do you want something to drink?
are you okay?
yeah .
where are you going?
it's getting pretty late .
but we haven't gone through meiosis yet .
well , i could stay .
thanks .
uh , okay .
meiosis .
hey , ben .
be there for you , man , every game .
we want ben !
we want ben !
we want ben !
daric ended up writing an article about me .
he even won some kind of journalism award for it .
it was some bullshit article about affirmative action in school sports to rile everyone up .
we want ben !
we want ben !
but i had to give it to him ...
the article worked .
if anyone at school didn't know what affirmative action was , they did now .
aw sh ...
ben , ben , get in .
go on .
get the fuck in there .
yeah !
math or verbal?
what the fuck do you want?
so how does it feel to be famous?
come on .
why'd you quit the team?
i was doing my job .
you call that piece of shit article journalism?
you didn't even interview my coach for his views .
i did .
he , uh , didn't say what i wanted him to , so i didn't put it in the story .
fucking prick .
it's just an article .
if you really liked what you were doing , you should have just kept on playing .
and have everybody think i'm on the team because i'm some token player?
who cares what other people think?
oh , yeah?
well , people also think that you gave mr. reid head to be the editor of the school paper .
well , i still am the editor .
god .
fuck off .
you know this is all bullshit , right?
it's just a game .
people like you and me , we don't have to play by the rules .
we can make our own .
do this by tomorrow , you get a fifty .
what?
hey , i don't just ask anyone to do this .
cheat sheets?
it's easy money .
ben , it's easier than fuck .
it's better than this sorry ass job .
see you tomorrow .
hey , ben .
hey .
uh , i'm getting my diet coke .
you guys want anything?
uh , yeah .
give me a root beer float to go .
i got it .
trig?
uh , yeah .
excuse me .
there's no smoking allowed in this cafe .
california state law .
sorry .

no .
i know some people .
i'll give them a call .
cool .
you like steph .
what?
you want to take her to the winter formal?
isn't that your job?
i don't get into all that bullshit .
why , you a fag or something?
what do you think?
hey .
thanks .
thanks , honey .
okay .
okay , i'll see you soon?
okay .
which species should we start with?
um , i was ... thinking about the , uh , chapter eight .

noun .
unwise boldness ; rash or reckless behavior .
oh oh .
nice .
good job .
oh , shit .
sorry , dude .
hey , man .
what's going on?

uh , me and ben?
oh .
yeah .

thanks .
what's up?
hey .
oh .
sweet .
aren't you gonna check it?
nah .
i trust you .
get going?
yeah .
all right?
academic decathlon was huge .
the most prized entry on a college application .
this was not like some community service club where you just walk in and sign out .
you had to earn your spot .
pygmy mouse lemur .
excellent .
tetrahydrocannabanol .
jersey , guernsey and albany .
hands by your side .

i saw stephanie vandergosh in a porn?
yeah .
i got it .
shut the fuck up .
i'll show you right now , fool .
oh , my god .
oh ...
so you've been hanging around that daric guy , right?
yeah .
is it true that he has his own house?
i don't know .
hmm .
han told me that his parents don't live here .
they're in , like , vancouver or something .
so what?
you know what i could do if i had my own pad?
jerk off at the dinner table?
ha ha .
your turn .
fucker .
what?
no hot tub?
well , you tell them , if they want me , they're gonna ante up with that hot tub !
tracy , what are you doing here?
well , i can give you a special tracy massage .
see?
i told you , punk ass .
no .
it's just the uniform .
uh uh .
it's got to be her .
oh , yes , tracy .
yeah .
work those pom poms .
i dare you to ask her boyfriend .
white dude , right?
no .
thank god .
oh , yeah .
oh , yes .
shake those pom poms .
ben?
huh?
you think you can talk to daric for me about doing the cheat sheets?
mm hmm .
uh huh .
how do you know about it?
i hear things .
han told me .
fucking daric's a senior .
someone's got to take over when he leaves .
all right .
the topic is population control , why retarded children and handicapped people should be executed in order to keep the population down .
ready?
is that true?
i think it was .
'cause it didn't sound like you knew it .
make sure your glasses are anti glare , okay?
let's see .
oh ...
decathlon practices were always held at daric's house .
finish it !
finish it !
his methods were definitely unconventional but effective .
beautiful .
rock , scissors , paper .
oh , fuck .
i'm so unworthy at this moment .
ah ...
dude .
dude , dude , you're gonna explode , man .
don't light that shit .
come on .
oh .
good bye , guys .
study hard .
come on .
oh .
not bad for academic decathlon , huh?
han had a friend named jesus who helped him steal , bribe or do whatever it took to get the test sheets for us .
i talked to daric and he was cool with virgil coming on board .
between the five of us , there wasn't anything we couldn't do .
the money was really good , but i don't think that's what attracted me the most .
okay , okay .
they got lucky .
but , you know , there is no reason a team of that caliber should be able to beat us .
god .
mary !
where's your tie?
i mean , our presentation absolutely sucked .
we looked like idiots .
rich , privy fucks .
press the button .
wait till the question is asked .
we're getting locked out and we can't even answer the question .
god !
ben .
fucking twinkie .
american history specialist .
the answer was 1973 , not '76 .
how many more , ben?
would you shut up?
i told you guys not to come .
woo !
so how's stephanie?
virg .
stephanie vandergosh?
i'm going out with her friday night .
i asked her out last week .
does she know it's a date?
why?
want to lay some money down on it?
yeah .
how 'bout an even hundred?
okay , you got it .

hey , daric wanted us to see it .
you know she has a boyfriend .
well , this'll teach that fuckhead to keep his mouth shut .
oh , fuck .
is that the guy from the privy school?
what does he think he is , some chinese movie star?
hi , i am chow yun fat .
hi .
i i i thought
i was gonna be fucking your girlfriend tonight .
i i guess not .
i guess i better go home and stroke myself really good .
let's go .
really , really good .
ahh !
hey , hold on , i'm just getting started .
get the fuck off my car .
ow .

you tell her and you get bonus points .
i'm not gonna be some rat .
besides , i don't even know for sure .

so , is everyone buzzed?
yo , can i have a light?
thanks , dude .
let's go around back .
hey , how's it goin '?
ah ... !
now i'm gonna throw up .
hey , what's up , boys?
i think they have ... bible study's next door , right?
oh , shit , no , look at this !
it's the chinese jordan !
hey , so , what's up , man?
where's all your fan club at , man?
i'm going to go check on virg .
yeah , what's up , shithead?
are you going to step up?
you know , you got to play a real sport to wear that jacket .
yeah , fuck him up , brian !

huh?
you want the cops?
you're what?
you're what?
i'm sorry , i'm sorry !

shoot him in the face .
if i ever see any of you and your fuck jock friends again ,
i'll fucking kill you !

you want some of this !
back off , man !
ben , come on !
back off !
come on , ben !
come on , ben !
fuck you , man !
screw you !
let's go !
fuckin 'a , that was better than sex .
just shut the fuck up .
did you see the look on that guy's face?
you put the fear of god in him , man .
the fear of gods .
i went jihad on his ass , man .
you see this blood on me , man?
it's not my blood .
did you see his face when we worked on him?
it was like ...
fuck , man , when you pulled out that gun , it was fucking awesome .
that was , like , boom !
right in your face .
he probably pissed himself right then in front of all his homies .
not me , man .
i was going off .
i felt so ...
i felt like surging through my body .
how smooth was that?
man , you had fucking balls !
that was fucking smooth !
the next minute , the gun was right in his face , and i was going off .. ah , yeah !
shit .
if my dad finds out , he's going to kill me .
man , i'm going to juvie !
by monday , the word had spread and pretty much everyone knew about it .
i was sure the cops were gonna come and get us that morning ...
but it never happened .
meeting today at 3 : 00 .
why?
we have to do this chem test .
it's a big one , about a hundred students .
guys ...
hi , guys .
hey .
hey .
ben , can i talk to you?
yeah .
he's fuckin 'whupped already .
what's up?
i just talked to steve .
yeah ...
what?
he said you're taking me to the formal .
you're fucking with me , right?
he said that you guys agreed to have you take me to the formal .
he did ask , i didn't agree .
the whole thing was pretty weird .
you should have at least told me .
well , he's your boyfriend .
i didn't want to get involved .
ben , that's what friends do .
god , i don't believe this .
why do i always get shit on?
you know , steve , he's the one that needs to stop ...
ben , i'm just trying to understand this .
i'm out of here .
what the fuck !
woo !
what?
the formal?
oh , what , got a hot date with barbie that night?
look , i'm not gonna say anything , all right , it's none of my business .
i just think she deserves better .
you're probably right .
as our reputation grew , scams started coming to us .
usually through jesus .
there they are .
what i liked about it was that we were in control .
if someone came to us about doing a scam and we didn't like them , we'd just tell them to fuck off .
having that kind of power quickly became an addiction .
what's up?
how's it going , man?
what's going on?
how are you doing?
man , not too bad .
this is peter .
so , what's up?
peter's got a sweet deal .
the school's getting in all new computer parts next week .
so?
so they've got to store them for a while until they can install them .
peter's got the school codes .
can they trace the code?
no , it's all the same number for everyone .
what about that fucking family that lives in the trailer guarding the school?
that's me and my dad .
he's out by 10 : 00 .
it's easy .
i don't know .
sounds too easy .
dude , i guarantee .
no offense ,
i don't give a shit about your guarantee .
me and ben checked it out .
seems legit .
han , think you can sell this shit off?
i can always sell the shit off .
we'll think about it .
peter , let's go .
you got the phone?
uh huh .
ah , god .
fuck .
it's clear .
we had the run of the place .
rumors about us came and went fast and furious .
one had us linked with some chinese mafia .
and it was fine with us because it just put more fear in everyone .
along with that power came greed .
it just made sense to expand our business into drugs , putting the law of supply and demand into practice .
i think our teacher would've been proud .
whoa .
let me see this thing .
fuck off .
it's got no name brand on it .
aw ... !
shit .
sorry , virg .
fuckin 'dick .
stop crying .
it's a piece of shit cd player anyway .
fuck you !
here .
now you can buy three of 'em .
i soon learned that along with an image , came maintenance .
i needed something to help expand my days .
it's literally a full time job just to make people believe who you're supposed to be .
four cheat sheets a day , the drugs , the scams .. between this and all my club commitments ,
i couldn't even start my homework until 1 : 00 a . m .
we were making so much money , we couldn't spend it fast enough .
if it was for sale , you could bet we tried to buy it .
is that enough?
mm hmm .
all right .
hey , tracy .
thanks , it's all there .
thank you .
so , what are you guys?
a club .
oh , like a math club or something?
we partied every weekend and hung out with different crowds .
it's funny , the more notorious we became , the more invitations we got .
we didn't know half the people we partied with ... but they knew us .
quixotic .
adjective .
extravagantly idealistic ; unpredictable ; unrealistic or imaginary .
shit .
you look like shit .
fifty .
oh , yeah .
here's the number for that internship
i was telling you about .
thanks .
yeah .
you want some?
you happy , ben?
i'm serious .
you happy?
i don't know .
fuck .
that's the most truthful thing i've ever heard .
at least you have a choice .
you're not happy?
i'm very happy .
isn't it obvious?
i have everything .
loving parents , top grades ,
ivy league scholarships , of course , stephanie .
of course .
right there .
that's it .
i'm so fucking happy i can't stop it .
why not?
it's a never ending cycle .
when you got everything you want , what's left?
you can't settle for being happy , that's a fucking trap .
you got to take life into your own hands .
do whatever it takes to break the cycle .
that's what it is , breaking the cycle .
you're fucked .
i envy you .
what?
what?
what?
what?
it was my 17th birthday .
no shit , man .
fuck , man .
i don't want to touch that .
i don't want to touch it with my hands , man .
there he is .
hey , ass wipe , you're the one that organized this " keep the beach clean " shit and you're late .
i need to talk to you guys .
grab a bag .
where's han?
sleeping .
what's up?
this better be fucking good .
i want out .
out of what?
i can't handle this anymore .
look , i woke up and my sheets were covered in blood .
well , why don't you stop
od'ing on that shit , you fuck?
yeah , too much of that shit will get to you .
i don't want to do it anymore .
all of it .
fuck , ben , stop being a pussy .
whatever , virg .
so is that it?
yeah , i just ...
i just want to concentrate on my own stuff .
hell , i was thinking the same thing .
give it up?
yeah .
fuck it .
it's like a job , man .
the only reason i did it was for you guys .
what are you saying?
have you two lost your fucking balls?
fuck it .
han and i will do it .
right , han?
it's all yours , man .
we got to talk .
just shut the fuck up .
more money for us .

a week later han got suspended from school for distributing cheat sheets .
it appeared that virgil's new position as head of the outfit had gone to his head .
he was babbling to so many people about it , the school had to do something .
the funny thing was ,
han didn't really care that he got suspended .
i think it just gave him yet another excuse to beat the crap out of virgil .

are you crazy?
she said she wanted to play rough .

i want to play rough .
virgil , put the gun down .
put the gun down .
virgil , put the gun down .

the morning after i lost my virginity , we won the national title .
i don't sell that shit no more .
that's cool .
how have you been?
haven't seen you since the ...
formal .
right .
hey , by the way ,
i never got a chance to thank you for taking stephanie .
she said she had the best time .
maybe you can take her to all the school functions .
you should try it .
you might like it .
it's all a superficial , bullshit waste of time .
yeah , you mentioned that .
i have a proposition for you .
actually , for you and your buddies .
look , that's all in the past .
listen , you guys are definitely going to like this .
it's too sweet .
no , thanks .
well , give me the other guys 'digits .
i thought we were friends .
that has nothing to do with this .
there's going to be a lot of money involved .
you already got all the money you need .
change .
i don't give a shit about the cash .
it s what we've been talking about .
it's time to break the cycle .
what?
listen , this is going to better everyone involved .
just trust me .
ben , did he tell you what this is all about?
no .
fuckin 'rich boy .
let's talk outside .
steve , this is virgil ...
hey . ... and han .
david , right?
daric .
sorry .
how's your stroke?
my stroke?
you guys want something to drink?
yeah , i'll take a beer .
beer .
okay .

i'll be right back .
what's up with that guy?
stroke?
hey , by the way , congrats on winning the nationals .
thank you .
what happened to you guys?
too many freshmen .
their fuckin 'brains froze in the semis .
what are you going to do?
the streak had to end sometime .
so , why are we here?
you're looking at it .
what?
we do my parents 'house .
yo , that's fucked up .
why?
it's none of your fuckin 'business .
okay .
let's go , guys .
everyone needs a wake up call .
i love them .
that's why i'm doing this .
i love them .
that's why i'm doing this .
that dude's fucked up .
let's do it .
let's fuckin 'do it .
no .
no .
we're not gonna rob anyone .
everyone needs a wake up call .
that's what he said , right?
let's fuckin 'give it to him .
look , that shit is just weird .
oh , yeah , it is .
we're gonna play along for a while , and then we're gonna teach that fucker a lesson .
virg , don't you see the way that guy talks to you?
that dude doesn't even think you're on the same level .
think about it .
what about you , han?
that rich motherfucker wants to punish his own family?
why?
because mommy and daddy won't pay enough attention to him?
and you .
he thinks you're fuckin 'dickless .
no?
well , why else would he let you take his girlfriend to the formal?
no .
no !
we'll just rough 'em up a little bit .
mostly ... we'll scare the shit out of him .
dude , this is brilliant .
after we fuckin 'beat the shit out of him , we could turn him in to the cops for conspiring to rob his own family .
exactly .
oh , yeah !
ooh .
come on , guys .
i don't know .
come on !
let's do it !
yeah .
it'll be fun .
all right , man , i'm just doing this so you don't fuck this up , all right?
yeah .
yeah !
no , i can't .
this'll be our blueprint .
let's start on page three .
by the way , i'm going to need a gun .
i know .
i'm working on it .
can i get one of those semiautomatics?
it'll cost you .
just take it out of my share .
no .
we'll need the money up front .
all right .
just let me know how much .
no problem .
steve was meticulous .
he had mapped out each of our paths for the robbery .
he made us do it over and over until he felt we got it .
i just don't know what stephanie found so attractive .
so ...
at all ! ... han , you think you can break in?
fuck , yeah .
that's it .
i can't handle it anymore .
i ain't going to the meeting tomorrow .
shut up !
look , we all have to do it , or it'll just fuck it all up .
well , i still ain't going !
dude , why?
'cause chrissy's throwin 'a party tomorrow .
why don't we just invite him to come?
he's the one who said we should get to know each other .
whatever .
you think he'll show?
who cares , man?
at least we don't have to sit through all that bullshit .
i can't wait till this is all over .
you watch .
it'll all be worth it .
be right back .
hey , steph .
hey , ben .
where's steve?
i don't know .
he told me to meet him here .
he's on time as usual .
hey .
whoa .

i just turned in my apps last month .
what about you?
ah , it'll be an ivy league for sure .
i don't know which yet .
you already got in?
yeah , of course .
you'll have to excuse steve .
he gets cocky when he's drunk .
only when he's drunk?
excuse me , guys .
too much testosterone .
did i say something?
so , this is like the " i love stephanie " fan club .
you know , daric , you're a pretty cool guy .
i can't believe steph thought you were a stalker or something .
yo , what'd you think of her friend?
what friend?
the one she brought to mini golf .
all right .
yeah .
isn't steph the best?
you want a drink?
yeah , whatever you get .
all right .
ben?
i'm good .
thanks , d rock .
anytime , stevie boy .
why you hang out with him , ben?
he's got something up his ass all the time .
he's all right .
yo ...
steph's the one .
steph's the one .
you were right .
she deserves to be treated better .
i'm going to treat her better .
i owe it all to you , man .
thank you .
steve , you're wasted .
thanks , man .
okay .
you're welcome .
you're welcome .
all right .
i'll be right back .
okay .
all right .
thank you .
at that point , by the look in daric's eyes ,
i knew it was on .
it was new year's eve .
jesus said we could use his house if we paid him a hundred bucks .
his parents had left for tahoe a day earlier .
i still thought it was a bad idea , so the guys and i made a compromise .
all i had to do was be the lookout .
hey .
hey .
they're right around back in the garage .
i'll be in there in a sec .

i knew what i had to do .
of course , the right thing to do was to call the police and tell them everything .
it was right ... but it didn't mean it was easy .
yo , virg , i'm here .
let's go , man .

so ... what , is he going to be retarded , or something?

you haven't seen steve , have you?
steve?
get in .
he's been gone for a couple days , and he's got everyone worried .
are you worried?
yeah , but you just never know what steve's up to .
ben , thanks for putting up with this .
what?
the whole thing with me and steve .
you know how you make decisions that lead to other decisions?
yeah .
then you realize you don't remember why you made those decisions in the first place .
yeah .
when i saw you on new year's eve ,
i knew there was only one right thing to do .
for the first time in my life ,
i don't know what my future will hold .
i don't even know what the other guys are going to do .
all i know is that there's no turning back .
all i know is that there's no turning back .
you said you had no place to go
while standing in the doorway of our home
and i'm here waiting to see
if you've come and found the key
i went and put it where it used to be
but i'm not waiting on eventually
no , i'm not waiting
are we only scraps
of everything we hoped that we could be?
and i'm not waiting on eventually
no , i'm not waiting
build your house from scraps
make a home out of laughs
build your house from scraps
make a home out of laughs
and laugh
and laugh
and laugh
and laugh
and laugh
and laugh .
