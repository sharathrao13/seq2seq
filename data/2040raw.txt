now , i just met her , but she is fine as hell .
her name is ...
susan !
susan .
he right !
oh , shit .
my daughter , susan .
you are not going to like what happens in practice on monday .
you think you've run for me before?
i come to your rooms to celebrate with you , and you sneak
i end up taking a road trip to the suburbs , where i find my drunk ass point guard on top of daddy's little princess !
actually , i was on the bottom , coach .
she was on the top .
worm , do you wanna be on this team?
because you're about six words from getting kicked off and kicked off the goddamn bus !
cruz , open your eyes !
ghetto hoop stars !
signing autographs and humping the honeys !
well , i'm gonna show you what humping is .
coach , we won the tournament .
we undefeated .
i mean , ain't that what you wanted?
winners?
oh , no .
oh , no , no , no .
oh , no !
god !
you guys are awesome !
what's up , cruz?
i don't know .
coach giving us a day off , i guess .
yo , i don't even know where the library's even at .
i bet you don't .
" library's at "?
he don't know where the library's at .
quiet .
quiet !
gentlemen , in this hand , i hold contracts signed by me and signed by you .
ln this hand , i hold academic progress reports prepared by your teachers .
we have six players failing at least one class , eight players getting incompletes based on attendance .
gentlemen , you have failed to up
no , i'm sorry .
we have failed .
we have failed each other .
now , there are some of you who have upheld this contract .
but know that we are a team .
and until we all meet the terms of this contract , the gym will remain locked .
locked?
what?
what you mean , locked?
what , like for the day?
he must mean for the day .
mr. thompson ,
mr. gesek and miss sherman have generously volunteered their time to help us reach our goals .
but , coach , i have a 3 . 3 .
that's good , sir .
do you score all the points for the team too?
we are the richmond oilers .
do you know what oilers stands for?
sir?
know that you're not just walking out on me .
you're walking out on them .
i had to beg you .
and then i ran all those sprints .
i did all that shit .
i killed myself for you , sir , to get back on the team .
this is bullshit .
you put a lock on the gym and forced them to meet you in the library?
are you crazy?
miss garrison .
i'm surprised you know where my office is .
take the lock off that gym .
my phone hasn't stopped ringing .
maybe someone on the other end of that phone has a solution to our problem .
your intentions are good , mr. carter , but your methods are a bit extreme .
you painted an extreme picture .
no one expects them to graduate , no one expects them to go to college .
so you take away basketball , the one area of their lives
where they have some success?
yes , ma'am .
and you challenge them academically?
yes , ma'am .
and what if they fail?
then we've failed .
unfortunately , mr. carter , both you and i know that for some of these kids , this basketball season will be the highlight of their lives .
well , i think that's the problem .
don't you?
good morning , coach carter .
good morning .
quite the pandora's box you've opened .
oh , i get all the blame now?
let's just say i'm happy to give you all the credit .
i've got every news reporter in town waiting to speak to you .
got a press conference set up around the front of the gymnasium .
coach carter has taken the lockout to the next level by canceling last night's game .
richmond forfeited the game , making it their first loss of the season .
and for now , the lock remains on the gym .
here he comes .
here he comes now .
coach carter !
coach !
can i get a question?
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
i'd like to thank you for your patience .
at this time , i'd like to introduce coach ken carter .
you may direct your questions to him .
mr. carter , is it unfair to the players whose grades qualify them to play?
basketball's a team sport , sir .
we support each other on and off the court .
anybody still think coach bluffing now?
i feel like running right up in the middle of all those reporters and telling them i think this is bullshit , son .
maybe you should've gone to class , lyle .
maybe you should kiss my ass , dog .
my grades are fine , homeboy .
it's junior they should've locked out .
maybe junior will kick your ass out .
why don't you try spelling it , then .
chill , chill , chill , man .
damn .
junior , if you need help , i'll tutor you .
man , i don't need no help .
well , he ain't lock us out for no reason .
we been tripping lately , man .
all y'all know it .
how do you think the community's gonna react to this lockout?
i'm not really sure .
i hope they'll support these young men .
what , man?
no , man , it's just funny , dog , because , junior , man , you thought it was bad all us knew your dumb ass was failing science .
now the whole world about to know your dumb ass failing science .
man .
hey , man .
and you have fremont this saturday , the biggest game on your schedule .
now , richmond is gonna riot if you forfeit that game .
saturday is a long way off .
we'll see what happens .
thank you all for coming .
that's all the time i have right now .
i have to get back to work .
coach , have you talked to any of the parents?
thank you for your time , ladies and gentlemen .
i'd like to remind you that classes are in session , so as you leave campus , please do so quietly .
i ain't turning the cheek .
he come up in my 'hood , i'm serious , it's on .
young sirs .
it's always been like that .
it's been a long day .
reporters .
media everywhere .
let's take this time to say whatever it is we want while the doors are closed .
you have the floor .
this is about us .
man , this shit ain't about us .
this is all about coach carter .
we're the basketball team .
all i see is you on tv , getting famous , eating that shit up .
ls that all you see?
it's all i see .
you ain't lying .
well , let me tell you what i see .
i see a system that's designed for you to fail .
now , i know you all like stats , so let me give you some .
richmond high only graduates 50 percent of its students .
and of those that do graduate , only 6 percent go to college .
which tells me , when i walk down the halls and i look in your classrooms , maybe only one student is going to go to college .
well , damn , coach carter , if i ain't going to college , where i'm gonna go?
now , that's a great question .
and the answer for young african american men in here is this : probably to prison .
ln this county , 33 percent of black males between 1 8 and 24 get arrested .
so look at the guy on your left .
now look at the guy on your right .
one of you is going to get arrested .
growing up here in richmond , you're 80 percent more likely to go to prison than college .
those are the numbers .
those are some stats for your ass .
now , i want you to go home ... ... and look at your lives tonight ... ... and look at your parents 'lives ... ... and ask yourself , " do i want better?
lf the answer is yes ,
i'll see you here tomorrow .
and i promise you ... ... l will do everything in my power to get you to college and to a better life .
i don't understand this .
it's a letter , how can it be a number?
how are balancing those equations coming?
i can't do this .
hold on .
come on , son .
don't give up yet , son .
here's a story out of california that's getting national attention .
the entire boys 'basketball team at richmond high school has been benched .
the highly ranked oilers have a perfect season on the court , but some players were in big trouble academically .
and in an unprecedented move , coach ken carter canceled practice ,
locked the gym and sent his players straight to the library .
now , at the start of the season ,
i understand you made all of your players sign a contract before they could join the team .
what exactly were the conditions of that contract?
the contract states that the players must maintain a 2 . 3 grade point average and that the players must attend all their classes and sit in the front row of those classes .
well , coach carter , it's an unusual strategy , and a risky one in a sense , in light of your team's winning record , but i think there's gonna be a lot of people out there pleased to learn that at least somebody still cares about the concept of a student athlete .
thanks a lot for joining us today .
i'm sorry to disturb you .
i'm coach ken carter of the richmond high school basketball team .
oh , yeah .
i need to ask you a favor .
my team is studying in the library , and i've been trying to tell them that brains and beauty are a perfect combination .
know what i'm saying?
i mean , i'm worm , baby .
how would you like to watch the worm work?
hey , where did you get that backpack?
watch out , too short .
why study earth science or history or algebra?
getting good grades in those subjects , combined with basketball skills , can get you into college .
girl , you should've bought it .
i would've worn it .
you selfish son of a bitch .
you snake .
miss  no , no , don't " miss " me , snake .
mr. carter , you remember me?
now , after all the things that my son has been through for your team , for you to go lock up this gym like this , how dare you ...

the state only requires a 2 . 0 gpa for participation in extracurricular activities .
yes , ma'am .
and according to your contract , the players are agreeing to maintain a 2 . 3?
that , among other things .
yes , ma'am .
other things like ...?
attending all classes , sitting in the front row of those classes , and wearing a tie on game day .
i see .
mr. carter , does the lockout include practices and games?
and do you have a set period of time?
there will be no basketball , ma'am .
please .
quiet , please .
that includes practices and games , until we as a team reach the agreed upon gpa .
please , quiet .
please , quiet .
quiet .
thank you , mr. carter .
ln the interest of time , i'd like to open this board meeting up for comments .
as a teacher , i was offended when asked by a coach to provide progress reports .
nowhere in my contract does it say that i have to do so .
it creates more work .
this lockout has brought negative media attention that questions our abilities as educators .
end this madness .
end this lockout .
i'm jason lyle's uncle .
that boy lives to play ball .
comes to school every day now .
you take away basketball ,
god knows what he'd be into .
yesterday , he canceled the fremont game .
now , that's the biggest game of the year .
i have scouts coming to watch my boy play .
me too .
these boys are 1 6 0 .
this whole school , this whole community , is behind this team .
everybody goes to every game .
basketball is the only thing that these boys have got .
are we gonna let carter come in here and take that away from them?
no !
i don't think so .
not gonna happen .
i'd like to make a motion .
yes , mr. walters?
i move that we remove mr. carter as head basketball coach .
order , please .
order .
this board does not have the authority to terminate employment of a staff position .
then i move we end the lockout and let the kids play .
i second the motion .
okay .
lf i may?
yes , mr. carter .
you really need to consider the message that you're sending these boys .
it's the same message that we as a culture send to our pro athletes , which is that they are above the law .
now , i'm trying to teach these boys the discipline that will inform their lives and give them choices .
lf you endorse the fact that 1 5 , 1 6 and 1 7 year olds don't have to honor the simple rules of a basketball contract , how long do you think it'll be before they're out there breaking laws?
now , i played basketball at richmond 30 years ago .
it was the same thing then .
some of my teammates ended up in prison .
some of them ended up dead .
i took this job because i wanted to effect change in a special group of young men , and this is the only way i know how to do that .
lf you vote to end the lockout , you won't have to terminate me .
i'll quit .
good .
thank you , mr. carter .
the board now recognizes five voting members .
ln this instance , we will be accepting the vote of principal garrison as well .
now , i put to those members the vote on whether or not to end the lockout .
all those in favor of ending the lockout will raise their right hand when called upon .
i will vote first by not raising my hand .
principal garrison?
valerie walker .
benson chiu .
parent rep , mr. cepeda .
and ms. nyugen .
yes .
thank you .
the lockout ends with a vote of 4 to 2 .
lf there's no other business , this board meeting is adjourned .
thank you all for coming .
mr. carter .
are you sure you wanna do this?
look , i know we haven't always seen eye to eye , but you've done such a great job with these boys , it seems wrong to just
look .
no offense , ma'am , but all the work i did with those boys was negated when they ended the lockout .
i don't think that's true , l
the board sent the message loud and clear .
winning basketball games is more important than graduating from high school and going to college .
i'm sorry , i just can't support that message .
sir , they can cut the chain off the door , but they can't make us play .
we've decided we're gonna finish what you started , sir .
yeah , so leave us be , coach .
we got shit to do , sir .
our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate .
our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure .
it is our light , not our darkness that most frightens us .
your playing small does not serve the world .
there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you .
we were all meant to shine , as children do .
it's not just in some of us , it's in everyone .
and as we let our own light shine , we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same .
as we are liberated from our own fear , our presence automatically liberates others .
sir , i just wanna say thank you .
you saved my life .
thank you , sirs .
all of you .
academic progress reports , young men .
these things are ... ... unbelievable .
i know you've been trying .
i guess there's only one way to say this .
gentlemen , we've reached our goal .
let's play ball .
rich what?
richmond !
rich what?
richmond !
rich what?
richmond !
hustle back .
get back , get back .
set it , worm .
set it .
watch baseline .
take it .
take it , come on .
yes !
find a man .
find a man .
swing it , swing it .
go , go , go .
go , go .
come on !
go richmond !
hold the ball , hold the ball !
nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , see you !
great game , coach .
good game .
richmond returns from their lockout and keeps their streak alive at 1 7 games .
a team that won only four games last year is now a cinderella team that has to be thinking that there's a chance of getting the phone call to come to the dance .
ls richmond headed for the state tournament?
so , what else y'all gonna do at the park when you go?
seesaw .
seesaw?
you're gonna seesaw?
yeah .
who's gonna push you?
my mommy's gonna push me .
yeah?

a lot of things .
especially us .
kenny , l  kyra , just listen .

for a long time , it's just been my moms , my boys and you .
and that's what i counted on .
i'm trying to count on myself now , and i'm all right and shit , it's just , without you , nothing good feels as good .
it's like i'm missing some happy part of me .
i got you something .
and it ain't from the 99 cent store .
shut up .
they gave you a scholarship?
yeah , baby , a full ride .
oh , my gosh .
that is crazy .
oh , my gosh .
i know you gonna kill it up there .
no , we gonna kill it up there .
i told them about you and the baby .
they wanna help us .
kenyon ... ... there is no more baby .
i decided not to go through with it .
kyra .
i had a choice to make , so i made it .
for me , kenny .
well , when ...?
why didn't you tell me?
i would have gone with you .
i'm so sorry .
kyra , i'm so sorry you had to go through that by yourself .
my mom went with me .
but i think that ...
i think you should go to school and play ball and do your thing .
you know?
i want that for you .
and that's real .
i think you should be all you can .
i want you to come with me .
kyra , i love you .
i want you to come with me .
you serious?
i'm serious .
oh , my god .
i love you .
i love you too .

welcome , ladies and gentlemen , to the first round of the clf playoffs .
st. francis is one of the best high school teams in the nation , with ty crane believed to be a shoo in for the top nba draft pick next year .
on the other side of the court is richmond , a team that's had a media worthy season as well .
richmond high has never played in a state tournament .

we run the ball .

worm , you can take this kid .
force him left , and when he crosses over , you jump him .
damien , push the tempo .
kenyon , lyle , crash the boards .
cruz , when you're in the game in transition , take that jumper you love .

keep your head up , baby .
well , not quite your storybook ending , huh?
not for us , anyway .
but you men played like champions .
you never gave up .
and champions hold their heads high .
what you achieved goes way beyond the win loss column or what's gonna be written on the front page of the sports section tomorrow .
you've achieved something that some people spend their whole lives trying to find .
what you achieved is that ever elusive victory within .
and , gentlemen ... ... l am so proud of you .
four months ago , when i took the job at richmond , i had a plan .
that plan failed .
i came to coach basketball players , and you became students .
i came to teach boys ... ... and you became men .
and for that , i thank you .
lf someone walked in this door right now and offered me the coaching job at any school in the state of california , you know which team i'd choose?
st. francis?
i'm just saying , man .
kenyon?
richmond?
