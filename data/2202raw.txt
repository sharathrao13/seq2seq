stalker
what was it?
a meteorite?
a visit of inhabitants of the cosmic abyss?
one way or another , our small country has seen the birth of a miracle the zone .
we immediately sent troops there .
they haven't come back .
then we surrounded the zone with police cordons ...
perhaps , that was the right thing to do .
though , i don't know ...
from an interview with nobel prize winner , professor wallace .
why did you take my watch?
where are you going , i'm asking you?
you gave me your word and i believed you .
all right , you're not thinking about yourself , but what about us?
did you think about your child?
she's just getting used to you , and you start it again !
you've made an old woman of me .
you've ruined my life .
not so loud , you'll wake up monkey .
i can't wait for you forever .
i'm going to die !
you wanted to start working !
you've been promised a normal human work !
i'll be back soon .
you'll be back to prison !
though this time you'll get ten years , not five !
and for ten years you will have neither your zone , nor anything !
and i'll be dead in the meantime .
oh god , for me it's prison everywhere !
let me go !
no !
let go , i said !
go !
and may you rot there !
be damned the day when i met you , bastard !
god himself has cursed you by giving you this child !
and me too , because of you , jerk !
my dear , our world is hopelessly boring .
therefore , there can be no telepathy , or apparitions , or flying saucers , nothing like that .
the world is ruled by cast iron laws , and it's insufferably boring .
alas , those laws are never violated .
they don't know how to be violated .
so don't even hope for a ufo , that would have been too interesting .
and how about the bermuda triangle?
you're not going to deny ...
i am .
there is no bermuda triangle .
there's only triangle abc that equals triangle a prim , b prim , c prim .
do you feel the boredom contained in this assertion?
to live in the middle ages was interesting .
every home had its house spirit , and every church had its god .
people were young !
now every fourth is an old person .
it's so boring , my angel .
but you said that the zone was the product of a superior civilization ...
it must be boring , too , all those laws , triangles , and no house spirits , and no god , that's for certain .
because if god is also a triangle , then i don't know what to think .
it's for me !
great !
goodbye , my dear friend .
this lady was so kind as to agree to go with us to the zone .
she's a very courageous woman .
her name is ...
i beg your pardon , your name is ..?
are you really a stalker?
wait ...
i'll explain everything .
go ...
what a cretin !
you did get drunk after all .
me?
what do you mean?
i had a drink , like one half of the population does .
the other half gets drunk .
including women and children .
i just had a drink though .
damn it , what a mess here .
go on , drink .
we've got time .
how about a glass for the road?
what do you think?
take it away .
i see .
dry law .
alcoholism is a scourge of mankind .
all right , we'll drink beer .
is he with us?
never mind , he'll sober up .
he needs to go there , too .
are you really a professor?
if you don't mind .
then let me introduce myself .
my name is ...
your name is writer .
well .
and what is my name?
yours?
professor .
i see .
i'm a writer , so , naturally , everyone calls me writer for some reason .
and what do you write about?
about the readers .
obviously , there's nothing else one should write about .
one should write about nothing at all .
and what are you?
a chemist?
a physicist rather .
that must be boring , too .
searching for the truth .
it's hiding and you keep searching for it .
you dig in one place eureka !
the nucleus is made of protons .
you dig in another great !
triangle abc equals triangle a prim , b prim , c prim .
with me it's quite different .
while i am digging for the truth , so much happens to it that instead of discovering the truth
i dig up a heap of , pardon ...
i'd better not name it .
you're lucky !
but imagine some antique pot displayed in a museum .
it was used at its time as a receptacle of food leftovers , but now it's an object of universal admiration for its laconic pattern and unique form .
everyone goes oh ! and ah !
and suddenly it turns out that it's not antique at all , that some joker has palmed it off on the archeologists just for fun .
strange as it may seem , the admiration dies off .
those connoisseurs ...
is it what you think about all the time?
god forbid !
in fact , i don't think much .
it's not good for me .
it's impossible to write , thinking all the time of success or failure .
naturlich !
but if no one is going to read me in one hundred years , why the hell should i write at all?
tell me , professor , why did you let yourself be mixed up in all this?
what do you need the zone for?
i'm a scientist in some sense .
but what do you need it for?
you're an " in " writer .
women must be running after you in flocks .
my inspiration has been lost , professor .
i go begging for it .
have you been used up?
what?
yes , i guess , in a way .
do you hear it?
our train .
have you taken the roof off the car?
yes , i have .
luger , if i don't come back , call on my wife .
damn it , i forgot to buy cigarettes .
don't go back .
why?
you must not .
you're all like this .
like what?
believing such nonsense .
well , i'd better leave it for a rainy day .
are you really a scientist?
down !
don't move !
go and look , is there anyone there?
move it , for god's sake !
there's no one there .
go to the other exit .
where on earth did you look , writer?
you didn't forget the jerry can?
no .
it's full .
everything i told you before ... is a lie .
i don't give a damn about inspiration .
how would i know the right word for what i want?
how would i know that actually i don't want what i want?
or that i actually don't want what i don't want?
they are elusive things : the moment we name them , their meaning disappears , melts , dissolves like a jellyfish in the sun .
my conscience wants vegetarianism to win over the world .
and my subconscious is yearning for a piece of juicy meat .
but what do i want?
world domination .
quiet !
why a diesel locomotive in the zone?
it services the outpost .
it won't go any farther .
they don't like going there .
take your places !
everybody here?
the guards have arrived .
tell them to turn the tv off .
hurry !
go look if there s a trolley on the tracks .
what trolley?
go back , i'll do it .
the jerry can !
give it to me !
get rid of your knapsack , it's hampering you .
you may travel light , if you wish , as if going for a stroll .
if someone gets hit , don't shout or rush about .
if they see you , they'll kill you .
when everything settles down , crawl back to the outpost .
they'll pick you up in the morning .
can they catch up with us?
they fear it like the plague .
fear what?
here we are ... home , at last .
how quiet it is .
this is the quietest place in the world .
you'll see for yourselves .
so beautiful here .
not a single soul here .
what about us?
three men can't spoil the place in one day .
why?
they can .
it's strange that flowers don't smell .
or have i ...
do you feel anything?
i feel the stench of the bog .
no , that's the river .
there's a river here .
there was a flower bed nearby , but porcupine had trampled it down .
the smell lingered for many years though .
why did he do it?
i don't know .
i asked him why , too .
you'll understand later .
i think he just came to hate the zone .
porcupine , that's his name?
a nickname , like yours .
he had been taking people to the zone for years , and no one could stop him .
he was my teacher .
he opened my eyes .
he was called teacher then , not porcupine .
then something happened to him , something broke in him .
though i think he was punished .
will you help me?
tie those strips of bandage to the nuts .
and i ... will go for a walk .
i need to do something ...
don't go anywhere .
where's he going?
he wants to be alone , i guess .
why?
even with the three of us together , i feel weird .
a date with the zone .
he's a stalker .
and what does that mean?
you see , being a stalker is some sort of calling .
i thought he'd be different .
like what?
well , you know , the leather stockings , chingachgook sort of things ...
his background is even more frightful .
several times in prison , then he was harmed here .
he has a mutant daughter , " a victim of the zone " as they call it .
they say she's got no legs .
and what about this porcupine?
what does it mean , " was punished "?
or was it just a figure of speech?
one day porcupine returned from here and got rich overnight .
fabulously rich .
you call it punishment?
a week later he hanged himself .
why?
quiet !
what was that?
presumably a meteorite fell down here about twenty years ago .
it had burned down the settlement .
they searched for this meteorite , but never found it , of course .
why " of course "?
then people began disappearing here .
they came here and never returned .
so it was concluded ... that this meteorite was not really a meteorite .
at first ... they circled the place with barbed wire to scare off the inquisitive .
all this gave rise to rumours that there's a place in the zone ...
where wishes come true .
naturally , they began to guard the zone like the apple of their eye .
who knows what kind offish someone might cherish .
what was it if not a meteorite?
i told you , no one knows .
and what do you think?
nothing .
or anything .
a message to mankind , as one of my colleagues says .
or a gift .
some gift .
why on earth would they do it?
to make us happy .
the flowers are blooming again , but they don't smell for some reason .
sorry for leaving you two here , but it was too early to go anyway .
did you hear it?
maybe someone lives here?
who?
you told me yourself about some tourists camped here when the zone originated .
there's no one in the zone and there can't be .
well , it's time .
how are we going to return?
they don't return here .
what do you mean?
we'll go as we agreed .
i'll show the direction .
any deviation from it is dangerous .
the first landmark is that last pole .
you go first , professor .
now you .
try to follow in his footsteps .
oh , my god !
and where are ...
did they remain here like that?
those people?
who knows .
i remember them packing at the station , getting ready to come here .
i was just a boy .
we all thought then that somebody wanted to conquer us .
you first , professor .
now you , writer .
your room is over there .
we'll go this way .
why were you hiking up the price?
it's so close at hand .
yes , but the hand has to be very long .
we don't have such a hand .
don't !
leave it alone !
don't touch it !
don't touch it , i said !
are you crazy?
what's the matter with you?
it's not the place for leisurely strolls .
the zone wants to be respected .
otherwise it will punish .
don't you ever try it again ...
have you no tongue or what?
i warned you , didn't i?
are we to go there?
yes .
up , enter it and to the left .
only we are not going this way .
we'll go around .
why?
people don't go this way .
in the zone , the longer way , the less risk .
and to go straight ahead is fatal?
he told you it's dangerous .
and making a detour's not dangerous?
it is .
but they don't go this way .
what do i care that they don't?
what if i take a chance ...
listen , what's the matter with you ...
to go all the way around !
when everything's so close .
here a risk , there a risk .
what the hell !
you're being very flippant about this .
i'm fed up with all those nuts and bandages .
you may do as you wish , but i'm going .
you're insane .
it's you who are ...
may i?
the wind is coming up ...
can you feel it?
the grass ...
all the more so .
what do you mean?
wait !
keep your hands off !
professor be my witness , i didn't sent you there .
you go of your own will .
of my own will .
what else?
nothing .
go .
god help you to be lucky .
listen !
should you notice something , or just feel something , go back at once , or ...
just don't throw iron poles at me .
stop !
don't move !
why did you do it?
why did i do what?
why did you stop him?
i thought it was you ...
what's up?
why did you stop me?
i didn't stop you .
who did it then?
you?
who the hell knows ...
you're smart , mister shakespeare .
to go straight ahead is scary , to go back is embarrassing .
so you gave yourself a command .
fear has made you come to your senses .
what?
stop it .
why have you emptied the bottle?
stop it , i said !
the zone is a very complicated system ... of traps , and they're all deadly .
i don't know what's going on here in the absence of people , but the moment someone shows up , everything comes into motion .
old traps disappear and new ones emerge .
safe spots become impassable .
now your path is easy , now it's hopelessly involved .
that's the zone .
it may even seem capricious .
but it is what we've made it with our condition .
it happened that people had to stop halfway and go back .
some of them even died on the very threshold of the room .
but everything that's going on here depends not on the zone , but on us !
so it lets the good ones pass and kills the bad ones?
i don't know .
i think it lets those pass who ... have lost all hope .
not good or bad , but wretched people .
but even the most wretched will die if they don't know how to behave .
you have been lucky , it just warned you .
i guess i'll wait for you here until you come back , made happy .
it's impossible !
i've got sandwiches , a thermos ...
you won't last even an hour here without me .
besides , one doesn't return here the way one comes .
anyway , i would prefer ...
then we're going back right away .
i'll return your money minus a certain sum for the trouble , so to speak ...
have you come to your senses , professor?
all right .
go on , throw your nut .
part two
stalker
where are you?
come here !
are you tired?
oh , god !
judging by his tone , he's going to start sermonizing again .
let everything that's been planned come true .
let them believe .
and let them have a laugh at their passions .
because what they call passion actually is not some emotional energy , but just the friction between their souls and the outside world .
and most important , let them believe in themselves
let them be helpless like children , because weakness is a great thing , and strength is nothing .
when a man is just born , he is weak and flexible , when he dies , he is hard and insensitive .
when a tree is growing , it's tender and pliant , but when it's dry and hard , it dies .
hardness and strength are death's companions .
pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being .
because what has hardened will never win .
come here !
we're progressing well .
soon we'll come to a dry tunnel , after that it will get easier .
knock on wood .
are we on our way already?
of course .
why?
i thought you just wanted to show us something .
what about my knapsack?
what about it?
i left it there .
i didn't know we were going .
there's nothing we can do about it .
no , we have to go back .
it's impossible !
i can't do without my knapsack !
can't you understand that no one here has ever come back the same way?
forget about your knapsack .
what have you got there , diamonds?
the room will give you anything you want .
really .
it will drown you in knapsacks .
how far is it , this room?
if you go straight , about 200 meters , but there's no going straight here .
let's go .
give up your empiricism , professor .
miracles are outside empiricism .
remember how st. peter was nearly drowned?
go , writer .
go where?
up these stairs .
professor , where are you?
here is the dry tunnel !
you call it dry?
this is a local joke .
normally one has to swim here .
wait , where's professor?
what?
professor has disappeared !
how could it happen?
he was following you all the way .
he probably lagged behind and lost his way .
no , he didn't lose his way !
he must've gone for the knapsack !
he won't be able to make it now .
shall we wait for him?
we can't .
things change here every minute .
we'll have to go .
look !
what is it?
how could it be?
i already explained .
what did you explain?
it's the zone , don't you understand?
let's go , quick .
it's ...
there he is !
i'm certainly grateful to you that you ... but ...
how did you get here?
mostly i had to crawl up here on my fours .
incredible .
how did you manage to overtake us?
what do you mean , " overtake "?
i came back here for the knapsack .
and how has our nut gotten here?
oh , my god , that's ... the trap !
porcupine put this nut here on purpose .
how could the zone let us through?
oh god , i'm not going to take one more step until ...
i don't like it .
that's it !
we rest !
but keep off this nut , just in case .
sorry , but i thought that professor won't be able to make it .
you see , i ...
i never know beforehand what kind of people i'm taking with me .
everything gets clear only here , when it's too late .
what's important is that professor's bag with his underwear is safe .
don't stick your nose in someone's underwear if you don't understand it .
what is there to understand?
binomial theorem?
some psychological abysses !
you have a bad reputation at your institute .
they don't give you money for an expedition .
so you decide to pack a knapsack full of manometers and other shit ... penetrate the zone illegally ... and put all these miracles to an algebra test .
no one in the world has ever heard of the zone .
so we'll work a sure sensation !
the television , fans raving and bringing laurel wreaths .
mene mene , tekel , uprasin .
he deserves a nobel prize !
you lousy scribbler , a homespun psychoanalyst .
you're only good for painting walls in public toilets , you blabbermouth .
no good .
too sluggish .
you don't know how to do it .
all right .
i'm going to get a nobel prize .
and what are you after?
want to bless mankind with the pearls of your purchased inspiration?
i don't care a damn about mankind .
of all your mankind
i'm interested only in one man myself .
whether i'm worth anything or i'm just shit like others .
and if you find out that you're really ...
you know , mr. einstein , i have no wish to argue with you .
truth is born of argument , damn it !
listen , chingachgook ...
you've brought here many people .
not as many as i would like .
that's not the point .
why did they come here?
what did they want?
happiness , i guess .
yes , but what kind of happiness?
people don't like to speak about their innermost feelings .
and it's neither yours nor mine business .
in any case , you've been lucky .
as for me , i haven't seen one happy man in my life .
me neither .
they return from the room and i lead them back , and we never see each other again .
it's not that wishes come true immediately .
have you ever wished to use this room yourself?
i'm fine as i am .
