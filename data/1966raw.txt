gregorio .
gregorio !
they're all dead !
oh , god , they're all dead !
massacred !
the alamo has fallen !
they're dead , all of them !
they're all dead at the alamo !
did you hear what he said?
the alamo !
take the oath for militia duty , and you will receive 640 acres ... 640 acres of your own ... of your own choosing .
640 acres of your own choosing .
that's better .
smooth .
if it doesn't burn going down , how can you be sure it's bad for you?
i'll be interested to see you gentlemen when you arrive in texas and have your first taste of mescal .
is it true that men and women imbathe together out in the open?
cleanliness is next to godliness .
yes , well ... excuse us .
invest now , gentlemen , or lament later .
i'm a screamer .
i got the roughest racehorse , the prettiest sister , the surest rifle and the ugliest dog in the district .
my old man could lick anybody in tennessee , and i could lick my old man .
i can outgrin a panther and ride on a lightnin 'bolt , tote a steamboat on my back and whip my weight in wildcats .
whip my weight in wildcats .
whip my weight in wildcats .
whip ...
what is it?
he's here .
who's here?
he is here !
five minutes !
i'll tell you , these old bones could sure use a respite .
'course , the good citizens of tennessee may grant me that wish come next election .
no !
excuse me one moment .
yes .
yes , of course .
sam houston .
makin 'friends wherever you go .
to tennessee .
oh , to hell with tennessee .
to texas .
it's sad , isn't it?
a year ago , we'd be looking at two men with their caps set for the white house .
now ...
what you peddlin ', sam?
somethin 'a certain congressman might need before long .
are you sellin 'rockin 'chairs?
i'm sellin 'texas .
andwhatwould iwantwithnortemexico?
david , you remember what tennessee was?
you come to texas .
timber , water , game , cattle , more land than you can possibly imagine .
you take the oath for militia duty , you will receive 640 acres of your own choosing .
my own choosing?
mm hmm .
sam !
you figure this new republic's gonna need a president?
before we begin tonight's performance ,
i should like to acknowledge the presence of the man whose life inspired our humble play .
good evening , mr. crockett .
good evening , mr. crockett .
you want to call me an opportunist?
hell , yes , call me an opportunist .
but taking the alamo changed everything .
we're in control now .
yes !
we swore allegiance to mexico under the federalist constitution of 1824 .
santa anna tore that document up personally , did he not?
named himself supreme dictator?
well , i , for one , ain't swearin 'allegiance to no son of a bitch dictator .
yeah !
neither am l .
time to go , general .
they are talking crazy .
drunk back sober .
it's a miracle of the first order .
seguin , why'd they put me in charge of the army if they won't listen to me?
we need to muster and train troops here , not send soldiers all over texas .
idiots .
they think santa anna's just gonna hand over part of mexico without a fight?
they are gonna want you humble , general .
i humble myself before god , and there the list ends .
to march an expedition between here and matamoros
is lunacy !
you do not split an army into vagabond militias that march off on the slightest pretext like bloodthirsty rabble .
do you really believe this war is over?
you opposed bexar , but victory was ours !
yeah !
and now you oppose matamoros , where victory will be as sweet .
no .
perhaps , sir , you simply oppose fighting .
fighters shall lead the new country of texas , sir .
the council will now consider the removal of general houston from command of the regular army .
all in favor , show of hands .
aye !
the late , great sam houston , former governor of tennessee and now former general of the texian army .
scottish catamite .
what did you say?
i called you a scottish catamite , grant .
one step down from associate pederast .
all right .
remain clothed !
come for me !
come !
come !
any excuse to start removin 'your clothes , is that right , houston?
this is not your concern , mr. bowie .
indeed .
this is between me and the scottish catamite .
wanna borrow mine , grant?
'cause i'll surely give it to ya .
buy you a drink?
i didn't know you drank .
you marked the coat as single breasted , with a four inch stand collar?
as you desired , mr. travis .
lieutenant colonel .
and the epaulets are gold bullion?
should be quite a sight .
where would you like the uniform sent?
san antonio de bexar .
i'll be there defending the alamo .
defend against what?
the mexican army left there with their tail between their legs .
mr. william ... she here .
in your office , waitin '.
your wife .
mr. bowie !
colonel .
buck .
drunken hottentot .
two bit dandy .
well , the choices are abandonment , adultery , or cruel and barbarous treatment .
i think abandonment's most accurate .
any of the choices would be appropriate .
you sure you want to do this?
well , we we signed the papers .
i meant charlie .
i don't intend this harshly , but he should have a male example in his life .
i've already made arrangements for him to stay with a fine family while i'm away .
well , we have a long way to travel .
your father's becoming a rich man , and he'll be able to see to your education .
you're makin 'a jackass outta yourself , sam .
vindictive sons of bitches .
texas ... wasted on the texians .
they'll come back .
the mexicans .
a well trained army , against all this handful of amateurs .
only chance we have is to fight 'em out in the open .
forts , they're useless , useless to us .
what is it about that damn place , anyway?
what place?
the alamo .
every time a sour wind blows through , everybody runs there and hides inside .
ain'tnothin 'butmud .
acaved inchurch .
andcannon .
cannon .
protects my home , sam .
you don't have no home , any more than i have .
it's a damn shame about your wife , jim .
am i still your general?
you know you are .
i want you to return to the alamo , fetch the cannon back .
will you do that for me?
will you promise that you'll do that for me?
yeah .
now , you mind mr. and mrs. ayers .
don't go causing any fuss .
when i return , we'll get a home of our own .
i promise .
one crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name .
jim bowie's here !
know which one he is?
right there .
welcome to san antonio , bowie !
welcome home , jim .
welcome home , mr. bowie .
welcome home , jim .
you all right , mr. james?
i have a home .
sir?
we know you guys from somewhere?
whoo , that one's pretty dandy , that one .
halt !
have the quartermaster secure billeting .
yes , sir .
where you going , sir?
i'd like to see what i'm fightin 'for .
dismount !
it was founded as a mission 100 years ago .
the bexarenos called it the alamo , after alamo de parras , a spanish cavalry unit that moved in 30 years ago .
as you can see , it is not designed with military intentions .
she's well armed .
most cannon of any fort west of the mississippi .
i placed our largest , the 1 8 pounder , on the southwest corner , so it fronts the town .
the north wall is in ruins , so i have two batteries with five cannon to defend it .
what was the original convento is now barracks and a makeshift infirmary .
major jameson , our engineer , is emplacing a palisade between the main gate and the church .
what was here before?
nothing .
an indefensible flank .
it still appears indefensible .
good riflemen and a 12 pounder should hold it .
the church itselfwasn't built till 1 756 .
it has no roof .
was it destroyed in battle?
the catholics never quite finished it .
saints dominic and francis .
francis had two gifts : prophecy , and the ability to inspire passionate devotion .
this fort is the only thing that stands between santa anna's army and our settlements .
as goes the alamo ...
so goes texas .
if the need arises , i recommend you take my personal quarters on the west wall .
they're isolated , yet near the primary defenses .
i'm afraid i don't understand , sir .
i have personal matters to attend to in mina .
i'm leaving you in command .
i know you fought this posting , travis .
forting up is not exactly a cavalryman's dream .
i'll defend it with my life , sir .
your biggest task will be keeping the volunteers and the regulars from killin 'one another out of boredom .
the mexican army would have to cover 300 miles in the dead of winter to get here before i return .
i got one guy around my neck , i got another guy takin 'off half my ear
with his one good tooth .
the two that i knocked out are now wakin 'up , realizin 'who knocked 'em out .
but i'm fine .
i'm fine .
'cause i know i got my trusty , loyal ward right next to me .
so i turn over my shoulder , and who do i find?
tortilla lady and her 1 3 year old hound dog .
where were ya?
i hate to tell you this , jim , but you were in the wrong .
exactly .
that's when i need you the most .
oh , god .
i love this place .
i love it , too .
colonel?
you look terrible , almost yellow right around the cheeks and forehead .
you a doctor now , along with everything else?
i've heard rumor that you plan to destroy the mission and remove the cannon .
where'd you hear that?
men tend to prattle on when they drink .
your men tend to drink .
it would be a great mistake .
i agree .
and any further discussion on this will be between myself and colonel neill .
colonel neill left bexar this morning on personal business .
it's my command now .
well , my , my , my .
that is a swift rise , billy .
might as well break out those long britches .
your men exhibit no discipline .
if matters don't change , it will become my duty , as colonel of this post ...
lieutenant colonel .
restrain your men ... or i will .
? habla ingles . muchachos?
we got 'em , david .
it appears to me that we're all on the same side here .
what you doin 'out here?
my name is david crockett .
crockett of tennessee?
davy crockett?
he prefers " david .
now , there was this little detail of a re election back home .
aww !
it's all right .
it's all right .
'cause you know what i told them folks?
what'd you tell 'em?
i said , " you all can go to hell .
" i'm goin 'to texas !
yeah !
welcome to texas , davy .
thank you , sir .
put your mark on it , mr. crockett?
look out .
let me through here .
absolutely .
i'm half alligator , half snappin 'turtle .
i can slide off a rainbow and jump the mississippi in a single leap .
tell 'em , davy , how you can whup your weight in wildcats .
i seen you onstage .
well , that wasn't me .
why ...
why , sure it was .
no , sir , that was just an actor in a play .
he was performin 'a character .
aw , come on , davy .
say the lines .
davy crockett , the lion of the west .
i dare san tanna to show his face now you're here .
well , i understood the fightin 'was over .
ain'tit?
! alto !
! fuego !
well done .
you don't have the sand to even talk to two of my men , much less arrest them .
i told you i intended to restore order .
you've got no command over my volunteers .
none .
i have absolute command .
break 'em out , boys .
yeah .
'cause it's gonna be a cold day in hell anybody takes orders from a debtor who leaves his pregnant wife in the middle of the night .
how about a land swindler who marries a girl , god rest her soul , for her father's money?
whoa , whoa , fellers !
hey , hey , hey , fellers , now , listen .
just 'cause we ain't got nobody to fight don't mean we need to fight one another .
congressman crockett has a point .
we should do this democratically .
a vote .
what about colonel crockett leadin 'us?
no , i'm with you fellers , not above you .
all for the lieutenant colonel , raise your hand .
now , come on , men .
no repercussions .
all infavorofmecommanding .
andallforme?
all right .
you can command the militia only .
regulars can't be led by a volunteer .
it's illegal .
you don't like the outcome , you change the rule?
is that it , buck?
aw , don't fret about it , jim .
we all know who's in charge .
you know , i don't know why we had to tent up outside of town when there are so many fine houses with big corn husk beds just sittin 'empty .
why are they empty?
apparently some of the folks hereabouts seem to think the mexicans is comin 'back .
most of the boys think they wouldn't be here till late spring if they come at all .
figure they know something we don't?
mijito . cierre la puerta y ven para aca .
tell me what is going on !
we'll never be able to defend the town .
orderly withdrawal into the alamo .
greys fall in !
close up !
shoulder arms !
forward !
forward !
orderly withdrawal !
please proceed to the alamo in an orderly manner .
don't run .
you're fine .
almeron !
one , two , one , two .
almeronl susanna !
let's go , men !
come on !
follow me !
come on !
colonel?
i'm sorry to disturb you , but we got quite a mare's nest out here .
i have to get couriers out while there's still time .
you and your men will defend the palisade .
the palisade?
you talkin 'about that little old bunch of sticks over there?
you prefer a different assignment?
no , that's the one
i was gonna put in for .
if you could oversee manning the walls , it would be a help .
we should have six men to a cannon , 18 tubes , which works out to ...
108 men .
and we should have a man with a musket every four feet of wall .
we're gonna need more men .
! viva santa anna !! viva mexico !
to gonzales , and to colonel fannin at goliad .
godspeed .
sir .
colonel , you should see this .
we're gonna need a lot more men .
what is colonel bowie doing on the bridge?
tryin 'to talk us out of the spot we're in .
fire the 1 8 pounder .
sir?
you heard me .
fire the cannon .
prime the gun .
fire !
lo siento .
manuel .
i had nothing to do with this .
you out of your mind?
i'm trying to get us a truce !
a truce?
if we broker a cessation , we will do so from a position of strength , not weakness .
goddamn !
we don't turn belly up and beg .
otherwise , we have said nothing , and this conflict means nothing .
dyin'for nothin 'means shit to me .
their response?
shit !
david .
surrender at discretion ...
buck .
perhaps , colonel , they'll only execute the officers .
i think we all just got promoted .
looky here .
within a few days all of texas will know our situation .
tell me , buck , in alabama , precisely how many is " a few "?
no .
excelencia .
ah .
crockett?
si .
alteza . ! excelente !
you know , personally , david ,
i'd just as soon take my chances fightin 'out in the open .
hell , i don't like being hemmed in any more than you do , but here we sit .
avoid cluster at all times .
keep your eyes set for crossfire .
pack plenty of grease wrap balls , put 'em in your blocks .
you may be a firin 'fast , but not yet .
load all your muskets and stack 'em , but don't powder 'em .
ten minutes in this , they'll be nothin 'but sticks , understand?
oh ...
and nomoreofthis , byanybody .
go to it , boys .
here we go , sir .
come on , let me help you .
that's right .
take it in .
it burns .
but , sir ...
that's it .
i smell like a skunk's ass .
jim , what ails you , exactly?
consumption .
typhoid .
pneumonia .
one or all .
exactly .
she's a dandy , all right .
that knife fight you got into , sand bar over in natchez ...
it was the one that got you written up .
that all true?
you believe everything you read now?
i didn't read it , i heard it .
and the way i heard it , he put a sword cane and two shots in you .
i don't remember .
figure ol 'sam will be down here pretty soon .
when he gets here , we'll have a good ol 'time .
itwas three shots .
sword came through my lung and went through my hand , and then i cut his heart out .
those ain't bears out there .
do you understand that ...
davy?
why in the hell do you suppose they don't just attack us?
i seen vaqueros spend all day long just killin 'one bull .
you bring a band , you're countin 'on havin 'something to celebrate .
mighty nice of 'em to serenade us like this .
it's a cavalry march , but i'm told santa anna fancies it for other uses .
he borrowed it from the spaniards , the spaniards from the moors .
it's called " deguello . " kinda pretty .
deguello means " slit throat .
now , ain't that pretty .
get down !
get down !
! fuego !
! fuego !! fuego !
fire !
watch the north wall !
! fuego !! fuego !
keep your heads down , boys ! ! fuego !
! fuego !
! fuego ! ! fuego !
mornin '.
mornin '.
yes , sir .
lieutenant , check the main gate for me .
i need a head count for jim bowie .
yes , sir .
notice how you can't really hear it until it stops?
until they decide to attack , i suspect we'll be bombarded on a nightly basis .
deprive us of sleep .
they want you to start seeing ghosts everywhere .
colonel , i became a little heated with you in front of your men .
it was ill advised and not terribly professional .
don't worry about it .
most of my men didn't even understand the words you were usin '.
it's important that you and i agree .
for me , though we are poorly supplied , surrender is not an option .
i submit that we engage and delay until reinforcements arrive .
sometimes , it's just the way you say things , travis , that's all .
i swear to god .
bring it down !
down !
down !
down !
down !
down !
down !
to the left .
to the left .
in .
do you notice anything different about them cannon?
they moved 'em closer last night .
this will be the spot .
as our well is dryin ', anytime you find yourselves not busy with other matters ,
i need you to be diggin 'a new one here .
ain't bad enough we got to fetch 'em the water .
now we got to find it for 'em , too .
david , you said you wanted to see him .
there he is , the napoleon of the west .
which one?
that's santa anna?
yeah .
he's quite the peacock , isn't he?
wind kicked up .
! infanteria !
saquen sus canones .
! fuego !
go back !
take cover !
take that ball to captain dickinson .
we can reuse it .
you'll be pickin 'that up yourself .
well , i'll be .
cut it to shot and send it back to 'em .
yes , sir .
fire the cannon .
fire !
fire once from each cannon !
you heard the colonel .
lieutenant colonel , colonel .
you heard the man .
let's give 'em a taste !
let's give 'em hell !
come on , get up here !
andfire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
at this very moment our soldiers are held in the alamo against a force of thousands .
they put their hopes in colonel fannin . who . despite his pedigree . has proven himself ill equipped to lead . much less march . an army .
this is from colonel travis .
i call on you in the name of liberty to come to our aid with all dispatch .
lf this call is neglected ,
i am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier , who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country : victory or death .
gentlemen ...
i will raise an army .
we will relieve the alamo .
but only after we have declared independence and created a government that can be legally recognized by all the nations of the world .
that ... is what every besieged man in the alamo is fighting for .
we have no idea if any of our couriers made it out .
you know the land and the language .
you are asking me to leave my men .
i'm asking you to deliver a message to houston and return with a response .
i'm ordering it .
don't give him too much water .
he's just like me .
he drinks too much , he ain't worth a damn .
i'll bring him back to you , santiago .
you bring yourself back .
captain ... go with god .
makes a man ponder the possibilities , don't it?
what happened to your cap?
crawl away?
no .
i only wear it when it's extra cold .
the truth is ,
i only started wearing that thing ... because of that feller in that play they did about me .
people expect things .
ain'titso
can i ask you something?
all right .
now , which was tougher , jumping the mississippi or riding that lightning bolt?
can you catch a cannonball?
if it was just me , simple old david from tennessee ,
i might drop over that wall some night and take my chances .
but that davy crockett feller , they're all watchin 'him .
he's been on these walls every day of his life .
he's burning with fever .
try to get him to drink something not whiskey .
sam , get me some sheets and cold mud .
i have issued orders for colonel fannin to retreat from goliad .
john forbes is mustering more men throughout south texas and bringing them to gonzales .
i expect 1 500 men to be there when i arrive .
we will march out , circumventing santa anna's army , and relieve the alamo from the west , withdrawing back to the colorado and establishing on a line southeast from beason's crossing to brazoria .
you will have command of the regular army .
the militias will have their own command .
no .
i will command all or none .
you do your calling , and i shall do mine .
i will lead an army .
you will birth a nation .
gentlemen , to texas !
to texas !
here they come !
here they come !
position the cannon !
muster !
move back !
move back !
they're measuring our strength .
prepare yourselves .
fire at will , gentlemen !
captain dickinson !
aiml fire
run , you rabbits , run !
them jacales out there offer pretty good cover .
i wouldn't mind stretching my legs .
burn 'em down .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
get that first one , right there .
aghl
arrghl
what's your name , boy?
oh , yeah , davy .
thatta boy !
fine shootin ', boy .
muy bien .
muy bien .
muy bien .
watch the north wall !
over there .
what are they working at?
when they come over those walls ,
i want you to throw up your hands and holler ,
soy negro .
no disparo .
what's that?
mexican law said there ain't no slaves , right?
yeah .
and contract or no , that's what you is .
now , the mexicans see your color , you tell 'em , " don't shoot . " they pass you by .
but mr. william , he gonna give me a gun , and i'll ...
you clean up their shit , you take care of their horses , you wash 'em , you feed 'em .
damn if you ain't gonna die for 'em , too .
where is everybody?
30 men from here in gonzales have already left for the alamo .
assemblethementhatwehave .
we need more men .
if they arrive every day , soon we will have enough .
but for now , we wait .
if we can't run , we walk .
if we can't walk , we crawl .
but we gotta go to the aid of those boys .
it's only right .
general , i'm the man who left travis there .
i do not enjoy waiting any more than the next man , but i will not sacrifice texas .
these 1 24 men cannot pierce an army of thousands .
colonel fannin is en route from goliad with 400 men .
these troops need training .
i suggest that you commence with it .
