grrr !
that's them .
yeah .
molly's the big one .
the little one's her sister daisy .
the middle one's their cousin gracie .
well , what about the fathers?
moved on .
bring it here .
the next batch .
nothing out of the ordinary .
there's two applications for section 63 ex emptions .
police reports are there .
william harris is applying for permission to marry .
she's half caste also .
and mary wilson's applying for permission to visit her child at moore river .
she's quite agitated .
oh , and gladys phillips has written for permission to buy some new shoes .
she had a new pair a year ago .
er , now , this report from constable riggs about three little half caste girls at the jigalong fence depot molly , gracie and daisy .
the youngest is of particular concern .
she is promised to a full blood .
i'm authorising their removal .
they're to be taken to moore river as soon as possible .
oh , and miss thomas , if you could check that the rate for police transportation is still , i believe , eight pence per mile .
yes , mr neville .
thank you .
that country over there , that's wongi country .
you can't go there .
you get big trouble .
yeah , i know .
where your country?
my country?
down south .
long way from here .
our dad works there on the rabbit fence .
yeah?
how far does rabbit fence go to?
the rabbit proof fence?
it goes all the way to the sea down that way .
right to the top of australia .
longest fence in the world .
and all the way to the sea down that way .
1, 500 miles long .
keeps the rabbits on that side of the fence .
keeps the farmland on this side of the fence .
that molly's getting to be a big girl .
mr neville's been writing to me about those girls , you know .
frankie ...
come on , it's your turn .
come and get your rations .
hurry up .
come for the three girls , maude .
no !
this is my kids !
mlne !
it's the law , maude .
no !
got no say in it .
no !
mine !
move one inch and i'll lock your mother up !
neville's their legal guardian .
get away from us !
go !
no !
daisy !
give me back my daisy !
you sit up and you stay !
i've got the papers , maude !
don't take them !
no !
you've got no say in it !
no !
hear this don't move !
nothing you can do here , old girl !
nothing you can do .
leave them !
as you know , every aborigine born in this state comes under my control .
notice , if you will , the half caste child .
and there are ever increasing numbers of them .
now , what is to happen to them?
are we to allow the creation of an unwanted third race?
should coloureds be encouraged to go back to the black?
or should they be advanced to white status and be absorbed in the white population?
now , time and again , i'm asked by some white man ,
if i marry this coloured person ,
will our children be black?
and as chief protector of aborigines , it is my responsibility to accept or reject those marriages .
here is the answer .
three generations .
half blood grandmother .
quadroon daughter .
octoroon grandson .
now , as you can see , in the third generation , or third cross , no trace of native origin is apparent .
the continuing infiltration of white blood finally stamps out the black colour .
the aboriginal has simply been bred out .
now ... ... we come to ...
we come to the moore river native settlement .
ladies , most of you are familiar with our work here the training of domestic servants and farm labourers .
i would like to thank you for your continuing support .
hundreds of half caste children have been gathered up and brought here to be given the benefit of everything our culture has to offer .
for if we are to fit and train such children for the future , they cannot be left as they are .
and , in spite of himself , the native must be helped .
hello , there .
a ghost !
poor dears .

you must be exhausted .
come along i'll take you straight to the dormitory .

the tracker brought her back .
ah , yes , moodoo .
mr neal tells me that your probation period is up , and that you wish to return to the kimberleys , is that right?
of course , your daughter is here , isn't she?
there would be no question of her going .
she would have to stay here and continue her training .
i think for the time being , it would be best for all concerned if you were to remain here , moodoo .
i'd be prepared to consider your case in a year or so , but , er , until then ...
now , about those little ones from kalgoorlie .
those babies where their mothers?
they got no mothers .
nobody here got any mothers .
i got mother .

yes , i understand , but i require to be kept fully informed .
thank you .
goodbye .
those three girls , they've run off .
oh , dear .
probably the older one .
i wondered when i saw her .
too much of their mind ... ... unfathomable .
the tracker's onto it .
in the meantime , it must be kept out of the papers .
no rain , tracker gonna get us .
tracker's not gonna get us .
come on .
we gotta keep going .
come on , gracie .
daisy , give me your bag .

we don't know this place .
how are we going to eat?
shh !
run !
quick , hide .
come on .
ask them , molly .
ask them for something to eat .
hey , you from that moore river place , eh?
we're going home .
where your country?
jigalong .
jigalong?
proper long way .
do you know what you're doing?
that tracker from moore river ... ... he pretty good .
i heard he get them runaways all the time .
you've got to be good to beat him .
he'll take you back to that place .
here .
you watch out for him , eh?
you think you're so smart .
where are we?
we're lost .
jigalong that way .
north .
the tracker followed them to this riverbank but lost their tracks in the water about a week ago .
there's been no sign of them since .
three little half castes .
we're talking quite a few man hours here .
who's going to pay for it?
there's very little money in my departmental budget .
i'm hoping your men can combine this with their regular duties .
we'll be able to handle all the notifications , posting police stations , farms ...
we'll provide a description .
but if my men make trips outside their duties , it's an impost on your department , mr neville .
if your men are on other jobs , there is no extra expense .
i see that , mr neville .
every one of your men has a role as local protector .
my men will do their jobs , mr neville .
now , a week ago , you said .
yes .
hey , maude .
your girls have gone .
what did you say?
they've run away from moore river .
they're gone .
everybody's looking for them .
and what do you think you might be up to?
thieving my eggs , eh?
you come out here where i can see you .
come on .
stand up .
out you come .
and get rid of that bread .
it's filthy .
you want something to eat , you ask for it .
come on .
i'm not going to bite you .
are you on your own?
hmm?
got anyone with you?
there you are .
where are you girls planning on going?
cat got your tongue , eh?
now get !
go on .
and watch out for those boys further along .
they go out hunting rabbits along the fence .
that rabbit proof fence?
yes , the rabbit proof fence .
where that rabbit fence?
east .
which way now?
that way .
that fence .
find that rabbit fence , we go home .
then we see our mum .
the chief protector of aborigines , mr a. o. neville ...
the devil ! " ... is concerned about three native girls
ranging from eight to fourteen years of age
who a month ago
ran away from the moore river native settlement .
he would be grateful if any person ... who saw them
would notify him ... promptly .
we have been searching high and low for the children
for a month past , 'added mr neville .
and all the trace we found of them was a dead rabbit . " '
it's the fence !
it's the fence !
she found it !
now , the latest sighting which is four days old is ...
the man from the newspaper .
i have nothing more to say !
may i have a look?
dalwallinu .
yes?
bunnawarra .
yalgoo .
dalwallinu .
bunnawarra .
yalgoo .
dalwallinu , bunnawarra , yalgoo .
they're on the fence .
they're following the rabbit proof fence .
right .
just because people use neolithic tools , inspector , does not mean they have neolithic minds .
this makes our task very much easier .
look .
there's a branch off here to the west , north of yalgoo .
now , you put your man out here on the fence and north of this junction .
he can start to come down it to meet them .
i'll have moodoo come up from the south behind them .
we can't miss them .
where daisy?
wait here .
my legs , molly .
they hurt .
i can't walk .
i'll carry you only once , alright?
come on .
come on .
don't think i'm carrying you all the way .
camp , molly .
damn me .
where are you girls headed?
going to mullewa?
got family there?
where mullewa?
mullewa?
west .
the way you're headed along the number two fence .
are there two rabbit proof fence?
my oath .
we've got three of them .
we're on the wrong fence .
where the north fence?
north fence back that way where you come from .
you can cut across .
i'll show you .
number one rabbit fence .
here's the number two fence .
now , you're here .
but you want to be here .
now , if you cut across here ... ... you save yourself 100 mile or so .
it's not hard .
i'm going back .
i don't have the petrol .
hey , we're hungry .
are youse that lot from moore river?
yeah .
what you girls walk all that way?
yeah .
800 miles?
i was there .
too scared to run away , but .
everyone was always caught , stuck in that boob .
youse got the furtherest .
where you heading?
home .
mavis !
stay here .
i'll come back and get you .
sleep with me .
i'll get you some food .
just getting the washing , mrs evans !
shh !
what's that?
there's someone coming .
quick , quick , into bed .
hide under the blankets .
mavis .
go away .
don't worry about that !
come on , quick .
get up .
get up !
come on !
shh , shh , shh .
don't go , molly .
please don't go .
he come back if you go .
don't go .
he won't say anything .
please .
hello , evans .
hello .
mrs evans .
quick !
wake up .
wake up .
you got to go .
let's have a look .
out that way .
just keep going .
they were running out over there about an hour or so ago .
we'll pick up their tracks in the morning .
i'll make a cup of tea .
that's the tracker .
yeah , that's him .
hop on .
i do not expect you to understand what i am trying to do for these people .
but i'll not have my plans jeopardised .
the problem of half castes is not simply going to go away .
if it is not dealt with now , it will fester for years to come .
these children are that problem .
please explain exactly what happened .
i don't know how they did it , but we lost them .
i had larsen out there .
moodoo was with him .
they're making right fools of us .
they are indeed , inspector .
and the cost is more than to just our pride .
this department's reputation is beginning to suffer .
my men have better things to do than chase your charges all around the country .
now ... ... they're coming into very rough terrain .
once they're much past meekatharra ,
i can't risk any of my men .
yes , we must find them before they reach real desert country .
so this is what we're going to do .
you get your man up there .
moodoo can join him .
well up the fence around here .
far enough up so we know we cannot possibly miss them .
and i want them to stay there .
they can set up camp and wait .
costly .
well , we'll just have to bear it .
their lives may be at stake .
inspector , i understand the mother of one of the girls has gone to wiluna .
the children are headed into that country .
i want the word spread .
let's see what that does .
you wouldn't get me out there .
she's pretty clever , that girl .
she wants to go home .
good thing you kids ran into me .
a lot of people worried for you .
the police are up and down the country looking for youse .
it's in all the papers .
which one of you is gracie?
are you gracie?
i hear your mummy in wiluna .
you can catch a train there from meeka .
come on .
let's go .
wiluna is she at wiluna?
yes .
come on , gracie .
don't listen to him .
he's a liar .
maybe she there , molly .
maybe he telling the truth .
molly .
let's go to meeka , catch a train to wiluna .
if they see us , they'll catch us .
we can't stop now .
we must keep going .
we're nearly there .
but , molly , mummy there .
she at wiluna .
i want mummy .
come on .
come on , daisy .
come on , daisy .
you have to carry me , molly .
hop on .
she not coming .
don't look back .
don't look back .
she'll come .
higher .
you got them?
three !
one for you , one for me and one for both of us .
mmm !
come on , dais .
we've got to go back for gracie .
go !
what are you going to do sell the thing?
i've got her !
i want to get the train to mummy !
this is one of them .
she thinks her mummy's there .
gracie .
oi !
grab her !
hey !
gotcha !
you're not going anywhere .
now , get in that car now .
thanks , jacky .
there will be a shilling for you back at the station .
i'm taking you back where you belong .
she gone , molly?
she not coming back?
needle in a haystack .
well , that's it .
pack your stuff .
we're getting out of here .
they're only paying us for three weeks .
to constable riggs , police station , nullagine .
the two missing half caste girls , molly and daisy , are returning to jigalong via the rabbit proof fence , our efforts to apprehend them thus far having come to nought .
i therefore expect them to arrive in jigalong in about a month's time .
in your capacity as local protector , you are to proceed to jigalong to await their arrival and effect their recapture .
yours , etc .
no fence .
i want mother .
the fence will come back .
home .
it's coming through now .
riggs arrived jigalong .
awaits your instructions .
yes , there will be a reply .
please wait .
girl is to be sent south , via meekatharra ,
to be accompanied at all times .
awaiting notification .
what's all that about?
just some women's business .
been going on all day .
hey , molly .
yeah?
that tracker , he not going to get us now .
nah , he's not going to get us .
i'm not going to stay here .
i can feel it .
they're up to something .
i'm going to go take a look .
i lost one ... ... i lost one .
to constable riggs ,
police station , nullagine .
at present , we lack the funds to pursue the missing half caste girls ,
molly and daisy .
i would ask to be kept informed of their whereabouts , so that at some future date , they may indeed be ... recovered .
we face an uphill battle with these people ... ... especially the bush natives , who have to be protected against themselves .
if they would only understand what we are trying to do for them .
yours , etc .
thank you .
