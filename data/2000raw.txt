i found a paw print this morning and a cow has vanished .
that's mine .
this is the third night in a row .
all the villagers are scared shitless .
a monster .
yes . a big one .
a spirit's path inspired by the stories of noi inthanon
featuring banlop lomnoi & sakda kaewbuadee
once upon a time . there was a powerful khmer shaman . who could turn into various creatures .
he roamed the jungle and played tricks on villagers .
excuse me . is anyone up there?
who's there?
what are you doing here?
i came to fetch you .
my mother has a high fever .
don't come in the forest alone .
it's dangerous .
show me the way .
the hunter shot the tiger and trapped the shaman in the tiger spirit .
the tiger corpse is on display at kanchanaburi museum .
now every night . the shaman's spirit turns into a tiger to haunt travelers .
the villagers and their livestock have started to disappear .
hq . do you copy?
hq . do you copy?
as the tiger ghost tries to enter his dream . the soldier thinks about the missing villager .
the ghost is fascinated by the soldier's mysterious sound device .
hq . do you copy?
this is ekarat .
calling hq .
suddenly . a strange feeling gripped the soldier's heart .
soldier !
the tiger trails you like a shadow .
his spirit is starving and lonesome .
i see you are his prey and his companion .
he can smell you from mountains away .
and soon you will feel the same .
kill him to free him from the ghost world .
or let him devour you and enter his world .
wait for me .
once upon a time ...
there was a powerful shaman who could turn into animals .
a creature whose life exists only by memories of other .
and now ...
i see myself here .
my mother .
my father .
fear .
sadness .
it was all so real ... so real that ...
they brought me to life .
once i've devoured your soul .
we are neither animal nor human .
stop breathing .
i miss you ... soldier .
monster ...
i give you my spirit . my flesh ...
and my memories .
every drop of my blood .
sings our song .
a song of happiness .
there ...
do you hear it?
