we got to get back .
see ya , matt .
come through here .
strip down .
open up .
welcome to alcatraz .
inside b and c !
count them !
25 on inside c , first tier .
20 inside b , first tier .
23 on inside c , second tier .
17 inside b , second tier .
break out !
inside b and c.
move !
better button your collar , boy .
no forks .
hey , no forks .
do you see any?
fresh fish , you want your pasta?
hey , you want your pasta?
do you see any?
i see pasta in my sleep .
i'm litmus .
like litmus paper .
when it's cold , my face gets blue .
when it's hot , my face gets red .
inside c , move out .
warden wants to see you .
name?
morris .
that's funny .
this file says frank lee morris .
if you disobey the rules of society , they send you to prison .
if you disobey the rules of prison , they send you to us .
alcatraz is not like any other prison in the united states .
here , every inmate is confined alone to an individual cell .
unlike my predecessors , wardens johnson and blackwell ,
i don't have good conduct programs .
i do not have inmate councils .
inmates have no say in what they do .
they do as they're told .
you are not permitted to have newspapers or magazines carrying news .
knowledge of the outside world is what we tell you .
from this day on , your world will be everything that happens in this building .
you will shave once a day .
you will shower twice a week .
you will cut your hair once a month .
now , your privileges .
you can talk .
you can work .
other institutions hand out work , but here it's a privilege that you earn .
i promise you it's a privilege that you'll want .
visitors you're allowed two a month .
they cannot be former inmates of this or any other federal prison .
all names that you submit will be carefully checked by the fbl .
what names do you have in mind?
i can't think of any offhand .
family members?
none .
no family .
alcatraz is a maximum security prison with very few privileges .
we don't make good citizens , but we make good prisoners .
burglary , armed robbery , grand larceny ...
you've escaped from quite a few prisons , haven't you?
that's why you're here .
alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket .
i was specially chosen to ensure that the stink from the basket does not escape .
since i've been warden some have tried to escape .
most have been recaptured .
those who haven't have been killed or drowned in the bay .
no one has ever escaped from alcatraz .
and no one ever will .
you two go everywhere together?
sure .
even to bed together .
when i wash , he washes .
that way we sleep nice nice together .
capisce?
i'm wolf .
where did they transfer you from?
atlanta .
nice town , atlanta .
i never saw it .
i'm looking for a new punk .
good luck .
you don't understand .
i just found her .
why don't you show her what you can do?
morris , i need somebody in the library .
take him over there , will you?
yes , captain .
move .
what you want , boy?
the bull sent me down here to work .
can you read , boy?
as long as it's in the english language , boy .
you treat them all like wolf?
wolf wanted to get friendly .
i didn't .
you'll take that cart to the cells .
don't they let cons down here?
you see any chairs?
how come?
because this is the rock , man .
they don't want you doing anything here , but time ...
hard friggin 'time .
rock affects dudes differently .
it either brings out your strength , or it breaks you .
what did it do for you?
what happens when you get out?
i won't .
10 years ago ...
i was in this bar in alabama when two dudes started hassling me .
that was their first mistake .
they pulled knives .
that was their second mistake .
they didn't know how to use them .
that was the last mistake they ever made .
i got two 99 year sentences back to back .
seems like you could have pleaded self defence .
the dudes were white , man , just like you .
when i arrived they put me in one of those dark cells in d block .
after a while , i went stir crazy .
sliced my achilles 'tendon to get out .
you'll see why when you see d block .
tell me something , you through killing white guys?
why?
well , i don't know .
i just figured i wouldn't turn my back on you .
hey .
what's your name , man?
frank .
what's yours?
english .
see you later .
your name?
morris .
ok .
magazine or book?
where's english?
what did they do , give a nigger a nigger of his own?
magazine?
hi !
i'm bugsy .
magazine or book?
thanks .
hey , you're new .
yeah .
hey , wait , wait a minute .
i haven't seen a new guy in six months .
it's nice to talk .
how are the brooklyn dodgers doing?
moved to la two years ago .
no kidding?
warden don't allow books in these cells .
how come?
because there's no light in them .
better deliver them books , morris , where they can be read .
right .
what's the flower?
that's something inside me they can't lock up with their bars and walls .
i'm doc .
you ever paint?
no .
why not?
you scared of dying?
i don't think so .
you better be .
you hurt wolf .
wolf's going to hurt you .
where you going , cracker?
pete .
something special about those steps?
the higher you sit , the more status you got .
so we play king of the mountain , except here we don't play for fun , man .
and you're king?
yeah .
now , i figure there's two reasons why you didn't sit down on my step .
either you're too scared , or you just hate niggers .
now , which is it , boy?
you too scared?
i just hate niggers .
so no one's ever busted out .
no one's ever made it .
everyone has looked for a way , but there ain't any .
see those hacks?
most joints have one hack for every seven cons .
there's one hack for every three cons here .
you start shitting at night instead of in the morning , they want to know why .
let's say you're going to try it anyway .
first , you've got to get out of the cell .
each bar has six hard smaller bars set in a steel tube with extra steel poured in .
and there ain't no way to tunnel out , either .
shit .
this island is solid rock .
see that water?
it's over a mile swim to land .
the currents make it seem like 10 .
and the water's so cold it will numb your arms in minutes .
even if you are a good swimmer , you won't have time to make it .
there are 12 counts every day .
sometimes i think that's all this shit hole is , one long count .
we count the hours , the bulls count us , and the king bulls count the counts .
inside !
everybody in !
i'm assigning you a permanent job .
the carpentry shop .
it's a paying job .
how much?
15 cents an hour .
well , i always knew crime would pay .
it's a job .
see you later .
i sleep lousy , but i sniff the glue .
it passes the nights .
aren't you afraid they'll shake down your cell?
then i go to the hole .
it's worth the chance .
i guess anything you want bad enough is worth the chance .
including busting out?
hey , maybe there's a way out .
it's on top of your head .
yeah .
the ventilator shafts on top of our block .
how do you get on top of the block?
ask the bull for the key .
thanks .
hey , jive dude , where you going?
summer's coming on .
it's getting cooler .
weather here is as crazy as the rock .
maybe crazier .
mark twain wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in san francisco .
i can ...
wolf's coming at you .
is his hand cupped?
yes .
which one?
his right .
break off !
drop it , wolf !
drop it , wolf .
you like d block , wolf?
you better , because you're gonna rot there for a long time .
d block , morris .
look , he came at me .
i said d block .
when i get out , you're dead .
you'll be dead before you get out .
warden don't like inmates fighting .
don't like 'em stinking up their cells , either .
lights out !
go on back to your cell .
welcome to alcatraz .
hey , is anybody over there?
yeah , me .
come out in front and say hello .
busy .
how busy can you be in one of these closets?
don't worry .
i washed it .
how you doing , neighbour?
i'm charley butts .
smallest cell i ever been in .
you'll get used to it .
i don't think so .
i don't like living alone here .
you'll get used to that , too .
break out !
yard time !
button the collar .
who's the new fish?
i got him next to me .
what's your name?
charley butts .
charley's butt?
butts .
butts .
charley butts .
you got a funny name , kid .
yeah?
what's your name?
al capone .
thought you were dead .
me?
i got too much money .
i'll never die .
you play poker?
not much .
i just learned myself .
we'll play tomorrow .
see you later , kid .
see you later , al .
i don't believe i just met al capone .
i don't , either .
i'm doc .
charley butts .
how's the painting going , doc?
the one of the warden?
it's nearly finished .
you painting the warden?
he's very inspiring .
inside .
everybody in .
yes , sir?
i want painting privileges taken away from chester dalton .
doc?
cell 233 .
what's the reason?
you're deputy warden .
you think of one .
when do you want the suspension to begin?
it's not a suspension .
it's an elimination .
right away .
yes , sir .
painting privileges have been removed .
why?
i don't know .
painting's all i have .
i'm sorry , doc .
you ok , doc?
i think there's something wrong with him .
i'd keep my eye on doc .
he seems pretty upset .
cons are always upset about something .
put your overalls on .
mr zimmerman , i'm making a new table .
i need a hatchet .
bob , get doc a hatchet .
mr zimmerman !
can you come over here for a minute?
get him out of here !
get him out !
take him out of here !
get him out !
get back to work .
let's go !
move !
everybody , back to work !
let's go !
here .
put that in your report .
what were you doing back there , boy?
how about a magazine?
why not?
what do you want?
boy's life?
i know some queens who fight over it every month .
just give me what you got on top there .
i heard about doc , and i know why he did it .
somebody took away his painting privileges .
who?
the warden .
morris .
i hear there was an accident in one of the shops .
accident?
you mean doc .
yeah , someone didn't like what he was painting , so someone won't let him paint .
someone should have warned doc to be careful what he paints .
i think you're absolutely right , sir .
there's always the possibility that some asshole will be offended , isn't there?
we all have to be careful .
back in line .
hey , how's it going , frank?
well , well .
if it isn't the anglins .
what are you guys doing , just dropping by?
thought we'd pay you a visit .
gonna stay long?
not long .
only about 15 or 20 years .
why the rock?
we were leaving atlanta when we encountered a minor problem .
such as?
they saw us .
yeah , that do present problems .
they shipped us to leavenworth .
but we didn't like their accommodations , either .
warden said he knew just the place for us ...
alcatraz .
is it true no one's ever bust out of here?
so they tell me .
jesus .
wonder what i'd be like after 15 years here .
you still reading that bible?
yeah .
it's opening up all kinds of new doors .
i turned 35 today .
some birthday .
when's your birthday?
i don't know .
jeez , what kind of childhood did you have?
short .
i always wanted to see san francisco .
never thought it'd be like this .
what'd you get sent to the rock for?
couple of years ago i started stealing cars , for kicks mostly .
i'd sell the parts .
got sent to the state pen .
you end up in alcatraz for that?
not exactly .
a bull there liked to push me around .
so when i got out , i went back , and stole his car .
unfortunately , i drove it across the state line , which made it a federal rap , and i was sent to the rock .
english !
visitor for you .
butts , you got a visitor .
me?
yeah , you .
probably somebody wants their car back .
hello , father .
why didn't you say you were coming?
i was afraid you wouldn't let me .
it's just hard to see you like this .
your mama's going to die .
charley?
when?
well , she's got a few months .
can you call her?
we're not allowed to make phone calls .
you cannot discuss institution rules .
stick to your personal life .
this is my personal life !
you getting a kick out of it?
hello?
hello !
i ... love ... you ...
charley .
hey , frank .
yeah?
if you try to get out , i want in .
must be wednesday .
why?
mystery mounds .
we always have mystery mounds on wednesday .
i can't taste it .
i just eat it out of habit .
what's the movie this weekend?
some cowboy piece of shit .
hey , at least they could show us a gangster movie .
i may have found a way out of here .
you looking at something?
this cell block's really getting old .
the moist air corrodes the concrete .
the salt is rusting the metal .
i took a nail clipper , and dug around the grille at the back of the cell .
i can dig that grille out , and enlarge the hole into the utility corridor to the top of the cell block and maybe onto the roof .
how will we hide the hole?
we tear the ads from magazines ... no one will miss those ... make cardboard , paint grilles on that , and put it in the hole , maybe partially obscure it with a towel or whatever .
i've ordered an accordion to put in front of my hole .
suppose we make it .
they'll know we're gone at the next count .
we'll leave at night , so they won't know till the morning .
we'll have to make some dummy heads , make them out of plaster or cardboard or whatever .
put them in the bunks , the guards won't know .
you work in the barbershop .
you get the hair .
how do we cross the bay?
that's your job .
you work in the clothing shop .
you're gonna steal some raincoats and some contact cement .
we'll make a life raft and some life preservers .
i read how to do it in popular mechanics .
they'll think we're going to frisco .
well , we won't .
we'll go to angel island instead .
what about me?
you'll stand guard while i dig .
i'll stand guard while you dig .
you two trade off the same way .
what are our chances?
slim .
i'm in .
me , too .
i wanna go .
charley .
yeah?
i'm gonna start digging .
keep an eye out .
if you see one , start whistling , huh?
how's it going?
fair .
whoever named this place the rock wasn't kidding .
working with those nail clippers just doesn't have any grip .
hey , guard .
yeah?
can i exchange this spoon?
looks like it's been in someone's ass .
and i want to work in the kitchen .
go ahead .
thank you .
i'd like to join the kitchen detail .
can you cook?
can i swap this spoon for another?
damn right i can cook .
i used to be a cook in this caf .
everybody loved my meatballs .
did you quit or get fired?
neither .
i robbed the caf .
heard you had a visitor .
my daughter .
she's getting married .
he's white ... just like you .
congratulations .
want a magazine?
yeah .
what do you recommend?
ebony .
hey , english .
is it possible to weld two pieces of metal together here in the cell?
for digging ... or sticking?
digging .
it ain't easy , but i could show you .
planning on going somewhere?
there hasn't been a day that i've been on this rock that i didn't think of busting out .
if i'd known , i'd have slashed my throat instead of my tendon .
hey , litmus , can you get me a dime?
no problem .
cost you 10 desserts .
i need it tonight .
no problem .
cost you an extra five .
get me a dime , i'll toss in 10 beetles for your mouse .
thanks .
hey , frank , what's burning?
if you see one of those bulls coming , just start whistling .
hey , spoof , what's for breakfast?
i smell something burning .
i don't smell anything .
hell , must be my imagination .
working nights really gets to you after a while .
try it from my side .
keep an eye out .
he may be back .
the grille's welded on two hook anchors?
if i get a wedge i may be able to knock those anchors loose .
this might just be what i'm looking for .
but it won't get through the metal detector .
yeah , i know .
morris , hold it .
i made it for a clothes peg .
why the metal over the edge?
so the clothes would slide off easy .
i don't believe you .
i didn't try to hide it .
why would i try to take metal through a detector?
because you're stupid .
move it .
open up 107 .
why did you order this stuff?
you don't look like a painter .
you wouldn't know talent if it looked you in the face .
i'm looking you in the face and i don't see shit .
hair .
your colour .
frank .
paint .
one of them's flesh coloured .
what are you painting?
i don't know .
the ocean maybe .
if you're using flesh coloured paint , you better paint a portrait .
yeah .
frank .
frank .
morris go to sleep early tonight?
yeah .
wasn't feeling well .
he must sleep pretty soundly .
he hasn't moved .
morris?
yeah , what's up?
i went up top last night .
i saw the ventilator shaft to the roof , but i can't reach it .
i need a boost .
how are you all coming?
my dummy's ready .
the hole's done , but i'm just starting the dummy .
i ain't doing too good .
tonight , john and i will go up .
you get those raincoats , might as well start hauling them up .
i'll wear one back from the shop each day .
there's a different hack there in the afternoon .
he'll think i wore it to work .
can you get that contact cement?
i keep inventory .
hey !
give me a boost .
the bars feel pretty solid .
there seems to be a metal hood riveted onto higher uprights .
we'll spread the bars with a pipe and knock the hood off .
there's an electrical outlet here .
get a motor , a drill bit and a flashlight and we'd have it all .
great .
where's the nearest hardware store?
can you get me an extension cord and a drill bit from the shop?
if they find out , i go to the hole .
all right , but from now on , you put your desserts onto my tray .
time's up .
back to the cells .
damn it !
just when i thought we was doing good .
i can use this .
are you crazy?
hold it , morris .
want to look at one of those cases .
try this one .
let's open it up .
stole this penlight from the doc .
hey .
give me a boost .
pipe .
ok .
hand me the drill .
we're all through .
fire !
hey , 50 millimetre guns .
i'm worried about the shakedowns .
my cardboard grille keeps slipping out .
put some contact cement around the edges .
that should take care of it .
how's the raft and the life jackets coming?
ok .
i think they'll be done tuesday .
tuesday night , we go .
what's that for?
just thinking about doc .
yeah .
we planted those chrysanthemums 15 years ago .
they meant a lot to doc .
to me , too .
i had a garden .
what'd you grow , weeds?
it's against regulations , morris , and you know it .
stretcher .
get the medic .
he won't need one .
some men are destined never to leave alcatraz ...
alive .
got those books that may help you .
thanks .
see you later , man .
goodbye ... boy .
so long ... boy .
shakedown .
move .
move , move , move .
take a seat .
been playing this thing long?
couple of months .
you any good?
terrible .
you'll get better .
excuse me .
that's one of the benefits of alcatraz .
lots of time to practise .
has morris been doing anything unusual?
sometimes he stays up late talking with butts .
split them up .
move morris .
i'll have to get a cell ready and do the paperwork .
do you?
yes , sir .
we could move him , say , wednesday .
tuesday morning .
yes , sir .
i missed you , morris .
i missed you so much , i got a present for you .
i'll give it to you ... later .
get your ass back there .
he'll kill you , or you'll have to kill him .
well , i'm not going to give him the chance .
can you get the raft and life jackets ready by tonight?
all right .
we'll meet on top as soon as the lights are out .
wolf , you carrying?
who , me?
move out .
where you going , wolfie?
i'm just going for a walk .
let's take that walk .
after six months in the hole ,
looks like you could use some exercise .
butts .
i'll meet you up on top .
let's go .
yeah .
you're going , too .
butts .
butts , god damn it .
can't risk tearing this gear , what's left of it .
throw me the stuff when i get over .
watch the barbed wire .
get up , morris .
it's moving day .
i said , get up , morris .
open up 109 .
god damn it , morris .
i said get ...
jesus christ .
morning , sergeant .
what have you got?
photos and a notebook of clarence anglin's .
funny looking bag .
must have been made from a raincoat .
it appears that they drowned .
why?
if that was important they wouldn't have lost it .
maybe they lost it to look like they drowned .
warden , i just got a message from the director .
he wants you in washington .
do chrysanthemums grow on this island?
not here on angel island .
why?
i'm curious .
the tides were mild and the fog light last night .
if they left at lights out , they had a 9 1/ 2 hour head start .
i wonder if they made it .
they drowned .
yes , sir .
a massive search was conducted for frank morris , john and clarence anglin .
law enforcement agencies were certain they would find the bodies .
they never did .
alcatraz was closed less than a year later .
