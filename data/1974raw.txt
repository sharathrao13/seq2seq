we're on the red carpet tonight for the premiere of adrenaline force .
this is bo laramie's breakout role ... in what is certain to become a very popular action franchise .
take a look at the crowd behind me .
they have been completely ignited by the anticipation of laramie's arrival .
oh , my god , this is huge , babe .
it's a long way from pounding nails in buildings .

no , son .
i don't know any of 'em .

what a night .
unreal .
six months ago , i couldn't get arrested with a fresh corpse and a smoking gun .
and today i'm the , uh , " it " guy?
but you can't buy into that .
that's an illusion .
that's not real .
you know , there are primitive tribes that believe ... you lose a piece of your soul every time your picture's taken .
after last night , it's a wonder i have any left .
bo laramie .
hold that thought .
it is !
oh , my god !
that's him !
that never happened in high school .
never .
that's an illusion .
it's not real .
life is good .
i guess i'm just gonna keep doin 'what i'm doin '... until somebody figures out i really don't know what i'm doin '.
yeah , you know , that makes sense .
that sounds like a plan .
hey , buddy .
hey , dad .
what's up?
mom says you run so you won't get fat .
is that true?
is that what she said?
really?
well , you know what?
your mother's right again .
that's it .
everything we have fits in half a cabinet .
i love this house .
you sure it's ours?
it's ours , beautiful .
it's ours .
how was your run?
good enough that the fat man and his family can go get some muffins on the way to soccer .
muffins !
did you give our secret away?
yeah .
no !
okay , i'm gonna put you in the cabinet .
hey , bo .
how are you , sierra?

there are so many creeps out there .
i ...
he's a minor .

i'm gonna call gill , and i'm gonna find out .
all right?
god , bo .
my principal , the teachers .
my kids 'parents .
what are they gonna think?
i'm sorry you're being put through this , abby .

only one thing matters , right?
i know , dad .

okay .
i'll be right back , sweetie .
hey .
how you doin ', bo?
all right .
what are you doin '?
i'm about to watch a soccer game .
how's zach doin 'this morning?
he's a good lookin 'boy .
he's got a birthday comin 'up , doesn't he?
you want to take a picture of me?
i'm right here , okay?
take a few shots .
'cause you had no right taking pictures of my son .
that's a point of law , mr. laramie .
i have every right to take pictures of whoever i want in a public park .
yes , i do .
not without my consent you don't , all right?
now , come on .
look .
things have changed .
you're somebody now .
you better get used to this .
oh , yeah?
i'm somebody now?
yes , you are .
you're somebody now .
now your game's about to start .
it's a security risk .
i'm asking you nicely , and i'm saying please .
don't take pictures of my son .
okay .
okay .
you got it , bo .
thank you .
i appreciate it .
i understand .
sure thing , famous guy .
good job , buddy .
you were awesome .
thanks , mom .
i'm proud of you , son .
you did a great job , buddy .
you did a great job .
son of a bitch .
take him to the car .
bo !
what did i tell you?
i said don't take another goddamn picture of my family .
you understand that?
not one more .
yeah?
kid takes a nice picture .
won't bring half as much as the ones i have of abby changing zach's clothes .
the steamy ones ... by the pool .
oh , yeah?
huh?
is that bo?
oh , are you gonna pay .
smile , bo .
you get that?
ooh , in living color , chief .
cops are on their way .
bo !
hey , bo .
hey , big shot !
enjoy what's left of your weekend .
let's go make some money .
oh , yeah? huh?
wow .
we're told laramie was released late saturday afternoon ... ordered to attend anger management classes ... as part of a plea agreement .
his people tell us the assault charges will likely be dropped ... in lieu of a settlement that could easily cost ... the rising star half a million dollars .
the victim , 34 year old rex harper ... is also demanding a public apology .
our very own giuliana caught up with bo ... on the set of his new action movie .
giuliana?
thanks , patrick .
and thank you for agreeing to sit down with me .
thanks for having me .
bo , just so we understand what happened ... you became angry at some photographers ... after they were taking pictures of you at a weekend soccer game?
mr. harper was taking pictures of my son .
i politely asked him to stop , and he didn't .
so you hit him?
well , there's a little bit more to it than that , but , yeah .
this guy is nothing but a low class parasite .
your parasite's right here .
he's never gonna get an apology from me .
and if he knows what's good for him , he'll stay away from me and my family .
can you believe this prick?
strong words .
yeah .
yeah .
i gotta go .
laramie , i'm gonna destroy your life and eat your soul ... and i can't wait to do it .
well , here's one for ya .
you're lucky .
real lucky .
a judge orders me to spend $400 an hour on therapy ... that i don't need , and that makes me lucky?
you're lucky you're not in jail .
you're not in montana anymore , bo .
anger management is not about upgrading from a 20 to a 12 gauge .
the point is ... you're carrying belief systems from a previous life ... that don't fit your new reality .
some of your old values may not be valuable anymore .
not here , not now .
well , i disagree .
you don't mess with a man's family .
and i'm not gonna change who i am ... to suit my environment or your expectations .
i got to where i am by doing things my own way .
oh , i think the judge would agree with you .
that's not what i meant , but ...
no , i know that .
look , your , uh ... your time here ... it's gonna give you the tools to better deal with situations like last saturday's .
and i'm considerably cheaper than mr. harper .
all right .
is that it?
for now , yes .
and , uh , if you have a problem , i want you to call me .
all right .
thank you .
i'll see you next week .
thanks , phil .
clear .
must be cold as hell this time of year .
huh?
switzerland .
what do you mean?
it says here ...
this came out of the u. k. , so it must be true ... " unnamed sources say ...
laramie chartered a private jet to switzerland .
while there the young star reportedly underwent a penile enhancement ... surprising his wife with it on her birthday .
nice , huh?
you give it a name?
big bo "?
the albatross "?
something sexy for the bedroom , to keep it fun .
i'm going to .
bo , can we get you for a lineup in here?
yeah , yeah .
yeah , no problem .
it's nice , how they caught me .
yeah .
y you want to show it to me?
can't keep anything a secret these days .
you got the work done , you might as well let people see it .
if it's big like that , w why would you want to hide it?
be nicer to him .
things have changed around here .
take a look .
oye .
amigos .
you got the stuff , huh?
s .
thank you .
muchas gracias , amigos .
merci .
sure , man .
pinche americano , est loco .
este buey est zafado .
nice legs .
what time do they open?
does that usually work where you come from?
yeah , a couple of times .
leave !
now !
can you believe that guy?
i thought he was kind of cute .
loser .
and you're considering this?
all i'm saying is they called .
those schmucks over at web pics are turning this friggin 'business into a trout farm .
celebrities getting approval over paparazzi's photos?
that's bullshit !
the public wants raw and real , and that's what we give them .
let me tell you something , my friends .
we're the last of the real hunters .
i'll drink to that .
like those shots you got of lopez .
now , they were the shit .
and you are a dog .
damn straight .
i made bank on 'em too .
i spent three nights hidin 'in that tree .
ants crawlin 'all over my ass .
i picked her off with a thousand mil from 120 yards out .
it was beautiful .
yeah .
too bad it wasn't really lopez .
nobody knows that .
let me tell you something , kevin .
don't start sweatin 'the small stuff , okay?
or you'll get soft , end up like the rest of those pussies working at the agencies .
hey , i'm here , ain't i?
hanging with you and rex , who is , by the way , still the king .
hundred and five thousand dollars for that shot of clooney in the woods .
ohh hoo .
yeah , clooney's been a real gold mine .
how'd it go , huh?
she's a lesbian .
really?
i'm gonna get a second opinion .
god , you get a lot of lesbians .
let's go .
excuse me .
buy you another round?
yeah .
hey , dan ...
dana .
i guess you can afford it .
what's that supposed to mean?
you think i wouldn't recognize the guy ... that siphoned half a million dollars out of bo laramie?
hey , i saw you get your ass kicked on tv .
look , i'm a photojournalist .
i was doing my job .
mm hmm .
i was assaulted , and justice was served .
with the exception of laramie's apology to me .
i like reading the tabloids .
i think they're fun .
i think you're drunk .
i think you're cute .
your pictures hurt people .
do they?
the irony ...
marcy .
marcy ... is everyone wants to have steak , but nobody wants to date the butcher .
my job is to provide a window of reality for society .
it's up to them whether they want to look through it or not .
come on .
have you ever bought a tabloid?
guilty as charged .
don't feel guilty .
guilty's bad .
i mean , everyone wants to have a ...
little peek , huh?
see?
it's human nature .
look , there's a ... there's a premiere tonight ... and an after party i'm covering .
come with me , as my guest ...
come with me , as my guest ... and , um , see things from an entirely different perspective ... mine .
hey , do a shot with me and then tell me your story .
i'm a good listener .
really?
uh huh .
listen to this ...
no .
what do you say , marcy?
you want to have a little adventure?
it's beautiful .
you should come and see it .
yeah?
so , when ...
saturday , can you come?
or ...

you want to tell me what's bothering you , honey?
i just think it's interesting , that's all .
you were in london last spring .
right .
my girlfriends at home get jealous ... if somebody winks at their husband at the company christmas party .
half the civilized world wants my husband .
how do you think that makes me feel?
you know what that guy said tonight is bullshit , right?
yeah , i know .
okay .
i guess it's all just new to me , you know?
it's new to me too , honey .
and i'm ...
you know , every day i'm learning .
abby !

i had to remove her spleen .
the next few weeks will be very difficult , bo .
she'll be in a lot of pain .
we'll manage that with medication , watch her very carefully .
now , let's talk about your little guy here .
he's stable .
his vitals are good .
but comas are a tricky thing , bo .
all we can do is wait .
okay .
can we be left alone?
absolutely .
thank you , doctor .
daddy !
you taped me?
mm hmm .
the wine ...
you mu ...
you must have put something in it ...
obviously it made you quite amorous .
it's a shame , marcy , you don't remember it .
still going to the police to tell them who caused laramie's accident?
think again !
not only will i attach that to every porno site on the internet ...
i will make sure it finds its way to your father's desk at the state department .
you wouldn't ...
you wouldn't do that .
you don't see my face on that screen .
do you , marcy?
now go ... go to the police !
see if i'm bluffing !
get out of my goddamn house !
get out of here .
hey there , little guy .
i'm gonna come back and see you every day , okay?
it's okay , honey .
he can hear you , sweetie .
all right?
okay .
one second , honey .
i'm gonna go out and talk to the detective .
i'll be right back .
honey , wake up and you can have whatever you want .
hi , bo .
how are you , detective?
i tracked down those paparazzi guys you told me about .
brought 'em in one at a time .
they all came up with the same story .
oh , yeah?
what story's that?
well , they never deny following you .
they say they drove up on the accident ... called 911 and never left until help arrived .
detective , that's bullshit .
you hear me?
come on , man .
give me a break , will ya?
i'm just tellin 'you what i got .
until i find someone who saw somethin 'different , that's all i have .
what about the , uh , other driver?
he died late last night .
he never regained consciousness .
i'm sorry , bo .
but listen , if there's a witness out there , i'm gonna find him .
believe me .
i'm all over this one , bo .
i appreciate it .
the victim died , bo .
what now?
did you mean to kill him , bo?
nice driving .
stellar agency .
please hold .
that's for pickup , sara .
bo , taking these paparazzi to court is only gonna cause more headlines .
let it go .
we've got bigger problems to deal with .
the studio says we get back to work or they will be forced to shut down the picture .
five weeks , bo .
they're losing a tremendous amount of money .
the bond company is now threatening to go after you .
and your production company .
technically , you weren't hurt .
what'd you say?
uh , bo , you're upset .
you don't know shit .
i'm sorry .
so , what do you want us to do , bo?
and that's a cut .
excellent !
well done .
whoo .
way to do it .
way to do it .
you all right?
yeah .

that's a wrap , everybody .
we'll pick it up here tomorrow morning .

mr. laramie?

i'll be on set for the rest of the show .
well , i could use you .

just pull me up !
pull me up .
come on .
pull me up .
hurry !
pull me up !
now !
now !
i'm startin 'to feel much more in control of my anger .
well , that's quite a leap in progress .
especially considering your recent tragedy .
yeah .
well , i can't let the fact that four paparazzis nearly killed my family ... affect my behavior , now , can i?
what do you mean by that , bo?
well , you asked me to work on something , and , uh , i did .
well , surely you must have some feelings about what happened .
i feel cheated .
i'm angry .
blessed .
all at the same time .
what's this?
a journal .
i want you to start recording specific events that prompt your anger ... and how you dealt with them in the moment .
doing this will help you put a face on your problems .
my problems already have faces , dr. kelley .
well , then you're moving in the right direction .
let this journal become a sanctuary for you , bo .
my clients are having great success with it .
really?
this shit happens way too often .
this kid never even hit the brakes .
this guy ain't no kid .
he's close to 40 .
they call 'em rolex riders .
they hang out in beverly hills , wear expensive leathers .
same guy cuts all their hair .
pity .
he was cute .
hey , fellas .
detective burton , s. i. s.
you boys mind if i sniff around?
knock yourself out , detective .
hey , why's special investigations ... sending a d 2 down to a traffic accident?
well , i heard your victim's name on the radio .
he was part of a case that i've been working on .
it's probably nothing .
i just thought i'd look around .
here you go , sweetie .
thank you .
sure .
anything else?
mm mmm .
i'm fine .
okay .
one second .
all right?
hello .
oh , hi , bo .
it's detective burton .
hey , detective .
i hope i'm not bothering you .
no , no , no .
we just got back from the hospital .
any change?
no , no .
no change .
but thanks for asking .
so , what's up?
well , you remember that guy kevin rosner?
he was killed earlier today in a motorcycle accident .
the ...
the name sounds familiar .
wh ...
he was one of the photographers that was involved in your accident .
oh .
well , that's too bad , isn't it?
i just thought you'd like to know .
yeah , well , i appreciate you calling .
okay .
bo !
all right .
okay .
chrissy !
hey , baby .
hey .
what do you got?
just like i expected .
cops refused to release kevin's personal effects .
then what are we doin '...
would you let me finish?
i said i expected it .
so i slapped 'em with a bogus power of attorney .
they didn't have any choice .
ready for the good news?
cheryl .
do you mind , love?
check this out .
kevin !
even in death , they can't shut him up .
hey , cheryl .
call richard .
tell him to hold the cover .
hello , debra .
can you get me through to richard?
we got something here .
we need to speak with him now .
bo?
bo !
howdy .
hey , detective .
how are you?
good .
how you doin '?
okay .
good to see you .
yeah , things are good .
you want a cup of coffee?
i'd love one .
thanks .
let's take a walk .
i'll show you around .
okay .
listen , the other day after i hung up with you i did some digging around .
we're dealing with real scumbags here , bo .
this guy ...
leonard clark?
he used to be an attorney .
he got himself disbarred for distribution of narcotics .
is that right?
what do you think the son of a bitch does?
he turns around and sues the police department for illegal search and seizure .
cost the city a million bucks just to make it go away .
he's still on probation for possession of illegal firearms .
really .
and this other guy ...
harper?
the guy you slapped around?
he slimed his way out of an attempted rape charge .
guess who the attorney was .
leonard clark?
yeah .
and by the way , you're not the first deep pockets he got into .
this actor , andy baldwin?
alec?
yeah .
one of those baldwin guys .
anyway , he slaps harper around .
harper takes him to the cleaners ... and then harper moves into a boat in the marina .
now , listen , bo ... until i get this thing straightened out ...
i know that you actors have people and places you wanna keep confidential .
right .
if i were you , i would be very careful about what i said on my cell phone .
really .
why's that?
because for a couple hundred dollars ... you can go to your local radio guy ... and you can drop in on anybody at any time .
bo , we're ready for you on set .
okay .
listen , detective , thanks for coming by .
i appreciate it .
i'll speak to you soon .
okay?
thank you .
thank you .
i'm scared for zach .
i ...
part of me just wants to take him back to montana where he can feel secure .
i don't think he's gonna get that here .
hey , reg .
where you at , man?
yeah , i just got here .
nicole kidman's coming by for a lunch meeting .
i'm on it .
see you in a sec .
you hear that , leonard , you piece of shit?
sorry , man .
can't let you slide .
mr. laramie's orders .
do you mind?
yes , i do .
what's going on , reg?
uninvited guest .
oh , yeah?
i don't see anybody hurt or naked .
you sure you're in the right place , leonard?
very funny .
ha ha ha ha .
get rid of him , reg .
you heard him .
don't touch me !
i'm leaving .
emergency response .
listen , there's a guy with a blue metallic volvo station wagon ...
he's waving a gun all over the place !

it might be a while .
we're running a little behind .
i have script changes for you , and there's a detective burton here .
i told him he could wait in your trailer .
he's in my trailer?
thanks .
oh , hiya , bo .
hey .
that little girl outside , she said it was okay ...
no , no , of course .
how's it going?
oh , good .
geez , look at this place .
it's amazing .
my kids will not believe this .
you got kids , huh?
yeah .
really?
how many kids you got?
six girls .
six girls?
wow .
i kept trying for the boy , but ...
it sounds like it .
well , i guess you know why i'm here , bo .
it's pretty hard to miss .
so you know what i'm talking about?
leonard clark , no?
can you believe this guy?
he pulls a gun on half of our department .
well , the guy's a bit of a jerk .
come on .
hey .
sorry to interrupt , bo .
no , it's all right .
okay , here you go , detective .
this is a copy of the paperwork we gave to the a. t. f.
well , thank you , charlie .
thank you very much .
i'll stop by on my way out .
all right .
oh , yeah , we traced the gun here .
charlie reported it missing .
you know leonard clark was here that day , right?
i heard that .
bo ...
i've now got two dead paparazzi ... that were involved in your accident .
i wish i could tell you more about these clowns .
it's ...
i don't know , it just takes a certain kind of person ... that would do something like this .
complete and utter distortion of the truth .
welcome to my world , detective .
i'll tell you , bo ...
i don't know what i would do if anyone ever hurt one of my family .
i'm running up against it on this one , bo .
what do you think?
i think you're dealing with a random accident and a suicide .
that's what i think .
well , as it turns out ...
rosner's accident might not be that random .
the investigators are still looking into it .
and now ...
i've got this gun .
excuse me one second .
excuse me , bo .
paul sends his apologies .
that's okay .
how soon until i'm up? : 00 tomorrow morning .
10 : 00 tomorrow?
all right .
thanks , sweetie .
if that's it , i'm gonna head home .
hey , i'm done here .
okay .
oh , bo , there is one thing , and i hate to ask .
would you sign a picture for my kids?
of course .
if it's not too much trouble .
let me just grab a pen .
here .

wife never got a look at the guy , huh?
nah , she didn't .
so , what's the plan?
i know you got something up your sleeve .
the idea of going in there , wendell ... was to protect ourselves .
if we were worried laramie was coming after us before , we have guaranteed it now .
why don't we just call the cops?
and tell them ... we broke into his house ... you attacked his wife ... and that we would like some protection?
you're a moron , wendell .
you're an absolute moron !
what did you expect me to do?
the bitch was all over me .
go home !
check your monitor .
see if laramie's found the cameras .
i gotta think this through .

hey , detective .
good m ...
how did you know it was me?
'cause , uh , i can see your car .
l i'll let you in .
hey .
you caught me .
i was in the shower .
how did my guys do last night?
were they okay?
they were great .
i got a great night of sleep thanks to them .
glad to hear it .
i got something i'd like you to take a look at .
it'll only take a minute .
is everything all right?
great .
what is this?
impound found some video equipment ... in the back of leonard's car .
seems he was wearing a miniature camera when he came to the set .
why are we watching this?
oh , just be patient .
best part is the end .
okay , now ... watch this very closely .
there .
it's a jacket .
and there was something about that jacket ... that was bothering me .
and then it hit me .
the boys at the crime lab prepared this for me .
now , you'll notice that in the first shot ... the lapels are facing away from us .
in the second shot ... the lapels are facing towards us .
and?
i was wondering how the jacket removed itself from its hook ... and turned itself around .
you see , the button cam is all one shot ... it's unedited , uninterrupted .
and leonard left his car and came back only once .
you know what i think?
i think someone on that set ... planted the gun .
excuse me .
burton .
i'm on my way .
you don't want your disc?
keep it .
we got the original .
ma'am , my name is detective burton .
i'm from the los angeles police department ... and i'm here to talk to you about the night of april 18 .
they lied to you , detective .
they caused the accident that night .
then why the hell didn't you come forward with this information before?
this is detective burton .
i need two units to pick up rex harper on suspicion of rape .
berth 40 , slip seven at the marina .
the suspect is a white male , about six feet tall .
