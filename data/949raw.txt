it was just a little test , and i'm glad that i did it , because now i know ... you love me f orever , truly ... and deeply .
lf the simple f act that i didn't want your bloated , dead body ...
lying out on the floor is love , then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this very moment .
oh , no .
i heard genuine care in your voice .
can't be denied , can it , ted?
i think you're right , and if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going ,
i think you'll go a long way to resolving this misunderstanding .
you'd be surprised what happens if people just listen ... without succumbing to all that pain and anger .
you heard shit , monkey boy .
easy f or you to say after you fuck another man's wif e .
you should at least have the guts to stand behind ... your convictions .
she's lying , sigfried .

why are you doing this to me?

happy new year .
let me speak to betty .
uh , party's over .
she probably went home .
she lives there !
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i know her .
well , then get her on the phone .
tell her it's an emergency .
who who should i say is calling?
you tell her it's teddy from work on the phone .
i got some major fucking emergency .
hi , ted .
i'm margaret .
you sound down .
has this not been the happiest of new years?
no , margaret .
this hasn't been my happiest new year .
this one's starting off pretty fucking badly .
aw , how come?
well , betty ...
leaves me here all by myself , and first thing right off the bat ,
i'm fucked by a coven of witches .
you were fucked by an oven full of witches?
a coven of witches !
not an oven !
well , one witch in particular .
was she an old hag with a mole on her f ace with hair growing out of it?
no , no , she was very beautiful .
ted?
what's the problem?
well , admittedly , that was the best part of the evening .
it was pretty bloody good actually .
but it's still a pretty unnerving way to start off the night .
sounds like a pretty great way to start off the night to me .
why don't we just skip over the witches?
skipping the witches .
right .
later , in another room , some crazy fucking maniac sticks a gun in my f ace ... and f orces me to play out some psychosexual drama with his wif e .
he made you have psycho sex with his wif e?
no , he didn't make me fuck his wif e .
he thought i fucked his wif e .
he held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun !
what kind of gun was it?
i don't know .
i'm not a gun guy .
it was big .
was it like dirty harry's gun?
yeah , sort of like that , yeah .
did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel?
what diff erence does it make?
well , f or one thing , it's a diff erence between a . 44 magnum and a magnum . 357 .
who the fuck cares whether it was a . 44 or a . 392?
it was a big fucking gun !
it was loaded !
and it was pointed right at my fucking head !
you wanna skip this part too?
i want you to get betty on the phone right fucking now .
hold on .
anybody live here named
what's her name again?
betty .
betty !
whatcha screaming about?
you're betty?
yeah , i'm betty .
it's my fucking place .
who the fuck are you?
i'm margaret .
and this is ted .
you guys , wanna go to breakf ast?
no .
let's go to denny's .
later .
okay , ted , what's the problem?
hello , betty .
what's the problem?
i haven't got a problem .
i've got fucking problems .
plural .
wanna hear?
sure .
well , most recently , there's room 309 .
there's this scary mexican gangster dude pokin 'his finger in my chest .
there's his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me .
there's a putrid , rotting corpse of a dead whore stuff ed in the springs of the bed .
there's rooms blazing afire .
there's a big f at needle from god knows where , stuck in my leg , inf ecting me with god knows what .
and finally , there's me , walkin 'out the door right fuckin 'now .
buenas noches .
ls that the penthouse?
yes , it is .
it's the chester rush party .
they want something .
well , tough titty .
they're just gonna have to whistle , because i'm off .
now , ted , wait a minute .
i know you're freaked .
i know you're stressed .
you had a real bad night .
oh , yes , betty .
i've had a real bad night .
the only thing i ask is that you take care of chester rush , and then you can leave .
i don't f eel like it !
ted , he's a very important guest of the hotel .
ln f act , he's the most important guest of the hotel .
the mon signor used to be a haven f or movie stars .
through the thirties , forties and first half of the fifties , more movie stars , if you break it down on a night by night basis , stayed at the mon signor than any other hotel in hollywood .
now , we had some hard times in the eighties , even though we were the official hotel of cannon pictures , but we're comin 'back strong in the nineties .
and a movie star clientele is important to that comeback .
now , you look here  he probably just wants some champagne .
you can do that , can't you?
ted .
just take care of him .
the entire staff of the mon signor is begging you .
okay .
but you get your ass down here pronto !
you're a good man , ted .
thanks .
hello , mr. rush .
sorry f or the delay .
how can i help you?
get your skanky asses the fuck outta here !

it's ted .

all right , that wasn't what i was saying .
but would you care f or some champagne?
um , i'm on duty , sir .

chill out , dude .
pay no attention to norman here .
he's just that's from quadrophenia .

now me , personally , when i think of bellboy ,
i think of the bellboy with jerry lewis .
did you ever see that film , ted?
um ... no , sir .
oh , you should .
it's one of jerry's better movies .
he doesn't say a word through the entire film .
it's a completely silent perf ormance .
now how many actors can pull that off?
i gotta tell you , that guy , he's gotta go to france to get respect .
that says it all about america right there .
just that one little sentence says it all about america right there .
the minute jerry lewis dies , every newspaper in this fuckin 'country ... is gonna be writin 'articles callin 'the man a genius .
it's not right .
it's not right and it's not fuckin 'f air !
but why should that surprise anybody?
when the hell has america ever been f air?
we might be right every once in awhile , but we're very rarely f air .
oh .
um ... where shall i put this , sir?

uh , well , um not particularly .
good there !
okay , then gotta stop playin '" beat the clock .

um , sir?
uh huh .
a word in your ear , sir .
sure , sure , sure , sure , sure .
excusez moi .
i treat that bitch like a queen , man .
chester .

i'm fuckin 'working .
as long as you don't break up the furniture ,
i don't give a fuck what you do .
took all your money .
gonna take your kids and house .
as f ar as i'm concerned , go ahead , trash the place !
oh , but , look , let me explain what we're talkin 'about .
sir , sir , you don't have to explain anything to me .
whatever constitutes a good time , as f ar as you guys are concerned , that's your business .
well , no , it's your business too , ted , because we want you to take part .
take part in what , sir?
chester , your way of breakin 'the news to him gently is scarin 'the fuck outta him .
think so?
just spit it out .
okay , okay , here we go .
okay .
thing is , ted , first off , there's nothing homosexual about what we want you to do .
i mean , i was thinkin 'you might be thinkin '... that we want you to do somethin 'like weird sex thing , you know , like , suck us off , pee on us , shit like that .
nothing , nothing could be further from the truth .
can i just jump in here f or a second?
no .
no .
my kind of way of telling him is kind of going all around the world .
but it's the journey that's worth it .
yeah , well , i see that .
but he's been here f or 15 minutes and you have , you know , talked about everything but
what do you care?
why don't you just shut the fuck up , bitch?
" bitch "?
bitch !
uh , excuse me , aren't you the one who's being paid to suck his cock , cork boy?
whoa !
cork boy , man !
business card !
i see a new business card .
excuse me , if it please the court .
allow me to present our intentions to theodore .
i second the nomination .
i move that nomination be closed !
thank you .
the court is yours , leo .
thank you very much , chester .
ted , you ever seen any of them old alfred hitchcock episodes?
yes , sir .
you ever see the one called the man from rio with peter lorre and steve mcqueen?
uh  ah , if you saw it , you'd remember it .
it's called the man from rio with peter lorre , steve mcqueen .
anyway , peter lorre makes a bet with steve mcqueen ... that steve mcqueen can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row .
now , if steve mcqueen lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a row , he wins peter lorre's new car .
but if he does not light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row ,
peter lorre gets to chop off steve mcqueen's little pinky .
norman and chester here just made that same bet .
norman has bet his pinky ... that he can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row .
lf he does , he wins chester's 1964 chevy chevelle ... red , fuckin ', beautiful car .
lf he doesn't , chop off his fuckin 'pinky .
what do you say?
you guys are drunk .
yes !
of course !
of course we're drunk !
teddy , that's why we're here , but that does not mean ... that we don't know what the fuck we're talking about .
i'm gonna tell you what the fuck i'm talkin 'about .
i'm gonna tell you what the fuck i'm talkin 'about .
i drive a motherfucking honda that my sister sold me .
you hear what i'm saying?
a little white motherfuckin 'honda civic !
you see this shit?
" hollywood's hottest new star  that's me . next to america's hottest old car .
that's the car i own .
are you listenin 'to me?
are you?
goddamn shit !
are you listening to me?
now you take a good long look at that there machine ... that this motherfucker over here's standin 'next to .
that's a 1964 nigger red , ragtop chevy chevelle .
and i love that car more than i love hips , lips or fingertips .
we're sittin 'here celebratin ', gettin 'high ,
drinking champagne  drinking cristal .
when you're drinking champagne , you're drinking champagne .
when you're drinking cristal , you say you're drinking cristal .
whatever that pissity ass thing is , we are drinking it , you know .
and we are watching tv .
what , what?
hey , hey , hey .
when all of a sudden , [ tongue clicks ]
we flip on steve mcqueen , peter lorre being fuckin 'badasses .
badass !
badasses !
and i look over at this funny looking motherfucker over here , and i say , " i'd do that f or the chevelle .
i'm funny .
and that's when chester says
oh , really?
well , you guys wouldn't be doing something this stupid unless you were really fucking drunk .
we already told you we were drunk , ted .
that goes without motherfucking saying .
'cause if we wasn't drunk , we'd probably chicken out .
when you're fucked up , you don't lie .
man , you tell the fuckin 'truth .
you want to know what the fuckin 'truth is?
the fuckin 'truth is , my lucky zippo is gonna win me ...
chester's fucking car .
which brings us to your part in this little wager , ted .
i don't have a part , sir .
that's it .
like my old granddaddy used to always say ,
the less a man makes declarative statements , the less apt he is to look f oolish in retrospect .
that's quite brilliant , sir .
ah , thank you , thank you , thank you .
thing is , there are some inherent obstacles in this undertaking .
aside from the obvious .
first of which is being the f act that i'm not like peter lorre on that tv show .
i'm not some sick fuck travelin 'the countryside collecting fingers .
all right , you know , we're all buddies here .
no one wants norman to lose his finger .
we just want to chop it off .
you know , if f ate doesn't smile on old norman , we'll put that fucker on ice , whisk it right to the hospital , where in all likelihood they'll be able to sew it right back on .
well , hopefully , sir .
yeah , well , they sewed that guy's dick back on .
they can sew norman's pinky back on .
yeah , how hard can it be?
yeah , good point .
so , norman , he's , he's taken care of , you know .
his interests have been looked after .
my interests , on the other hand , have not .
i am as emotionally attached to my car as norman is physically to his finger .
that's a very fuckin 'piece of expensive machinery i'm putting on this wager .
and , you know , if i lose , i lose .
that's fine .
that's no problem .
i have no problem with that .
i'm a big boy .
i knew exactly what the hell i was doing .
but if i win , i wanna win .
all right?
lf norman lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a fuckin 'row , he's gonna have no emotional problems whatsoever about taking my car keys .
but if i win , well , it's not inconceivable that at the last minute ... maybe neither leo or i ... will be able to ... wield the axe .
a hatchet , sir .
wield the hatchet .
which brings us full circle to you , ted .
clear eyed ted .
sober ted .
complete stranger ted .
lmpartial ted .
just met us and couldn't give a fuck about us ted .
we want you to be the dice man .
hell of a night , huh , ted?
i've got to get out of here .
money !
ted , i got a $100 bill here with your name on it , whether you do what we ask or not .
just to sit back down in that chair f or one minute more .
i am not gonna cut off norman's little pinky !
well , maybe you will and maybe you won't .
but that has nothin 'to do with this $100 bill in my hand .
ln f act , you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that goddamn door .
but if you wait 60 seconds bef ore you do it , you're gonna be $100 richer .
ted , you're gonna do whatever you wanna do .
all we're askin 'is that you indulge us f or one minute more .
my friend chester here is willing to pay you f or that minute .
ted , take the money .
now , let me get this straight .
i sit on that stool , listen to what you have to say f or 60 seconds ,
and i get $100?
correct .
and afterwards i can walk out that door , no hard f eelings?
none whatsoever .
you got a deal .
yes !
oh , yes , yes !
yes , yes , yes , !
ted , good answer .
sit right down .
all right .
leo , you be the timekeeper .
norman , give me your watch .
let me know when a minute ends and when it begins .
you got it .
ah .
okay .
gentlemen , start your engines .
begin .
okay , ted , pay attention here .
i'm gonna make two piles here on the bar .
one pile which is yours .
and another pile which could be yours .
and what you have to realize is we're gonna do this thing ... one way or the other .
whether it's you who holds the axe or a mexican maid ... or some bum we yank off the street .
you can buy a whole lot of soup with that pile .
shh !
i'm the closer here .
all right .
i'm a little me um , i've lost count .
how much is on the bar here?
six hundred .
okay .
ted , do you know how long it takes the average american to count to 600?
it's a rhetorical question , ted .
no , sir .
about one minute less than it takes to count to 700 .
now , ted , a person's lif e is filled with a zillion little experiences .
some which are insignificant , have no meaning , and , you know , you f orget them .
others which you remember f or the rest of your natural lif e .
now , since what we're proposing here is so unusual , so outside the norm , that this is a good bet that this is going to be one of those incidents that sticks .
so , since you're gonna be stuck remembering this f or the rest of your lif e , you have to decide what that memory will be .
so , ted , are you going to remember f or the next 40 years , give or take a decade , that you refused $1, 000 f or one second's worth of work?
or that you made $1, 000 f or one second's worth of work?
time !
so , ted , what's it gonna be?
okay .
yes !
always be closing !
whoo !
right here , right now !
bef ore i change my mind !
hear , hear .
go .
let's go .
get this shit over and done with .
ahh !
perf ect , perf ect , perf ect .
this is one of those moments in time ... none of us are ever gonna f orget .
norman , are you ready?
i'm ready .
ted , are you ready?
ready .
okeydokey .
norman ... begin .
aaah !
my finger !
my fuckin 'finger !
chester , my fuckin 'finger , man !
he cut off my fuckin 'finger !
oh !
it hurts !
my fuckin 'finger , chester !
he cut off my fuckin 'finger !
aaah !
