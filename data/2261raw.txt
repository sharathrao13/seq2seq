he was brought in at 09 : 00 and they figured he was responsible for setting off a nuke on u. s. soil .
norad picked up a hotspot in the alaskan mountains just outside of fairbanks .
they contacted the warship sumanza , stationed in the bearing strait .
commander drew stevens dispatches troops to the area to observe phase one terrorist protocol .
expect the worst .
whatever happened was to be considered an act of war against the united states .
that's when they called me .
and in the hours that followed
i learned things that were going to change the way we live forever .
don't move !
there's somebody at the door .
oh , god ...
you look like shit , son .
why don't you have a seat , make yourself comfortable?
want to tell me your name?
i've already told you people .
i'm doctor peter lang .
i need to report to major harrison of charlie squadron delta .
i don't have much time .
you a military man , lang?
sort of .
sort of .
that's funny .
i've been in military most of my adult life and i've never met a single person who was " sort of " in the military .
you're either in or you're out , don't you think?
so a pretty straight forward answer i'm looking for here .
so , i'm gonna ask you again .
are you in the military?
i can't talk to anybody in this building .
i'm not authorized to .
call harrison , and he'll understand the urgency of the situation .
i got a pretty good handle on the situation .
two hours ago , somebody detonated a nuclear device on u. s. soil and you're the prime suspect .
that's either an act of war or that's terrorism but either way you're going to answer any question i ask you .
so , why don't we start this again?
are you a military man , lang?
i need to report to harrison , the joint chiefs or the president .
i'm not authorized to talk to you and i won't .
if you get harrison , you might have a chance to save the world .
save the world .
that sounds like a threat to me .
you keep talking about this harrison ... right?
we've been looking for him since you've mentioned his name .
and guess what?
there is no harrison .
the president and the joint chiefs don't have the foggiest idea who peter lang is nor do they have any interest in talking to terrorists .
i suggest that you put me at the top of your priority list and do it pretty quick cause things are about to get ugly around here .
why don't we try this again?
who do you work for , peter?
that kind of smarts , doesn't it?
most fellows start belleding from the ears , but you took this pretty good .
you don't look so bad .
i have ... top information , and you're treating me like a terrorist .
i'm doing that cause this is a matter of national security .
a lot of people out there got a lot of questions and i've been given authorization to use whatever means necessary to get answers to those questions .
i suggest you start telling me what you know now or we're going to go through this over and over again .
i can't .
i love these things .
400, 000 volts running off two nine volts batteries .
this sort of torture used to be sloppy .
buckets , sponges , big cables .
it just wasn't safe .
nowadays , i can carry 400, 000 volts in my hip pocket .
pretty effective , wouldn't you say?
i can't tell you what you want to hear .
you have to trust me .
it's for your own safety .
you're going to tell me what i want to know .
why don't we keep is simple , all right?
tell me how your day started .
hi , honey .
hi , peter .
a phone call would've been nice .
you know how i feel about phones .
baby , go wait in your room , ok?
bye , peter .
see you , kimie .
there's been an incident in the lab .
is everybody ok?
we don't know .
i need to get in .
i need to find out and i need your help .
peter , i ...
an officer will look after kimie .
it won't be long .
ok .
give me five minutes .
don't worry .
i'll be back before you know it .
i love you .
i love you too .
bye , mom .
ok .
fill me in .
i will in the truck .
well ... at 2 : 13 , fairbanks hq received some sort of garbled transmission .
a breach of bio containment six .
two minutes later , somebody on the inside initiated a full lock down .
power's off .
interlock's sealed .
all communications to the outside world were served from the inside .
look , i ...
i called harrison .
oh , jesus .
it could be any number of things .
chemical , or bio , or nuclear .
whatever it is , we're gonna need help .
there're 14 people down there , and the clock is ticking .
you're right .
we're going to need harrison .
we're going to go in with a small combat team .
technical experts .
harrison's very best .
highest possible clearances , just in case .
ok .
if we have to move in , we move in .
but this team of experts they only the best , right?
right .
come to me .
don't even think about it .
i'm on the clock , honey .
don't you think this is more important than the clock?
you're killing me .
sergeant trainer .
dcs tactical briefing in 10 minutes , trainer .
trainer?
did i catch you at a bad time?
no , sir .
i'm just about ... to clear my weapon .
we have a situation .
get o'brien .
you're going in tonight .
affirmative , sir .
we're going in .
why don't you get whoever is on the phone to call you back?
trish?
daddy?
i'm toast .
you ...
trainer?
i'm hall .
communications .
good to meet you , hall .
good to meet you , sir .
you new on the base?
yes , sir .
first time in alaska?
first .
i like it though .
it's cold .
trying to get used to the daylight .
never seems to get dark .
having trouble sleeping , sir .
i've been here for two summers and i still can't get used to it .
and don't call me " sir " .
yes , sir ...
ok .
what have you heard about this mission?
we're being sent there cause you banged the general's daughter .
jesus christ !
what?
bad news travels fast .
you know kids .
no .
you see she had her 22nd birthday last week .
whatever you say , sir .
hear anything else?
it looks that we're going to be accompanied by major ross and what's her dick?
get my volley?
ross ...
sir?
i wonder why they'd send a major on a mission like this .
can't say , sir .
haven't met the man myself ... but o'brien ... she really drove our regiment into the ground in iraq .
she's a tough mother for a hole , let me tell you .
that's what i heard ...
but why would a half decent looking chick like o'brien ... want to be an officer?
everybody knows any chick that tough has to be a lesbo .
she's get in the army to get the colonel's daughter , probably .
sir ...
ma'am !
when you finished bonding , re join the rest of the army .
full mission breaking in two .
yes , ma'am .
sarge ... you need a larger weapon .
welcome to alaska , hall .
thank you , gentlemen .
'ten hut !
all right , people , at ease .
this mission is black .
no medals , no rewards , no lucrative book deals .
our target destination is vectol bio research laboratories ... outside fairbanks , alaska .
although it is a civilian facility , it is under contract to uncle sam ... and my responsibility .
dr. cole ...
captain o'brien , is our best in bio chem ...
sergeant hall , is our communications specialist ...
trainer , weapons and explosives , lastly ...
major ross , our counter terrorism expert .
dr. cole?
three hours ago , someone at our lab initiated an emergency lock down .
we've had no communication since .
there're 14 researchers trapped down there .
we need to get them out .
only 23 people outside this room know about those labs .
of those 23 only a handful are privy to the work they do .
although this is classified , we'll give you what we can .
dr. cole?
dr. lang ... head of the bio weapons counter measures at vectol .
vectol labs are located in an abandoned copper mine ... 500 feet below the surface .
it's been retrofitted as a high tech bio chemical facility .
access is through a single air lock and elevator .
there are four levels : research , weapons , chemical , living quarters .
below that is an emergency air lock .
once you're in , nothing gets out .
there's been only one other breach of this facility two years ago .
a lab tech accidentally spilled a thimble full of nerve gas .
a thimble full .
he died ninety seconds later .
it took us three months to clean out that isolation lab .
we are dealing with a full isolation lock down .
trainer?
why us?
dr. lang?
vectol labs do a multitude of sins .
chemical , bio , nuclear toxins .
stuff we have down there makes ebola look like the common cold .
it's possible terrorists breached the facility .
we need to find out .
don't we have any other intelligence on this?
latest satellite re con flight shows all is clear .
perimeter secure .
this is avery sensitive situation .
fewer people envolved , the better , that's why i'm sending the best .
i'm a scientist , but i'm also a former army captain .
once inside , all of you answer directly to me .
trainer?
people?
is that clear?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
good .
these are not your standard suits .
they're made from kevlar purine fiber .
think of them as a2nd skin .
your atmosphere gauge is at the wrist .
green is for good air , yellow for questionable ... and if it's red and you've just breathed it , you've died .
this is for your oxygen .
you have about one hour's worth .
what are these syringes for , doctor?
excuse me .
if one of you become contaminated ... remove the hypodermic from the pouch ... and then plunge it directly in the neck ... as deep as ...
don't do that . ... as possible .
avoid severing the carotid artery .
i'll do that .
the needle releases a neuro toxin .
it would save your life and get you to treatment as quickly as possible .
and what if we don't get stuck?
what happens then?
that depends on which toxin you've been infected with ... but within 10 seconds your throat constricts .
you can't breath .
your esophagus becomes brittle and it dissolves .
your organs turn to jelly as your molecular structure is collapsing .
but after that , you should mercifully black out .
i get the picture .
have either one of you tried ... this needle?
yeah .
dr. cole has .
what happened?
gear up .
we move out in ten .
any other questions?
dismissed .
i think she likes me , o'brien .
what are you talking about?
she's a grown up .
i should try that .
colonel !
major .
permission to speak freely , sir .
go ahead .
i'm not comfortable taking my orders from these scientists .
you take your orders from me .
follow cole and lang to the letter .
yes , sir , but babysitting civilians is ...
cole can take care of herself .
it's lang i need you to cover .
he works for me .
his project is classified ... has top priority on the pentagon .
cole doesn't know about it .
she thinks she's in command .
work with her all the way .
if it's viral or chemical , she's in charge .
it it's terrorist , you take command .
your priority is make sure lang gets his research out .
my team has the highest security clearance .
i need to know what's going on down there .
this is a matter of national security .
nobody can know about it .
when it comes to biologicals , even the president is expendable .
yes , sir .
lang is the priority .
if i'm a terrorist , what's my primary target down there?
there's enough plutonium in that mountain to satisfy a small army .
terrorists or not , we're going to find our people okay down there .
just hope my staff are safe .
with this lock down there's a chance the air's been contaminated .
keep your helmets on and breathe easy .
and conserve your air as long as possible .
you got that?
cole ... if we do encounter terrorists , stand down and let my team handle this .
your team?
your team will do what i say .
this is a chemical lab .
nobody does anything without my approval .
you got that , major?
trainer , hold up a sec .
i've got a bad feeling about this .
you're just scared .
that's not what i meant .
chemical weapons , possible terrorists ... small crew , civilian in charge ...
we're going in there and no one is telling us anything about it .
how many times have you and i been down this road before?
you watch my back , i'll watch yours all right .
i hate working with civilians .
you wanted delta .
deal with it .
lang .
what?
the minute you know how to get out of there , you let me know .
i don't need my team staying in this tunnel any longer than they have to .
i'll recommend immediate e vac as soon as i get what i need .
and , major , our relationship stays confidential .
that's what i hear .
peter , check the intercom , see if anyone responds .
no , doc , not a good idea .
if they're terrorists you don't want to give away our position , right?
good point .
let's keep the chatter to a minimum , ok?
jesus , lang !
will you back the fuck up?
holster that weapon .
this isn't right .
what's your concern , cole?
the reading .
there's something in the air but i don't know what it is .
what's with this water?
i have no idea .
i've never seen anything like this .
hey , ross .
what have you got?
looks like a gold tooth .
that's a little more than unusual .
got some slime all over it .
what's the slime like?
is it toxic?
i don't think so .
cole , you should take a look at it .
maybe the sprinkler system broke here .
it's not ho or retardant .
cole ... what do you think?
major !
hall .
got a number 45 here ... emptied the clip .
what the hell they shooting at?
no matter , but stay sharp so it doesn't end up shooting at you .
i found a pacemaker .
it's still beating .
jesus !
this is creepy .
we need to get to work .
hall , trainer and o'brien ... restore communications and power .
it's through these doors .
it's down one level .
keep to the right .
it's at the end of the hall .
after that , sweep level 3 .
it's the living quarters .
wait .
you want us to split up?
ross , what do we do?
you have your orders .
report if you see anyone .
rcb will be level 2 .
containments labs .
we'll meet there .
how many people we looking for?
fourteen .
you heard the lady , let's move out .
i think we should look for the guy with the pacemaker .
just my luck , i'm red shit , baby .
this way .
dr. lang , this isn't a picnic .
let's move .
this is worse than we thought .
you recognize it .
it's got the molecular structure of human dna .
doctors?
what is this stuff?
we're not sure just yet .
major , i wouldn't stand under there if i were you .
where the hell is everybody?
i don't know .
trainer ... ever notice our missions have become a little more hazardous?
what are you talking about?
look around you .
we're in a factory full of biological weapons .
so , what's that got to do with me?
she's jailbait and she's the colonel's daughter .
would you put a pipe in it?
she's not jailbait , captain .
she looks at least 19 or 10 .
that's my man , hall .
she ain't no child .
you're just jealous , o'brien .
come on , o'brien , who you kidding?
wouldn't you take a run at her if you had a chance?
careful , hall , or i'm going to take a run at you .
want to get you guys a room?
hall's not my type , trainer .
he thinks i'm a lesbo .
i'm ok with lesbos .
just kidding .
it's gone .
what?
no , that's impossible .
what's gone?
i can't talk about it with you .
i don't give a damn about your secret weapons .
i'll tell you what you need to know when you need to know it .
are my people in any danger?
not more than the rest of us .
that's not an answer .
give us a moment , major .
one of our experiments has gone missing .
we need to find it .
ross .
copy?
go ahead , captain .
auxiliary power was up in the lab level only .
the generator doesn't work .
hall can't get any more power of it .
good work .
we've completed the sweep of the living quarters .
not a soul , sir .
proceed to communications .
try to raise harrison .
and captain ... watch your back .
anything on your end , sir?
one of the doctor's experiments has gone missing .
what kind of an experiment?
they're both tight lipped .
until i know more , assume we're still dealing with terrorists .
exercise extreme caution and report back every 10 minutes .
understood .
it's not just a walk in the park .
not today .
if i can squeeze any more out of them i'll contact you .
roger that .
reporting back in 10 .
in 10 minutes .
missing experiment .
doesn't sound too good .
not in this place , it ain't .
stay sharp .
we got a job to do .
what the hell happened here?
you fix this up , hall?
raise topside?
i could raise mars if i had to , but ... it's probably easier to ... jerry rig the up line and get cell communications working .
this is creepy .
slime covering everything .
like something out of the blob .
holy shit , hall , that's it .
what?
the doctor's experiments is probably just like the blob .
it's loose and it's sliming up everything in its path ... devouring everything it can .
you know what?
we're dessert .
you're not funny .
what are you talking about?
you're not funny , man .
you see that?
yeah , right .
let's focus .
i'm serious .
i saw some guy .
i swear !
hall .
jesus !
you saw someone?
i think .
hall , raise topside .
let's go .
are you serious?
i'm serious .
get in there .
get communications up .
i'll check the door .
all right .
let's hope the containment lab remains secure .
is it possible somebody moved it?
it's possible , but unlikely .
it takes a team of 8 to move it .
if it had been moved , we would have known .
what about the plutonium?
it is all accounted for , major ... but right now it's the least of our worries .
the air is clean .
cole , check the computer data .
see if somebody's moved it .
i'll check bio containment 6 .
major ross , you watch her back .
major ross , external com is up and operating , sir .
good work , trainer .
o'brien , continue to sweep , report if you find anyone .
roger .
i'll continue .
command , alpha team reporting .
this is harrison .
report .
auxiliary power and communications restored , sir .
we have control of the main lab .
still no sign of the staffers .
we do however have a missing experiment .
we're going to look for it ... ... and any sign of terrorists .
keep me posted .
you did this to me .
stay here .
watch my back .
jesus christ !
is that you , sara?
what the hell happened?
it got out .
we didn't stand a chance .
nobody's going to be able to stop it .
it's under my skin , peter .
it's under my goddamn skin !
sara , no !
look what you've done to me .
radiation is the only way to kill it .
what happened?
i need to kill us all .
for christ's sakes , don't do that !
it's inside me .
i can feel it .
inside me .
i can feel it .
lf you're gonna kill us all , stop !
no !
please , don't make me do this .
just stop .
sara , i'm so sorry .
cole , no !
cole , you just executed a civilian .
she was no longer human .
then what was she?
lang , why didn't you try to help her?
she was infected .
infected with what?
there are infectious agents here .
not good enough , doctor .
the radiation would've gone critical .
i did what i had to do .
i want answers .
i need to know now !
what are we up against?
there are no terrorists , are there?
we can't be certain .
i reckon that we leave now .
that's the first sensible thing either of you have said all day .
we're not leaving until we figure out the fate of our staff .
you just saw what happened to our staff .
trainer , give me a situation report .
nothing down here but slime , sir .
other than that , all seems clear .
return to the lab .
we're getting out of here .
if you meet anyone , assume that they're hostile .
sergeant , keep your suits on at all times .
hostile , sir?
we just met one of the staffers .
it wasn't pretty .
she was infected with something .
it's been secured .
secured , sir?
permanently .
understood .
meet back at the lab .
report anything suspicious .
copy that .
this whole place is suspicious .
command , this is alpha team .
one second .
harrison .
report .
the situation isn't good .
we can confirm contamination .
cole , you there?
yes , sir .
situation?
the facility has been breached and the pb3 is missing .
colonel ...
i suggest that we brief ross on the intel that we have on pb3 .
our chances of surviving through this mission will be greater .
fill him in my full authorization .
yes , sir .
we first heard about it after chernobyl .
soviets discovered an alien microbe on a meteorite that crashed in siberia in the 10's .
they called it pb3 to honor the third session of the politburo ... or something like that .
once the microbe was separated it reproduced at an alarming rate .
their scientists attempted to clone it .
no dice .
in the end , it took a 10 megaton nuke and 10, 000 lives to put that genie back in the bottle .
after the wall collapsed , uncle sam took all responsibility and brought it to us .
government hired vectol to study the military potential and applications of pb3 to see how to counter it .
as a liquid , it had this ... intelligence .
it could think , learn .
imagine , a single alien life from the size of a drop of water that we could train to kill whatever we wanted it to .
a drop of water that could survive in any landscape from a nuclear environment to the blood stream of a human body .
what's the difference between the liquid and pb3?
the liquid is what pb3 produces .
the pb3 is actually an alien .
we cloned the microbe's dna .
are you telling me there's an alien loose down here?
jesus !
alien?
is that so hard to believe?
i'm getting pretty tired of your bullshit , lang .
you'd better start feeding me something easier to swallow .
sir?
go ahead , captain .
we're still coming up blank on harrison but we've been able to confirm that ross , o'brien , trainer and hall do in fact exist as members of the charlie squadron delta .
they're stationed in fairbanks .
their c. o. , major tindal confirms they were requested for a black op at 04 : 00 .
he won't give up any details of the mission .
he wasn't cleared for it .
thank you , captain .
it's an alias .
what are you muttering about?
harrison would never implicate himself if anything were to go wrong .
we're down to working on secrets that our government can never admit .
things that could topple our nation's credibility .
what if north korea knew the kind of warfare we were trying to perfect?
we're giving them a hard time with the nuclear program when all the while we're cloning aliens for military application .
are you telling me that you're an independent contractor working with the military on cloning aliens?
you're not a believer .
you don't think in this vast universe another life form exists?
one that's more versatile , smart , dangerous we know humans to be?
every year , hundreds of meteorites slam into our planet .
we found a drop of water on one .
you have any idea how many we never find?
how many other drops of water are out there?
o'brien , you see that?
see what?
something tells me we're not alone .
what did you see?
what do you thing it was?
looks like a guy about 10 feet ahead .
u. s. army .
show yourself .
stand up and put your hands behind your head .
are you here to help?
hands behind your head , now !
i'm a doctor .
on your knees .
i work here .
get you hands on your head now !
get down !
gun !
hall's down !
check him out !
hall !
hall !
get up , hall !
what's going on back there , o'brien?
he's got a pulse .
he's alive .
the suit is bullet proof all right .
the guy though , where did he go?
freeze !
trainer , did you see that?
o'brien , look out !
oh my god !
something's on my hand !
it's burning !
what are you doing?
got to get this off !
it's burning !
my hand is burning !
burning !
holy shit , o'brien !
my arm is burning !
holy shit , o'brien !
hang on .
we got good air .
i'm taking off your helmet .
i'm going to stick you .
hang in there .
hall , get your ass over here now .
hurry up .
what happened to her?
come on , we got to get her out of here right now .
move !
move !
we've got a problem .
the captain's been infected .
she needs help , now .
cole , open the door .
i won't do that .
help !
let me in !
cole , you open the door right now and assist my team .
major , if we let o'brien in here she could kill us all .
listen to me !
you open the goddamn door right now !
trainer , tell me what color her eyes are .
what?
her eyes .
what color are they?
they're black .
black .
it's too late .
ross .
we're losing her .
you open the door , now !
give me a sec here , trainer .
i got a situation .
we don't have a fucking second .
she's dying !
suit up .
we're taking her topside .
we can't do that .
she has been contaminated .
ross , we're losing her .
open the door !
open it now !
o'brien , this is ross .
you hang in there , all right?
we can't take her out of the mountain .
she'll contaminate every living organism she comes in contact with .
civilization as we know it , will no longer exist .
we don't have a cure for this thing .
she can't be saved .
get trainer and hall as far away from her as quick as you can .
out there they stand a chance of becoming exposed themselves .
cole ... get out here and fix her up .
she's my partner , do you hear me?
open the door .
i said open the goddamn door .
ross , she's been convulsing ever since she got infected .
what did you do , bastard?
you shot her , you bastard .
trainer , o'brien was already dead .
what?
what?
what she was infected with has no known cure .
if we stand out here , we'll have better chance of becoming infected .
no !
i gave her the shoot !
i gave her the shoot !
she's dead , man .
we got to get out of here .
that's an order .
you killed her !
she covered you ass so many times !
she never would have survived .
i gave her the shot .
i did what i was told ... and you should fix her up .
it should have worked !
but it's a different strain and we have no cure .
now if we get infected , we die exactly like the same way .
this liquid that attacked o'brien ...
is this our alien?
alien?
like as in the movie?
the liquid is a bi product of the alien .
it's doing exactly what we designed it to do .
you designed a fucking alien?
no , we cloned an alien .
from a drop of water that was discovered on a meteorite .
weapons specifically designed to help preserve the human race .
but before we could develop the counter inoculation we had to first create de pb3 .
in theory we thought that if we could clone it , we could kill it .
and then , we would be ready in case it ever attacked .
you cloned a frigging alien and the government thought that was ok?
it's also extremely intelligent .
i'm going to sit down for this .
each time the pb3 encounters a new organism the alien's molecular structure co ordinates an attack .
it essentially consume us using our mass and our intelligence to grow ... mutating , changing .
it can almost go into any form liquid or human .
it has the ability to take the human host and attain its goal .
and what the hell goal is that?
it would like to control the planet .
and it was ok to clone something that could control the planet .
that's real smart .
real smart .
and you alien escaped , start infecting your crew but somebody caught on and locked the place down .
that seems to be what happened .
but the pb3 is reacting unlike anything we have ever seen before .
what it did to o'brien and hall , that's new .
it's trying to breach our suits .
it's learned to hunt .
if this thing gets out , it will be impossible to stop .
we can't let that happen .
what do we do to control it?
we have been developing a ...
cole !
i need to show you something .
excuse us .
it's the frigging blob .
they're in love with this thing .
we got to fucking kill it .
harrison convinced me to take it to the next step .
he didn't want me working with anyone .
classified all my research .
i couldn't even tell you about it .
what are you talking about?
i developed a new strain .
you did what?
the microbe was just the embryo .
there's 3 chromosomes called x , y , and z and 3 sexes that cross fertilize and mutate into a new organism .
the russians couldn't do it , you couldn't do it , but i did .
oh my god !
my god , peter .
why?
you honestly think you could spend the rest of your life in this hole?
i've been here for 5 years .
i want out .
i want out .
to do what?
to publish ... to receive the nobel .
but for what?
the pb3 .
but that's impossible .
you know it's impossible .
for the security issues and because there's nothing to publish .
we still don't know how it works .
we can find out how it works .
prove that life exists outside our world .
you have screwed us all .
suit up .
we're leaving .
i never signed up to fight no martians .
command , this is alpha team .
command , alpha team reporting .
this is harrison .
report .
situation .
lang and cole have identified an alien species loose down here .
lang?
yes , colonel .
are you ready to come out?
yes , there's nothing more i can do here .
cole , how serious is it?
it's beyond our control , sir .
cole , you call it .
i recommend immediate deployment .
christ .
major ross?
sir?
evac your people within 10 minutes .
i'm going to nuke the mountain .
affirmative , sir .
get your people out of there .
thank you , sir .
how far are we going to get in 10 minutes?
10 minutes is plenty of time .
don't you worry .
but you're gonna nuke the mountain .
you can't get away from a nuclear blast in 10 minutes .
this facility is built to contain the blast .
as long as we make it to an air lock we'll be safe .
you see that?
straight ahead .
i see it .
what do you think , trainer?
i think that's the same stuff that attacked o'brien .
we back track and we go around .
we don't have time .
don't worry .
this is what we do .
trainer , hall ...
on my command .
let's see how this thing responds under fire .
this one's for o'brien .
fire in the hall !
go !
go !
that's great !
we just blew a water cooler .
we got to get out of here .
nice shot , bro .
frigging water cooler .
this is just wrong .
time is ticking , we got to go .
stay sharp , hall .
can't believe we just did that .
goddamn it .
a trained delta force shooting at a water cooler .
what's next?
a killer vending machine?
can't believe we nailed an alien .
stay focused .
get out of here .
we're almost there .
we got to make it to the elevator .
trainer , the door .
hall , cover .
copy that .
copy that , sir .
my god , what's with spiders?
spiders?
cole , watch your ...
i hate spiders !
we have to have control of the elevator .
it's the only way out !
activate fire on the elevator !
clear the elevator !
ross , behind you !
where are they all coming from?
lang , watch out !
lang , are you ok?
there's too many of them !
ross , they're on your feet !
i got them .
trainer , 12 o'clock .
hall , watch out !
just keep firing , hall .
i don't know what to do .
my god !
it's a nightmare , man .
it's a nightmare !
i don't know what to do .
don't !
fire in the hole !
everyone , back up .
is anyone hit?
hall , what were you thinking?
i'm going to get out of here .
you just sealed our only exit .
there's got to be stairs .
there's no stairs .
he's going to save us , right?
i wouldn't count on it .
fall back , everyone !
fall back !
hall , have you lost your mind?
there's got to be another way out .
i sure hope so .
first we've got to get to the lab and stop the nuke .
shit , i forgot about the nuke !
we're screwed .
command , this is alpha team .
ross , you'd better be in that elevator .
elevator is negative for evac , sir .
hostiles in control .
harrison , stop the nuke .
the count is at 00 : 03 : 10 .
any chance you can make the auxiliary air lock?
negative , sir .
there's not enough time .
you'll have to re set it manually .
we can handle the manual detonation on this end .
susan , you know what this means .
yes , sir .
it's your call .
don't worry .
i'll handle it .
all right , i'll stop the count .
come on !
ok .
we're here .
the bomb fuse is 5 levels below .
the auxiliary air lock is about 300 yards down the passage way .
peter !
stand back .
nobody touch him .
peter !
peter !
what the fuck is that?
jesus christ !
where's the fuck it go?
peter !
oh , god !
he's dead .
put your helmets on .
we have to get out of here .
cole , you have anything that can fight this thing?
yeah , i think i do .
ross , we got to go .
this weapon has been designed for close range combat .
fresh off the assembly line .
they've never been tested on either .
wait a minute .
we're going to be the first ones to use them?
that's right .
these are warheads , gentlemen , and they contain a gas design to kill a specific breed of alien .
you'll be fighting a new strain but , hopefully , it should work .
we have to get these toxins out of the warheads and into these canisters to load the guns .
piece of cake .
the toxin was designed to infect those who have not been inoculated .
i hope you don't mind needles .
shouldn't i get another warhead?
back over by the sink .
there's a case on top , be careful .
doc , what do you make of this?
oh , god !
oh , god !
what?
everyone out !
out !
get out , ross !
jesus !
cole , what's going on?
we got to get out now !
come on , let's go .
let's move !
shit , shit , shit .
what happened to him , cole?
the toxin .
he's dead .
cole , answer me .
oh , god ...
our helmets .
the air quality is not good .
we have to make it to a secure air lock .
let's get out of here .
lang is dead .
we just lost hall .
have you reset bomb?
not yet .
we're on our way .
cole , we might be soon facing an invasion .
we need to be prepared .
lang followed orders you wouldn't .
you shouldn't let moral judgement interfere with your work .
harrison , we'll set that nuke , but that pb3 experiment ends here .
that ends now .
this is on your head .
cole .
it's your decision , cole .
are we facing a goddamn invasion?
it this thing gets out , we're facing extinction .
how long can we stay exposed to this air?
long enough to make it to the next air lock it we're lucky .
cole !
more frigging spiders .
what the frig is that?
go !
ross , let's go !
what the hell is that thing?
run !
cole?
what is that?
hurry up !
not enough air in here .
just get to the air lock .
i'm slowing it down , but i'm not stopping it .
oh , no !
the keypad's not working !
let me at it .
cole , cover trainer .
i got it .
trainer?
i'm working on it .
trainer .
c4 .
it'll be close .
come on , come on .
i got it .
it's open .
go .
go , go .
my god .
you guys ok?
yeah , you?
i'm cool .
it's not every day you almost get killed by an alien .
let's go .
be careful out there .
any more surprises waiting for us down here , cole?
i sure hope not .
but we should expect the worse .
was that your missing experiment back there?
i don't know what that was .
maybe it's some sort of mutation .
you're learning quick , major .
let's just get this over with .
sounds good to me .
everybody watch their backs .
let's do this .
the bomb is in here .
the air lock is at the other end of the tunnel .
we part company here .
i'll set the bomb and meet you guys outside .
that's too risky .
we stay together .
ross and i are going to cover the door .
you're going to go in and set the timer then we all go to the air lock .
ok .
great .
they're guarding the bomb .
they know we're trying to kill them .
how do you want to handle this?
very slowly towards the detonator and hope for the best .
this isn't going to be easy .
there's so many of them .
easy ...
they appear to be dormant .
easy ...
no sudden movements .
we should be ok .
let's get this done and get out .
watch your step .
cover my back , ross .
i've got your back .
so far , so good .
oh , my god !
trainer?
look out !
cole , look out !
trainer , double time .
trainer , come on !
ross , behind you !
look out !
trainer , come on !
trainer , hurry up !
faster !
let's get out of here .
go , go !
come on !
trainer !
ross !
the timer is toast .
i can't get it to work .
what?
it doesn't work .
the detonator?
the detonator will work ... but i got to arm it manually .
no .
it's my responsibility .
i'll do it .
i'll give you enough time to get out .
you're the only who knows how to fight this thing if it gets out .
sir?
get her to the exit .
no , major .
that's an order .
yes , sir .
you'll die .
i've got no one waiting for me topside besides how often does a guy get a chance to save the world?
i'm so sorry .
me too .
trainer .
sir?
get this to harrison .
my final order and i'd like to make good on it .
yes , sir .
ross ... you're a brave man .
go on , get out of here .
yes , sir .
let's go !
cole , look out !
go !
where the hell are they?
oh shit !
easy ...
trainer , i'm down .
you go .
i'll set the bomb .
no .
this is my responsibility .
not an option , ok?
trainer ...
i'm not going to argue with you .
it's what i do .
that's my job .
go on .
get out of here .
wait .
wait a minute .
ross ... what do you want to do with this?
that ends here .
i knew you're going to say that .
get the hell off him .
die , you alien scum !
die !
oh , fuck ...
i love you , mommy .
i love you , baby .
are you ok?
you all right?
the others?
they didn't make it .
did you secure sample?
you know i couldn't do that .
your helmet?
it's gone .
you expect me to believe that?
you're telling me a story that you couldn't possibly have witnessed .
you were left behind , you were left for dead .
it was the right thing to do .
i would have infected the team .
it was dangerous to keep me around .
but i followed them out , i witnessed everything .
how did you get out , if cole was the last one in that air lock?
did you witnesses that explosion?
the nuke would've killed everything .
but you survived .
yes , i did .
how?
isn't it obvious?
i had to survive to keep my species alive .
do you believe in me now?
captain ... we need to get our guest to the white house .
