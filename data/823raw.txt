forthose ofyou who thinkyoucamehere today ... to hear us tell you like these negro leaders do ... thatyour times will just get better ... that weshall overcomesomeday ...
i say toyou , you came to the wrong place .
becauseyour times will never get better unless you make them better .
those ofyou who thinkyou came here to hear us tell you ... to turn the other cheek to the brutality ofthe white man ... and this system ofinjustice that's in place right here in america ... you thinkyou're gonna come here and hear us tell you ... to go out there and beg for a place at their lunch counter ... again , i sayyou came to the wrong place .
we don't teach you to turn the other cheek in the south .
and we don't teach you to turn the other cheek in the north .
the honorable elijah muhammad teaches you to obey the law ... to carryyourselves in a respectable way ... in a proud afro american way .
but at the same time , we teach you ... that anyone puts their hand on you ... brother , you doyour best to see they don't put their hand on anybody else ... again .

angelo , tell me  malcolm xwas in town , then he left .
was that so he wouldn't embarrass you?
yeah , howard?

goodevening , ladiesandgentlemen .
brought toyou by the city service oil company ... and its dealers in 37 states and canada ... known to millions ofmotorists for big gallon gasoline ... and by new wildroot , totally new wildroot in a new tube ... with a great formula that grooms hair to look neat and natural , never greasy .
another boxing milestone is at hand .

introducing , on my right
and now the time has come .
both challenger and champion are in the ring .
the heavyweight championship ofthe world is on the line .
ifit goes past the first round , there will be surprises already .
sonny liston wrapped in that terry cloth towel ofhis ... wrapped around his head swami fashion ...
iooking as malevolent and baleful as ever .
but this man is a professional prizefighter .
make no mistake about it .
i want a clean fight .
when i say break , stop punching and step back .
doyou have any questions , champ?
any questions , challenger?
we're fine .
touch gloves , gentlemen .
good luck .
good evening , sports fans across the nation .
liston in the white trunks with the black stripes .
clay , an inch and a halftaller , in the white trunks with the red stripes
and cassius clay is sidestepping .
there it is , champ .
stay on your toes now .
and we can see that the champion is the aggressor .
there's a shot under the heart .
cassius clay slips away .
and now clay pounds a left .
another left .
a straightjab .
it seems to have stunned him .
and that's the bell .
and they're fighting after the bell .
and they're still fighting .
this round is over .
break it up , ref .
there is no love lost between the two contenders at this time .
cassius goes back to his corner .
it's been an amazing round .
you can beat this guy .
i'm still here .
and sonny liston is not taking the stool .
he's anxious to get back into the challenger's face .
take it to the body .
kill the body , the head will follow .
this is a totally different fight than liston expected ... and anyone in this arena will tell you .
there's a long , looping left hand .
clay's eyes are wide open now .
come on , cass !
move !
step back .
come on , cassius !
come on , chi chi !
i'm not prognosticating anything ... but merely his survival to thisjuncture
cass , hit him !
break .
let him go .
sonny liston is hurt .
he's bleeding from his eye .
he's defying the experts early .
we have to take a look at this man and say he is not in awe ofthe champion .
he ain't nothin 'to me .
and he know it .
this is it now .
let me have that, john .
and now they're ready .

clay lands a left , but liston ducked under it ... and took it high on the forehead .
it's clay coming on .
and liston backs away .
and all the predictions are going down the drain ... as liston is listless .
and there's the bell .
we're coming up to round seven .

clay is the name ofthe people that owned my ancestors ... and i no longerwanna be called by that slave name .
i am cassius x.
minister malcolm .
what about the divisions in the nation oflslam?
this is the champ's time .
i'm here as a friend to support his victory ... so i have nothing you want .
i'm definitely gonna be the people's champion ... but i just ain't gonna be the champ the wayyou want me to be the champ .
i'm gonna be the champ the way i wanna be .
... fornohomeis immune to termites ... nomatterhow well itisbuiltormaintained .
hey , brother .
i was leaving .
i sawyour light on .
whatyou doing up at this hour , champ?
oh , man , i'm watching this program on termites .
and them little itsy bitsy things is eatin 'these people's whole house down .
oh , man , look .
i've been invited to speak at lbadan university in nigeria .
you wanna go with me?
hey , look , man .
you can have six million termites in your house and don't even know it ... till you going to get something to eat and you bust through the floor .
what'd you say?
where?
africa .
you been?
africa .
all right , come on .
let's go .
what is it?
you ever thought you'd lose it?
i mean , really lose it?
when i was little , i tore out this picture of emmett till .
they put the barbed wire around his neck ... and strapped him to that 75 pound cotton gin fan .
and they cut out one ofhis eyes 'cause he looked at some white lady .
man .
i couldn't take my eyes to it , couldn't throw it away .
when i heard about those ... four little girls who got bombed in that birmingham church ...
the prohibitions ofthe honorable elijah muhammad prevented me ... from speaking my thoughts in action .
because birmingham was part ofthe civil rights struggle .
you know , begging for our place at the white man's table .
but dead children are dead children .
so the anger i felt i had to contain .
i locked it up so tight ... my muscles seized .
i lost control over the right side ofmy body .
my leg gave out .
right arm gave out .
i'm having a stroke , " i thought .
but i had to hold it in 'cause all i wanted
brother , all i wanted to do was find something and break it .
break a part break any part ofthis system ... becauseyou are so provoked in your heart ... and your spirit as a human being ... at dead children .
and i could do ... nothing .
everyone knows i can't do nothing ... anymore .
so elijah muhammad has suspended me as a minister in the nation oflslam .
man ... you can fix that .
i don't know .
i'll trywhen we get back .
you get some rest , champ .
all right , brother .
sit .
you know , only after long service and high merit ... in the spiritual and physical rebirth ofafro american people ... is one granted an original name .
butyou are special .
a world champion .
so there is a gift i wish to giveyou .
from this day forward ... you will be known as muhammad ali .
what?
that's right .
you what?
well , what's wrong with our name?
my name?
we we madeyou .
ain't nobody made me .
no bow tie wearin ', arab talkin 'nigger gonna change that .

here come the left .
here come the right .
but the mummy can't hit what the mummy can't see ...
'cause i'm too fast for him .
i'm too fast .
i'm too fast .
i'm too fast .
i move too good for him .
i'll hit george foreman so many times , he'll think he's surrounded .
he gonna say , " call the police !
it's five of'em in here !
i'm bad , man .
i'm bad !
muhammad , i'm sorry .
i have to ask .
areyou really fast enough anymore ... to beat george foreman?
ifhe gets you against the ropes , he can knockyou out with either hand .
many people believeyou're not the man you used to be ten years ago .
see , now , howard ...
i didn't even want to talk about this , man .
especially not out here in front ofall these people .
but i talked toyourwife ... and she said you not the man you used to be twoyears ago !
champ .
champ , george had an accident .
he he had what?
what areyou talking about?
he got cut right above his right eye .
his sparring partner's elbow split it open .
can he fight?
not for six weeks .
this is not a humorous situation , my champ .
this postponement could be long , especially ifgeorge leaves .
you trying to pull something here , don?
ifgeorge leaves , he ain't comin 'back .
george don't like it here .
how rightyou are , my suspicious and short ltalian brother .
look here , man , my fiduciary responsibility ... to this first all black promotion ... is analogous to a garden in the african sun it must grow , it must bloom .
cannot flower in the gloom and shade ofpostponement to the astrodome ... or any dome out ofzaire where it be deprivileged oflight and bled ofwater .
'cause what gonna be bleedin 'out of there is money a hemorrhage ofcash .
i'm talkin 'about blood on the floor .
double hotel costs , airplane , travel costs , food and beverage .
so what doyou want us to do?
muhammad ali .
the people's champion .
my black brother .
i need you .
i need your strength .
i need you to find a way to get george to stay .
be moses in reverse .
do not let my people go .
keep them the fuck right here in egypt .
ifyou'll pardon my swahili .
lingala .
saywhat?
they speak lingala .
ali wants his title , and he wants it in zaire .
okay , all right , okay .
let's take it back .
george go , george go .
hell , i can getyoujoe frazier .
ali frazier 3 .
that's the fight everybodywant to see .
we don't want frazier , we want george .
hell , i don't control george foreman .
there's been an accidental injury to george foreman in training .
the truth is ...
george knocked hisselfout .
that's right .
he did three rounds , realized he was gonna lose to muhammad ali ... and knocked hisselfout .
i predict that when the fight is set , he might not show .
oh , you bad .
that's right , i'm a bad man .
ain't no doubt about that .
yeah , butyou tell george the same thing .
i heard you .
i been watching you .
i know he's your man , i knowyou got him picked , but the man is in trouble .
the whole world was gonna know , but now he ain't gonna show .
in order to ensure that george is ready , we are thinking ofpostponing ... from september 24 to october 30 .
what about the concert?
the concert will go on as planned .
those dates are september 20 , 21
i want all the helicopters guarded , all the private planes , private boats .
i'm serious .

all you zaireans , y'all be on guard too .
any strange boats creeping away , they might be taking him out .
