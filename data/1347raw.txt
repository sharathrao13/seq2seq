i want you to stay on as an attending physician .
really?
thank you .
hey .
hey .
thank you , dr. walsh .
you've earned it .
unlike some others , you spend more time being concerned with what's best for the patient than kissing my ass .
a risky move , but i like it .
sir , i can't thank you enough for this opportunity .
there's so much i want to do here .
i can't wait to get started .
elizabeth?
yes?
the only thing i need you to do right now is go home .
but , sir , i ...
i have ...
go .
you've been here 26 hours .

dr. masterson .

hey .
i'm sorry i'm late .
i know .
i'm on my way .
don't worry .
your date's late too .
listen .
i have good news .
i got the attending position .
i'm staying in san francisco .
oh , that's great !
well , get over here .
we're breakin 'out the champagne .
i'll be there in a minute .
bye .
this place is heaven .
it's been photographed for magazines .
yeah .
i think i told you i was gonna need something furnished .
well , it is furnished .
where's the couch?
do you believe all of this space?
yeah , it's great for all those raves i'll be throwing .
i'm ... sensing a " no .
wow , huh?
i know .
this place isn't usually available , but the couple's spending all their time in palm springs now .
david , i'm just not quite sure what you're looking for .
maybe if we could communicate a little more .
maybe if you could let me know a bit more about what's going on with you , with your job , your family situation .
i don't wanna talk about that .
stop looking for a couple of months .
start again .
you've gotta know where you wanna live .
i just ...
i'm ...
i'm not ... ... getting what it is you ...
hey , well ... no .
david .
david , are you kidding?
wait , david .
look , come on .
a place like this , it is long gone by now .
no , listen , there's 90 vultures and just one carcass .
all right , fine .
i'll call them .
he did?
ok .
well , right .
as soon as i know .
thank you so much for your help .
well , it's pretty obvious why this hasn't rented .
there's no one year lease .
it's a month to month sublet .
why?
some family matter .
they were pretty close mouthed about it .
wow , what a view .
david .
wow .
this is ... sensational .
oh , my god .
and it's got the private access?
they didn't do much with it , but , i mean , you really could do something with this .
isn't this gorgeous?
well , there's a few places in the richmond we haven't hit yet .
i like the couch .
the couch .
good couch .
good couch .
david .
david , come here .
what?
what?
there's nothing worth stealing here .
there's no money , no drugs .
i'm not stealing anything .
ok .
i'm sure there's a homeless shelter nearby .
i will give you money for cab fare and a good meal .
but please , don't blow it on more beer , ok?
i am not homeless .
i live here .
ok .
you can't live here , because i live here .
this is my apartment .
since when?
since i rented it .
you rented it .
yeah .
you know what?
i don't need this .
what?
rent scam , right?
what are you talking about?
there's probably five other people who paid deposits and got the keys .
and moved in all their things?
yeah ...
what?
this is my stuff .
all of this .
that's my couch , that's my coffee table .
is that a ring?
have you ever heard of a coaster?
or a trash can , for that matter?
i don't care who you are , you're gonna mop that up .
i'm getting the bucket .
it's like a pig moved into my house .
what?
like a filthy pig .
you ...
you moved in when?
hello?
i told you to get out .
jesus !
ok .
so , what's this all about?
what?
nothin '.
nothin '.
so , you called me for nothin '?
i've been sort of seeing someone .
seeing someone?
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
finally .
you think it's a good thing?
absolutely .
yeah .
the last time i tried to hook you up , you bailed out .
this is good , and the fact that you initiated it yourself , that's important .
ok?
now , who is she?
do i know her?
i mean i'm seeing someone that's not there .
she's emotionally unavailable?
you mean like a hallucination .
twice , in my apartment .
a woman .
attractive?
not really there , jack .
right .
right .
ok .
so when you saw this woman , were you drunk?
i mean , i had a little buzz .
dave , don't lie to me , it doesn't help .
ok , fine , i was wasted .
but still , i shouldn't be seeing some little blonde control freak running around my apartment .
why are you writing this down?
this isn't a session .
that's insulting , ok?
i'm your friend jack here , i'm not charging you .
but if this thing rolls into a second hour we're gonna have to work out some kind of deal .
i'm kidding .
so , hold on a second .
you were drunk ,
you saw this blonde , controlling ...
i gotta stop drinkin '.
no .
no?
yeah , drink , party .
just do it with other people .
god gave us alcohol as a social lubricant .
make men brave , make women loose .
what is that , some berkeley shrink thing?
no .
look around you , ok?
see this?
this is the world .
join it .
stop swimming around in your own mind .
that is a dangerous neighborhood you should not go into alone .
come on , dave .
it's been two years , man .
no more hiding out .
absolutely not .
are you insane?
what are you doing?
oh , god , what is this?
i didn't want to , but i will call the police .
i'm sleeping .
it's a dream .
it's one of those dreams and you know you're dreaming .
how do you keep getting in here?
it's you who's in here .
oh , my .
this is more serious than i thought .
go away , you don't exist .
i'm gonna ask you a series of questions .
i want you to answer honestly .
has your recent alcohol consumption increased?
yeah , so?
are you hearing voices or seeing things that aren't quite real to you?
as a matter of fact , yeah .
have you recently sought consult from a mental health care professional?
what?
how do you know?
stay away from me .
do you feel paranoid , like people are out to get you?
why are you asking so many questions?
i'll take that as a " yes " .
listen to me .
you have fantasized , quite convincingly , that you've rented an apartment that , in fact , belongs to somebody else .
pick up that pillow .
pick it up .
it's ok .
there's a small red stain on the back where i once spilled cherry cough syrup .
yes , that's it .
how else would i know that?
or the fact that these sheets that you're now soiling are from nordstrom .
i still have the receipt , it's in that drawer .
open it up and check .
i think you need to come to terms with the fact that you may be mentally ill .
really?
yes .
this is my apartment .
these are my sheets .
that's my nightstand .
that's my picture ...
where's my picture?
what picture?
there was a picture there of my ...
there was a picture right there on the nightstand .
that was empty when i moved in .
it was just there .
you know what?
i've had enough .
i am calling the police .
no , no , no , no .
it's too late .
what'd you do to my phone?
why can't i ...?
you stay right there .
i'm gonna use the one in the kitchen .
hey , grace , david abbott here .
the people who sublet this apartment to me ,
do you have their number?
is something wrong?
no , no .
i was just wondering about the previous tenant , that's all .
well , the woman that i dealt with , she didn't want to talk about it .
it was some kind of tragedy in the family .
i didn't press for details 'cause i don't need any more drama .
you think this girl died?
well , you better hope so .
that's the only way they're gonna get off this month to month thing and give you a real lease .
that's not exactly the reason i was ...
come on , david , grow up .
look , it has a view , a fireplace .
people would kill their grandmothers for a lot less in this city .
can i help you with anything?
no .
i mean , do you believe in this stuff?
well , you don't until you do .
that's a little dated .
i recommend the rosemary preston .
it's totally seminal .
'scuse me .
where's your ufo section?
it's back and to the left .
ufology .
it's not even a real science .
so , what kind of encounter have you had?
encounter?
ectoplasm?
soniferous ether?
i have a killer sance book if you're into communication .
communicating is not her problem .
righteous .
i have exactly what you need .
yeah .
crap !
there .
spirit , awake .
spirit , partake .
spirit , without fear .
spirit , appear .
are ... are you here?
come on , i think you're here .
ok .
i've got a hot , moist cup of coffee in my hand .
there is no coaster on this table .
i'm going to set it down on this lovely mahogany ...
don't you dare !
we ...
we need to talk .
about what?
has it crossed your mind that there might be something a little off about the way you've been spending your days?
actually , yes .
it's weird having a squatter in your living room .
i am not ...
ok , let's start over .
hi , i'm david abbott .
and you are ...?
i am ...
i'm elizabeth .
my name is elizabeth .
you didn't know that .
you ... you had to read that .
i think i know my own name .
ok .
when was the last time that you remember actually talking to someone other than me?
the other day .
the other day .
and ...
and when you're not here , what do you do with the rest of your day?
certainly a lot more than you do , that's for sure .
let's not stray from the point , lizzie .
don't call me lizzie .
i'm not in kindergarten .
my name's elizabeth .
you think .
let me ask you , has anything dramatic happened to you recently?
like what?
i don't know , like dying maybe?
how dare you say that to me?
ok , calm down .
get your hands off of me , you pervert !
calm down .
i'm not ...
i'm not here to hurt you .
i'm trying to help you face the fact that ...
i'm not dead .
look around you .
there should be a bright light .
there's no light .
walk into the light , elizabeth !
there is no light !
i am not dead !
i think i would know if i was dead !
what's happening to me?
you're dead !
stop saying that !
missed .
ok .
ok , that's enough .
that's enough .
you're just giving me a headache !
get off of me !
ok .
all right , all right .
it's not my fault you're the way you are .
i just want you out of my house .
you get out !
rest in peace .
i'm not leaving .
another one , my , my .
golden state playing very well ...
i love ya tomorrow
you're only a day away
tomorrow , tomorrow
i love ya tomorrow
you're only a day away
fine !
the sun'll come out tomorrow
bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
you know what?
that's it .
i've had it with you .
i've tried to be nice , but now you're outta here !
the power of christ compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
he can't even see me .
a little more left .
you're mopping that up .
more , more .
they're gonna set off the smoke detector .
dad , we got it !
all set , sir .
we have the spirit .
a butter dish .
you sure?
oh , definitely .
i have him right here .
i'm gonna go give him a flush .
that's it?
you just sit there?
hey , you want bells and whistles or a reading?
come on .
he can't see me , either .
for some hideous reason , only you can .
ok , there's somethin '.
definitely a presence .
how original .
tell me more .
it's hostile .
wants you outta here .
actually , he's not bad .
you should move , dude .
i should move?
i would .
i like him .
no , i'm not gonna move .
can't you feel that , man?
there's like this cancer causing ray of spirit hate
searing right towards your body .
this kid's got a gift .
i'm not moving !
why not?
it's not like it's that great an apartment .
what?
yes , it is .
it's got a view .
and a fireplace .
whatever , dude .
yo , do you have , like , a diet anything?
i'm , like , 99 . 9 percent parched here .
could really use a cola .
yeah .
come on .
move out?
that ... that can't be it .
could you talk to her and tell her she should pass on?
could you please talk to her?
i'm ignoring you .
i'm ignoring you .
she won't accept that she's dead .
i told her to walk to the light .
she wouldn't do it .
that's because there is no light .
god , you're infuriating !
wait , what's goin 'on?
you know what?
do you think i like this?
do you think this is easy for me?
i know something's different , something is not right .
i'm walking through walls .
you know ,
i don't think i can help you .
this is one of the most alive spirits i've ever been around .
she's not goin 'anywhere .
what do you mean?
i agree with her , dude .
she's not dead .
but you , whoa .
you gotta deal with this ...
'cause seriously , that's like the darkest aura i've ever seen .
suckin 'the life right outta you .
it's killin 'you , man .
you have to let her go , dude .
how can i , when she won't leave?
not your spirit girl .
i'm talkin ''bout the other one .
the one you're keepin 'in here .
that's what's really haunting you , isn't it?
i don't want to talk about that .
i get it .
you were dumped .
probably for some guy who doesn't have a couch fused to his ass .
shut up !
you can dish it out but you can't take it?
you bring father flanagan and the joy luck club to get rid of me .
but i talk about you getting dumped once ...
you don't know what the hell you're talking about .
shut the hell up !
sorry for your loss , bro .
a word to the wise , girl .
show some respect for the dead .
david?
i'm sorry .
it occurred to me now that i ... ... probably don't know you all that well .
i got this place for the roof .
i was gonna do a whole garden out here ... ... eventually , i think .
now i'm babbling .
i ...
i'm really sorry .
most people who deal with loss really find it helpful to talk about things .
i don't want to talk about it !
anger works too .
who was he talking about?
laura .
her name was laura .
who's laura?
she was my wife .
what do you think i am , stupid?
what is this?
oh , come on .
don't .
this is not gonna help .
how would you know?
have you ever been in a bar in your life?
the groundhog emerges !
i didn't think you'd make it .
all right !
all right !
it's jeff , jody , kim , valerie .
this is my buddy , dave .
nice to meet you .
what are you drinkin '?
coffee .
scotch !
don't you dare !
make it a double !
you don't have to wait .
i can start the hangover right now .
yeah .
yeah .
he's excited to be out .
i know !
friday night !
you can't drink these feelings away .
watch me .
so , you ok?
say goodbye , walk to the door , let's get some food in your stomach .
who made you my mother?
did i ...?
how you comin 'along with those hallucinations?
that was nothing .
you're not a well man , david .
it's just a lack of sleep .
sleep?
you gettin 'any?
eight hours .
twelve .
nine , tops .
opium addicts are more alert than you .
will you knock it off .
don't you dare !
don't !
last chance .
what are you gonna do about it?
dave , buddy !
i'm so ...
i'm sorry .
god !
you freak !
dave , that is uncool , man !
good god !
you're gonna thank me for that one day .
for what?
making me look like a lunatic in front of all those people?
why are you still here?
that's a scary question .
i have no idea .
why are you the only one that can see me?
don't ask me .
all i know is when i'm not with you , it's like i don't ... exist .
oh , my god .
maybe i am dead .
oh , come on now .
i'm ...
i'm sorry that i said you're dead .
maybe you're not dead .
maybe you're just very ... light .
if i could just remember something about who i am , or was .
i mean , then i'd know once and for all .
i'm trying to figure it out .
i ...
i just can't do it by myself .
you're not asking me to ... to help you , are you?
look .
you have two realities to choose from .
first one being that a woman has come into your life in a very unconventional way and she happens to need your assistance .
right .
the second one is that you're an insane person , sitting on a park bench talking to yourself .
i think i prefer the first one .
ok .
let's find out who i am .
no .
i think that apartment was vacant .
that was a woman?
nobody live there .
it's like i was a ghost before i was dead .
hi .
can i help you?
finally , somebody normal .
i bet we were friends .
hi , i'm ...
i'm david .
i am a new tenant here .
hi , david , katrina .
come on in .
she's friendly , i like her .
this'll just take a sec .
i have a question .
the apartment upstairs , it belonged to a young woman .
yeah , i think there was somebody up there .
but she was , like , totally antisocial .
ok , maybe we weren't close friends .
kind a like a cat lady , but without any cats .
right?
ok , i think we're done here .
let's go .
ok , thank you .
look .
this is so retro , but i've got a window i can't get open .
she's got to be kidding .
what?
what?
what?
she wants you to come in .
well , if it's painted shut and you use a screwdriver to jam it , it sometimes ...
oh , tried it .
won't budge .
no preliminaries .
incredible .
i'd like to help , but i have dinner plans .
well , i got dessert .
i just threw up in my mouth .
well , ok .
i ...
nice to meet you .
you too , dave .
thanks .
why is she wearing workout clothes?
if you were gonna work out in the middle of the day , the only reason to wear workout clothes , do you really need a push up bra?
the whole point's to strap 'em down .
you're not comin 'with me anymore .
why?
something might jog my memory .
too bad .
you're like an am radio someone shoved in my head and i can't turn off .
you don't think she was completely un classy and predatory?
those happen to be two of men's favorite things .
why don't you just date a pit bull?
maybe i will .
damn it !
what?
i locked my key in the apartment .
there's a spare key under the fire extinguisher .
i mean , i guess she's sexy if you're into that whole tall , big boobs ,
long legs , model y sorta thing .
i guess if you wanna be that guy .
there are five other units here , and not one person even remembers what you look like .
talk about being disconnected .
are you sure you really want that?
yes , i'm sure .
next drawer on the left .
there's a funnel in there too , if you need it .
check it out .
what is it?
new leads .
look , there's an address written on here .
i can't make that out .
is that a five or a six?
i think it's a ...
no , no , no , that's a five .
definitely a five .
so we have an address , a dry cleaning ticket and a book of matches .
you know what that means?
we could start a very small fire?
there's still hope .
oh , yes , these pants were jet black .
armani , i believe .
i remember them .
they were expensive .
do you remember anything else about the woman?
it's important .
she's pleasant , but a little dull maybe .
dull?
dull?
i think of her , i think of sadness , loneliness .
i don't need a psychological profile from this guy .
can we just get the pants?
can i get the pants?
item left too long .
we give them to homeless shelter .
are you insane?
they were armani .
ok , let's go .
are you coming or not?
they're pants , what do you need 'em for?
425 , i think .
look familiar?
not really .
hi .
hello .
can i help you?
hi .
this might sound a little odd , but i was wondering if you knew a certain woman .
blond , about five foot one ...
two .
and a half .
two and a half?
oh , my god .
who are you?
i don't know you .
i ...
did my wife hire you?
i'm sorry , what?
i knew she'd find out .
whatever she's payin 'you , i'll double it .
anything you want .
i'm not looking for money .
donald !
who is it?
that's her .
come back around six .
i'll have a check ready .
wow .
what?
you don't think i actually had sex with that old horndog .
kind a looks that way , lizzie .
it's elizabeth .
and that's disgusting .
well , look on the bright side .
at 6 : 00 , i'm coming into some money .
thank you .
you're welcome .
oh , my god .
maybe i was a slut .
a lonely , home wrecking slut .
so what if i was a slut?
there's nothing wrong with a healthy sexual appetite .
not at all .
look who i'm talking to , mr. tried to feel me up one time .
i'm trying to agree with you .
david .
what?
this is it .
you recognize it?
good .
ok .
come on .
this is moose's .
i love this restaurant .
you ate here a lot .

but what is it?
air is escaping out of the lungs into his chest . ... out of his lungs into his chest .
open his shirt .
open his shirt .
no , you do it .
i'll do it .
a valve at the opening of the lungs .
if it doesn't close , it constricts the lungs and compresses the organs .
i want you to feel for his ribs again .
a little bit lower .
the spot between two ribs , do you feel that?
ok , splash some vodka on it .
all right .
get the knife .

a little bit further .
thank you .
what am i doing with the knife?
make an incision .
you know what?
no .
david , this man's life is at stake .
i ...
i can't stab a man .
ok .
there's nothing to be afraid of .
you're gonna make a hole for the air to escape .
so put the knife on that spot .
oh , my god .
how do you know this?
i don't know , i just do .
now do it !
put the knife there .
now , you're gonna need to push harder than that .
a little bit harder .
oh , god !
ok !
ok , good !
that's enough .
all right , now , take the pourer out of the vodka bottle .
what?
you're doing good .
now ...
hold on .
go .
put the pourer in the hole you made .
what?
it's gonna keep the wound open so air can escape .

i can't .

he's breathing .
he's breathing !
he's breathing !
i'm a doctor .
i'm a doctor !
i know .
thank god .
the ambulance will be here right away .
ask him where the nearest hospital is .
do you know where the nearest hospital is?
a few blocks , st. matthews .
thank you .
st. matthews?
i may have been a home wrecking whore , but i saved lives .
i worked in that hospital .
i know it , it sounds so familiar .
i've never saved a life before .
it's the best .
one minute you're looking at this monitor , it says " game over , " then you bring it back , a little blip and it's there !
what's that?
that's just a little blood .
david?
i work here .
you did?
the receptionist , her name is amita .
it's all coming back to me now .
there's bill and karen and michael and ...
elizabeth?
you mean elizabeth masterson?
masterson .
yes , that's my name .
yes , that's it .
elizabeth masterson .
dr. masterson is ... ... is not active on our staff right now .
hold on .
let me talk to someone .
excuse me , doctor?
oh , no , she's got the tone .
what tone?
the tone .
you're trying to pass the buck onto somebody else to tell you your friend died !
excuse me , sir .
i need you to go to the third floor nurses 'station .
oh , no , it's fran .
she's my mentor .
they wouldn't send us here if it wasn't bad .
mr. abbott?
hi , yes .
fran lo .
nice to meet you .
you've been inquiring about elizabeth masterson?
right .
could you tell me what happened to her?
i need to know your relationship with her .
tell her you're my boyfriend .
she can't tell you anything unless she knows we're intimately connected .
we were romantic with each other .
what do you mean?
you know , boyfriend girlfriend .
i know what romantic means , but i ...
i have a hard time believing that .
what?
why?
what?
why?
elizabeth's whole life was this hospital .
was "?
did she say " was "?
i don't know of a single date she'd ever been on .
we were fairly recent .
i live in her apartment ...
david .
building .
so , you don't know about the accident .
accident .
oh , god , david .
i remember it .
it was awful .
i was ...
i've been away .
it was three months ago .
three months .
i'm sorry .
i was away for awhile on a business trip .
oh , my god .
what was that?
you were , like , flying .
oh , my god .
it's you .
it's you , it's really you .
you're ... you're not dead , you're alive .
i know , david , but i'm in a coma .
this is not good .
well , it's way better than dead .
look at you .
your body is healing , it's ...
you don't have any scars .
you look pretty .
it doesn't matter how i look .
three months , that's a persistent coma .
we're here now .
let's do something .
like what?
like ...
i don't know .
you're the doctor .
right .
right .
forget it .
what?
i was gonna say that we ...
i need to find a way to put myself together again .
ok , good , good .
that's great .
how do we do that?
maybe i should try this .
something's happening !
yeah , yeah , yeah !
i think it's working !
yeah?
no .
let me try again .
i mean , really focus on it .
hold on inside there .
i'm not sticking .
it's like i'm no longer connected to this body .
all right , all right , all right , all right .
turn around .
what?
i want to try something .
ok .
you felt that .
my hand tingled .
you are still connected to your body .
the monitor doesn't agree .
machines don't know everything .
everything in my training tells me they do .
then how are we having this conversation?
i don't know .
mr. abbott?
i'm sorry .
i have an appointment , and i can't leave you here unattended .
can i just have a couple more minutes , please?
i'm saying goodbye .
of course .
thank you .
my nieces must have made these things for me .
wow , that's an amazing likeness .
look at this .
that's the picture from my nightstand .
abby must have brought it .
you look great .
look at me now .
these levels aren't changing , david .
if anything , they're decreasing .
i'm gonna have to leave soon .
all right .
want me to wait downstairs in the lobby?
no , no , that's sweet .
you should go .
thank you for helping me .
it was my pleasure .
are you sure you don't want to come back with me?
after all , it is your apartment .
it's fine .
after i made it here , i ... ... can't imagine leaving myself , you know?
ok , i know , i just ...
it just feels weird leaving you here alone .
i don't know where else i belong .
mr. abbott .
i'm sorry .
goodbye , elizabeth .
goodbye .
oh , i hate this .
she finally gets a life , and then ...
you know what?
that guy was cute .
at least she got a chance to hang with him for a little while .
yeah .
it woulda been awful if she'd gone through her whole life not knowing what it was all about .
oh , my god .
jenny?
no wonder i could never find you .
i guess you got my job .
yeah .
i think i've earned it .
i deserve it .
everything you thought it would be?
it is .
and it's time to upgrade from the 330 to the 740 .
i'm goin 'to the dealer tonight .
hold on .
it's walsh , i have to take this .
hello?
really?
you want me to do it?
sure , of course i can .
dude , did you know i can get a built in jack for my ipod?
did you know there's people out there dying?
i'm in a coma , have you noticed?
i know .
sweet !
zoe?
lily vanilli?
oh , my god , you guys got so big !
beat ya !
did not !
did too !
did not !
did too !
did not !
did too !
how could i feel him and not you guys?
did not !
did too !
oh , that's funny .
abby .
i remember saying no running , no screaming !
abby , can you feel me?
all right , chill , i'm serious .
i guess not .
i hope you feel better .
get well soon .
i love you .
i remember when you pushed us ...
it's so sweet you guys come and visit me .
and i really miss ...
excuse me .
mrs. brody , hi .
hi .
dr. rushton .
could i have a quick word?
sure .
what do you want?
first of all , i hope you know how much we all love and miss elizabeth .
please .
he's doing high fives he's not in phoenix .
because she was a senior resident here , we've taken some extraordinary measures to make her feel more comfortable these last three months .
lily !
turn it back !
zoe , what did we talk about?
watch your sister .
sorry .
this is hard to say .
when we come to work here , we are asked to sign release forms .
ok .
i don't like the sound of this .
did you know your sister's opinion about artificially prolonging life?
no .
she was against it .
really?
ok , that was before .
i am completely for it now .
honestly , most in our profession feel that way .
not me !
i'm perfectly happy .
come on , abby !
you have got to feel me , i'm your sister !
but there's still some brain activity , isn't there?
people have woken up from this kind of coma .
all the time .
not on any record i've found .
of course they have !
otherwise , what am i doing here?
i feel car sick .
what are you doing?
we're looking for the stick .
what stick?
you said she had a stick up her ...
stop it !
come on .
tv is going to become a very dim memory for you two .
mrs. brody , elizabeth did sign a release .
because of the special situation , we won't take any terminal action without your explicit approval .
now , i've prepared this paperwork ...
don't sign that .
i'm here ! ... if you decide to sign ...
i'll think about it .
abby , i'll baby sit more , i swear !
those jeans you love?
they're yours !
we sometimes find that it's easier just to ask god's forgiveness and not prolong the inevitable .
i said i'd think about it .
thank you , abby .
you always looked out for me .
you here?
i guess not .
i'm locked out .
doesn't this location make san francisco bearable?
wait , you're not from here , are you?
oh , good .
and what's with all the single men in this town?
every time i meet a good looking guy ... lesbian .
it's tough .
i'd get on the phone and i'd be like ,
hello?
osama?
communism is so over .
like , give your people toilet paper .
so , like , if i had to choose?
if i had to choose .
wow .
i guess i'd have to go with the midget .
i'm sorry ...
the locksmith , does he know to ring my unit?
i think so .
where's your bathroom?
it's right down the hall there .
ok .
elizabeth !
yeah .
no , i just ...
i didn't think you were gonna come back .
i thought you were gonna stay at the hospital with your body .
it's terrible .
they're trying to get my sister to sign papers authorizing permission to take me off of life support .
no !
what?
they can't do that !
i know .
i said that .
nobody could hear me .
and i just wanted to talk to you .
david !
just a minute !
well , that didn't take very long .
no .
no , she barged in .
she got locked out of her apartment .
you don't have to explain .
i get it .
no , you don't get anything .
she's using the bathroom ...
her voice sounded like it came from the bedroom .
it did?
come here .
i want to show you something .
when you know , you know , right?
i had no idea that's ...
you had no idea she was naked on your bed .
no .
you're wondering what she looks like .
no , i'm not .
a little?
not enough to go look .
tell you what .
i'll do a little recon for ya .
please don't !
don't worry .
i'm a doctor .
elizabeth .
no , no , no , no , no .
relax .
she's got a tattoo on her ass .
it says " all aboard .
really?
in three languages .
oh , that's funny .
she's very cultural .
you know , you sound jealous .
oh , please .
you do .
are you talkin 'to someone?
hey , what's goin 'on?
eyes up top , david .
nothing .
look , i'm sorry if i'm coming on a little too strong .
that's just my style .
i hear you sometimes .
up here ... ... by yourself ...
and i just figured ... ... maybe he's lonely .
i know i am .
is it wrong for me to want to touch someone?
to be close?
feel a warm body next to me?
david , just do it .
what?
go ahead , be with her .
it's what you both want .
no , it isn't .
are you all right?
do you ... wanna take some kind of medication first?
it's cool if you do .
david , it's ok .
she's beautiful , and she's right here in front of you .
and i'm in the way .
no , you're not .
elizabeth .
elizabeth !
it's katrina .
that was quick .
come on , nothing happened .
what'd you say to her?
that i was seeing someone .
honestly?
well , i didn't mention that i was the only person who could .
you know , i haven't ... ... haven't really been with anyone since ... ... since laura .
she was cursing at her shoe .
her heel had broken .
and then she just kind a sat down and put her hand to her head .
oerebral hemorrhage?
and ...
i couldn't do anything to help her .
she was , like , gone .
i couldn't even say goodbye , and she was just ...
she's gone .
what was she like?
you know , she was just a big pain in the ass .
no , really .
i mean , the bras on the doorknobs ,
leaving the car with the ... with the gas needle below empty .
she couldn't put gas in the car .
it was impossible for her .
and just total stubborn inability to master a remote .
so she would just randomly click buttons , until the tv was snarled into some unmanageable condition .
i mean , i'm so ...
i'm mad just thinking ...
... thinking about her .
i'm sorry , david .
your sister really wouldn't sign those papers , would she?
i don't know .
i hope not .
won't even matter if i don't wake up soon .
my brain activity's decreasing every day .
maybe that's not such a bad thing .
you're kind of a smarty pants .
no , it'll bring you down to my level .
you're not dumb , david , just a little lazy .
cute , but lazy .
thank you .
i wasn't always like this , you know .
what were you like?
come on .
i want to show you something .
where are we?
it's an estate .
the guy's in hawaii this time of year .
are we trespassing?
don't worry , we're not going inside .
here it is .
you said you love gardens .
what is this place?
i made this place .
this is my work .
i was a landscape architect .
i had my own company for awhile .
david , i've been here before .
what do you mean?
i know this is gonna sound really strange , but i dreamed of this place .
these flowers , everything .
it's beautiful .
i had no idea , david .
what a joy it must be to create a place like this .
yeah , it was .
is it gonna be again?
sure .
promise?
who the hell's calling me?
hello?
david , it's grace .
well , you are the luckiest man in san francisco .
thank you .
why do you say that?
great news , the apartment is yours .
and they're willing to give you a nice long lease .
how long a lease?
really long .
and i'm gonna send it over ,
and i'll talk to you tomorrow .
wait , wait , wait .
why are they giving me a long lease now?
it's a terrible story .
the tenant was in some kind of coma , and it is what it is , so they're gonna pull the plug .
they are gonna throw in that couch you like .
david?
what?
we gotta go talk to your sister .
why?
what are you gonna say to her?
i don't know .
what kind of dirt do you have on her?
her middle name is ellen .
in the third grade she told everybody it was leia , like princess leia .
what else?
she's lactose intolerant .
all right , the only way this is gonna work is if i could tell her something that only you know .
something so intimate , so personal ...
she french kissed her ex boyfriend j. j. five minutes before her wedding .
oh , that'll work .
that's good .
nobody knows that .
that ...
i think i like her already .
so , how did you know elizabeth?
you must've worked together .
god knows she wasn't dating anybody .
everybody likes to rub that one in .
actually , this is gonna be a little difficult to swallow ...
tea !
my nieces are here?
they're supposed to be at school .
hi .
would you like some tea , sir?
well , yes , thank you , madam .
abort .
don't do this in front of them , it's gonna freak them out .
i'm sorry , you were saying?
how did you know her?
lie your butt off .
we worked together .
no !
no .
no , no , no .
you're not credible as a doctor .
make something up .
i mean , i didn't work with her .
we worked together on my illness .
i was a patient of hers .
lily?
can you see me?
i was sick .
i had meningitis .
spiral meningitis .
i'm so sorry .
spiral meningitis?
it's not a disease .
oh , no , it's ok .
i'm much better now .
i ...
elizabeth , she believed in me , believed that i would recover when nobody else did .
and then i did .
that sounds just like her .
but why are you telling me this?
because i know about elizabeth's situation , and i just wanna say that ...
lily . ... there are things ...
you know i'm here , don't you? ... sometimes that ... ... that are beyond our understanding .
and so , i just wanted to ask you ...
actually , i just want to beg you to ... to give her a little bit more time .
she's gonna pull through this thing .
i just know it .
that's really sweet of you to say , but ... it's kind a too late .
abby .
what do you mean?
abby , what did you do?
it's david , right?
you see , it's too late because i've already signed the papers .
abby .
i'm here .
can you feel me?
i'm right here .
we're terminating life support tomorrow at noon , while the girls are in school .
i mean , the past three months have been so hard on them , on this whole family .
well , i understand that .
i really do .
but i think you're makin 'a grave mistake here ,
because i really believe ...
it's for the best .
really .
this is what elizabeth wanted .
i mean , i spent my whole life thinking i knew what was best for her .
what she should wear , what men she should date .
this is the last thing elizabeth asked for .
and for the first time in my life , i'm gonna respect her wishes .
oh , abby .
look .
this is gonna sound really strange to you , but ...
oh , no , no , no . ... the truth is elizabeth is here with us right now .
she came here with me , she's standing next to you , begging you to wait .
right next to me?
right there .
david , stop .
no , let me do this .
i don't know how or why , but somehow i can see your sister's spirit .
i know it's crazy , but i also can talk to her .
so why don't i have her just explain the whole thing to you , and i'll translate .
could you just hold on , just a sec?
ok , tea party's over .
time for wiggly safari !
yeah !
ok , david , this could work .
i think i was getting through to her .
you need to get her to the hospital .
right to the hospital .
we'll get her to rip those papers ...
get the hell outta here , you freak !
i'm not makin 'this up !
why would i?
abby , calm down , just calm down !
i'll chop you !
i swear , i will chop you !
tell about j. j. i know about j. j.
what?
i know what you did with j. j.
i'll tell everybody .
how do you know that?
nobody knows that !
get outta here !
get going !
you kids ok?
mommy , is auntie elizabeth gonna have more tea?
what?
i don't think your sister's a very spiritual person .
she's just bein 'a good mom .
tryin 'to keep her kids away from a crazy guy .
i think i would have liked to have been a mom .
you'd make a good one .
thanks .
guess i'll never really know .
come on , lizzie .
this can't be it .
lizzie?
ok , i'm sorry .
i know you don't like to be called that .
i'm warming up to it .
i can go to that hospital .
i could talk to your friend , fran .
i could ...
no , david . ... talk to the asshole guy .
brett?
no .
just stop , they'll put you in a straitjacket .
there's no way anyone's gonna believe i'm still here .
your niece , the little girl .
she saw you .
oh , great .
my fate's in the hands of a four year old who has seven other imaginary friends .
wait .
there is someone else .
what do you mean?
come on .
darryl !
dude .
yeah .
the spirit's with you , isn't it?
you can't bring that here .
what are you thinking , bro?
you were right .
she's alive .
righteous .
she's in a coma .
her family's gonna take her off life support .
not so righteous .
so , what , are you guys socializing now?
we've ... acclimated .
yeah , i can tell .
in fact , i'm sensin 'some pretty intense feelings she has for you , bro .
really?
no , i don't .
major red aura .
somebody's embarrassed .
i am not .
can we focus here?
ok .
ask him if there's a spell ...
or a chant .
anything to get ...
my spirit ... ... back into her body?
you're asking the wrong question .
why is that wrong?
look , i have the gift .
i didn't ask for it , but i do .
i can sense these things , spirits , whatever you wanna call 'em .
why they're hangin 'here in the first place?
that's their unfinished business .
do i have the gift?
dude , please .
you definitely don't have it .
you're a civilian .
but if i don't have it , how is it that i can see her and talk to her when no one else can?
exactly .
exactly what?
that's the right question .
what the hell is he talking about?
god , i feel like it's right there in front of us .
i just can't get a handle on it .
how do you solve a problem that isn't possible in the first place?
because nothing seems impossible to me anymore .
i mean , why did i move into your apartment in the first place?
why can i see you when no one else can?
i mean , why was i down in that restaurant when that guy collapsed?
it all seems interrelated somehow .
what are you doing?
i don't know .
i feel like i missed something here .
wait a second .
rosemary preston lives right here in san francisco .
we could go talk to her .
i'll call information , maybe she's listed .
where did you get this?
it was just at the hospital .
yeah .
i ...
i took it .
i'm sorry .
i ...
i just ...
i wanted to have a picture of you .
i wasn't sure that i was gonna ever see you again .
i'm sorry .
don't be sorry .
that's really nice .
i really like that picture .
yeah .
yeah , i liked it too .
i had just gotten my moat scores back .
well , you must've done well .
no , actually , i bombed .
my scores were so low
i couldn't even get into correspondence school .
and that's a good thing?
no .
i know it sounds kind a crazy .
i wanted to go back to the library and start studying immediately , but abby said no .
the only thing to do was to burn my scores and drink margaritas .
lots and lots of margaritas .
well , looks like she was right .
it's just funny because the one time i completely failed at something ,
i had more fun than i'd ever had in my life .
you look happy .
i was happy .
but what was i doing with the rest of my time?
when i think about my life and i ...
all i can remember is working .
you know?
working and working and trying so hard .
and for what?
you help people .
you save lives .
yeah .
including my own .
i saved my life , for later .
i just ...
i never thought there wouldn't be a later .
no , don't say that .
there's still time .
we're gonna see this lady ...
you know , i just don't want to spend my last night crying .
or ... fighting my fate .
i wanna do something with you .
ok .
ok , great .
what do you want to do?
you want to fly to paris?
see the eiffel tower?
no problem .
you wanna dance on a beach in bali?
let's go !
let's do it !
anywhere in the world that will take mastercard or visa .
anywhere .
there is something that i would like to do .
anything .
i'm so bad at this .
what?
what is it?
are you nervous?
a little .
why?
i don't know .
how can you be nervous when i can't even touch you?
i think i'm more nervous because you can't touch me .
why?
you know in the hospital when you touched my hand?
i felt it .
i mean , my spirit felt it .
i don't know how .
but i think if you could ever really touch me ... ... i might wake up from all of this .
i can almost feel that .
me too .
i think i know what my unfinished business is .
what?
you .
elizabeth .
elizabeth?
elizabeth? !
i'm right here .
oh , good , good .
i thought you were gone .
suddenly i know what i'm supposed to do , because this time i can do something .
what are you talking about?
lizzie , when we first met , i kept saying that you were dead .
but it was me that was dead , and you brought me back .
you saved me .
and now it's my turn to save you .
how?
i'm gonna steal your body .
david .
david .
david , what are you thinking?
you can't do this !
why can't i?
because you'll go to jail .
so?
if something happens to you , you think i care where i'll be?
at least this'll buy us a little more time .
the things you'd have to know to even start to pull this off ...
you know them .
you'll talk me through it .
ok , you're gonna need a van .
and somebody with no morals .
what are we movin 'again?
medical supplies .
you didn't tell him?
you have to .
you know , he looks really familiar to me .
you saw him at the bar .
saw who at the bar?
no one , never mind .
here we go !
ok , and we're in such a hurry to move this stuff because why?
there's a one day sale on hospital beds .

dave , what the hell are you doing?
this isn't a sale , man !
all right .
i knew you wouldn't come if i told you .
do i really want to hear this?
my imaginary friend is not imaginary .
she is the spirit of a girl in a coma upstairs who they're about to take off life support .
we've got to get her someplace safe .
really?

you should've told him .
he wouldn't have believed me .

ok , sometimes people with emotional and mental disturbances can have psychic moments .
but even if she was real , do you know what you're risking for this woman?
yes !
why?
because i love her .

no one's ever said that to me before .
david?
what?
tell him thank you .
we're really grateful , jack .
