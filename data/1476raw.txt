i won't let anyone come between us anymore ...
are they recording?
help !
cigarette .
light .
i don't believe the dream i just had .
i was in a forest running barefoot .
i was hurt , and i was being followed by somebody .
the more i ran the more i felt him coming closer .
who was the guy stalking you?
it wasn't a guy .
it was me .
that's the weirdest part .
it was me running after me .
can't you have normal dreams like everyone else?
no .
being like everyone else is an awful bore !
we shouldn't have gone out last night .
i'm exhausted .
take a rest .
i'll wake you when we get there .
yeah , very funny !
i'll drive , if you like .
y'mean like last time?
oh come on .
it was late , and i felt tired .
felt tired , huh?
you were dead drunk !
well , it was your fault for dumping me for three hours and disappearing with god knows who !
i hope at least that he was worth it .
i'll say !
unbelievable !
you're really a bitch .
bastard !
maneater !
badlay !
anybody's !
cheap hooker !
are there any cool places to go in the country?
well , there's a town hall but that's about it .
wow , if i had to live here all year round i think i'd shoot myself ..
it's another kind of rhythm .
it's different .
besides , we didn't come here to go partying .
we're here to study ...
hey , we're not deaf !
chill out marie !
c'mon hendrix , run !
bang !
bang !
bang !
tom , stop shouting for a minute .
you're giving me a headache !
how long do we have to wait for alex , huh?
she'll be here after you've had your bath .
no , because alex has never seen this cowboy suit .
tom , go and have your bath and then you can put your cowboy suit back on again .
okay?
bang , bang , bang !
come on , hendrix , bang , bang !
good ... more ... more ...
watch the road !
you've still got some make up on , y'know .
are you sure it's this way?
of course i'm sure . in fifty meters , you go right at the corn field there it is .
turn right and then go straight for four kilometers .
you really know your way around .
nobody takes this road except for tractors .
four kilometers of this and it's good bye car .
you can't act that way whenever a guy tries to talk to you .
i don't act that way with everyone .
come off it , marie .
it's always the same story .
stop !
what's wrong?
i saw someone !
hey , that's not funny , alex !
no , i'm not kidding .
i saw someone .
i swear .
stop screwing around like that will you !
alex , come back here , please !
damn it !
alex !
if this is a joke i'll make you regret it !
alex , where are you?
where are you?
i'll get you .
if you think you're being funny you've got another thing coming !
alex?
alex !
stop , you bitch , and come back !
i'm sick of your little game !
enough is enough !
god damn you !
what if i had left you out here?
yeah , very funny !
you scared the hell out of me !
here we are .
okay , now i know why you passed your exams so easily .
if you spend all weekends up here , there's not much else to do except study !
y'can't beat it for peace and quiet .
you can hear the train go by but that's it .
easy hendrix , easy .
how are you?
hello dad .
don't worry .
he doesn't bite .
you talking about me or the dog?
marie , this is my father .
pop , marie .
nice to meet you .
so , i finally see you in person and not just in a photo .
photo?
you know , the one i took in spain .
yes , it's on the fireplace .
you were living here .
and this is tom .
hi cowboy .
hey , are you happy to see me , partner?
of course , he's happy .
he has been waiting for you all this evening .
and your mother's been worrying all day .
it's okay , .
mom always worries for nothing .
i think she left you something in the oven .
but i told her we'd manage and not to bother .
she didn't know if you'd have time to eat on the way .
that's mom !
i'll put tom thumb to bed and show marie her room .
right .
i'll leave you then .
i have some work to finish .
g'night .
sleep well .
see you tomorrow .
good night, sir .
sleep tight .
did your dad build this place?
it was an old farm that he renovated .
there are lots of them in the region .
most of them are ruins .
it's a pity .
they've lived here for five years now .
did they have problems with the neighbors?
with the local yokels?
at first , they took my folks for a couple of hippies who came to make goat cheese , but now it's fine .
well , that's my room .
there .
this way now .
my parents 'room's on the right .
tom's room is there .
yours is upstairs , guest room .
just two seconds .
i'll put him to bed first .
alexia , is that you?
that's my mother .
go on .
i'll be right up .
hi mom .
is your friend all settled in?
show her where the blankets are .
if she needs towels there are clean ones in the closet .
your own private bathroom .
great , huh?
the heating's electric .
should i turn it on?
no , i can do it if i get cold .
well , what do you think?
it's like a doll's house ... very pretty .
the problem is he's got a girlfriend he doesn't seem to want to split up with .
why're you so interested then?
someone who's taken can't be all that bad .
i'm always suspicious of guys who are free .
here .
want some more?
no thanks .
well , i think it's too easy to be a womanizer when you're already taken .
maybe i'm just trying to convince myself ...
maybe he doesn't like me at all .
what's his girlfriend like?
she's brazilian .
they've been together three months .
what's he doing with a brazilian? is that his way of getting cheap thrills?
anyway , i've gotta get a suntan fast ... and firm up my ass a little too .
you should see the way she's built !
if you do salsa i'll go with you .
don't get them excited or they'll keep us up all night !
hey , what about you?
when are you gonna finally try yourluck?
don't start with that .
you're gonna end up an old maid , marie .
i'm not hot to trot like you !
no , you're scared , that's all !
enough .
i'm gonna have a smoke outside .
how about you?
no , i'm going to bed .
i'm wiped out .
don't stay up too late .
i'll wake you at nine .
what's the game plan?
we'll start with international law .
okay?
okay .
g'night alex .
good night .
hey alex , i'm glad that i finally met your family .
c'mon hendrix .

how could i get the number?
i told you i was inside the truck !
do you realize how many pickup trucks there are on the road?
