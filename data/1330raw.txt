what if i told you ...
i know exactly what you do ! and how you do it ! and i think it's despicable .
you know what?
we might need to go out to dinner .
yeah , there is a great sea food restaurant i love to take you to .
how about you just get a cleaver butcher?
maybe i will !
what the hell is wrong with you !
even a front page story can't cure .

albert and allegra to fill your crappy newspaper .
you put them there !
no , you did !

that sounds good to me .
that's true , you can't tell him if you like him .
yar , i tried that once and it didn't go well ...
that is what you did ! and i did like you !
i just didn't know i was been worked over by some professional !
he doesn't have badge .

i am sorry to interrupt ... do i know you?
no , i don't think so .
you wanna see you being spontaneous?
sure , you wanna benedryl?

mrs. cole , thanks very very much for seeing me .
you said it was a matter of life and death .
that man would have sold his soul to make you happy .

the devil?
my job is not to deceive , mrs. cole .
is to create opportunities .
like the boardroom?
would you have noticed him otherwise?
yes !
really?
eventually
maybe
how did you know all the stuff about me?
well , you really did your homework .
like the boarding school when everyone used to tease me because i couldn't whistle . and having him dance like a buffoon knowing that i can't dance either .
and telling him to drop mustard on his shirt
so i feel less like a dork .
that was all you?
right?
no , hell no !
that was him?
that's got albert written all over it .
did you put him up the inhaler?
stop it !
he did not show you that !
he chucked it right before he kissed me .
so , so , wait , that , that stuff work for you?
it was adorable .

you will never be fine and neither will i !
maybe i should drive .
are you trying to get yourself killed?
if that's what it takes .
