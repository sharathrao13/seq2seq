there's no room !
he'll soon be back .
do you think so?
is he your husband?
which branch is he in?
infantry .
and you?
engineers , the smart lot .
can't you tell?
excuse me ...
forgive me for insisting but i'd like to buy you a drink .
my last before the war ...
not all of us have a pretty woman to see us off .
don't you have a friend?
well?
shall we move on?
aren't you singing?
you like war?
you're going to shoot at strangers?
want to sing with the krauts?
why don't you like peace?
we're at war !
the krauts are knocking at our door !
fighting won't bring us peace .
doesn't your country mean anything?
what did you learn at school?
why's the lieutenant so quiet?
he doesn't like war either .
he's scared .
let's go .
go off and fight !
go , prove you're a real man !
i don't understand .
look at them run .
it's absurd !
go on , catch your train .
leave me now .
your eyes contain no hate ...
you're young ...
i don't even know your name .
clmence .
no clemency in wartime ...
what's going on?
a spooked stallion , sir .
who requisitioned a stallion?
geld the animal !
what happened?
a stallion , sir .
a kick in the gut .
what should i do?
fetch the chaplain .
lieutenant fournier reporting , sir .
at ease ...
i see in your file that you've studied engineering ...
yes , sir .
i need a bridge built .
take a detachment and find a suitable spot near chaumont .
by the way , you don't happen to be related to colonel fournier at headquarters?
your father , perhaps?
my father's dead .
how are your men?
a little edgy , sir .
the germans won't be here for a day or two .
fancy a glass , lieutenant?
it shouldn't last too long .
what do you think?
he arrived this morning .
no one has dared touch him .
found six days ago ...
his lingual artery has been clogged by mud .
he'd have bled to death otherwise .
a pity he didn't ...
is that him stinking like that?
get him a medal while there's still time .
what does he want?
do you think he can hear?
you want to say something?
can you hear me?
i don't think he can hear .
i can hear yoi !
you're alive , old chap .
you're alive !
where am i?
the face is split open from the chin to halfway up the nose , with destruction of upper right jawbone and palate .
partial destruction of the tongue , organs at the rear of the throat unprotected ...
am i making that noise?
clean him and move him to the rear .
i can't do anything here .
i can't speak anymore .
i can't speak anymore !
calm down .
let's see ...
i can move my feet ...
both of them .
my hands ...
my hands are tied .
i can't find my teeth ...
i can't feel my teeth anymore !
my teeth have gone ...
my palate too ...
god , what has happened to me?
it hirts ...
i hate that noise .
has the war started?
are you all right?
bit hot , isn't it?
get rid of these two , they're dead .
we've got two others for you .
don't worry ...
we'll clean you up .
give them water , they're bloody suffocating !
god , what a stink !
here , drink this .
how can i make this one drink?
he'll be all right till evening .
are you in pain?
we've run out of morphine , and all the rest .
hang on !
you'll be in paris by morning .
the war's over for you .
you'd rather have the rain?
which one's the officer?
this one , i think .
are you an officer?
shelter him .
he wants the rain , he's feverish .
take him to the officers 'ward .
are you awake?
you mustn't sleep all the time .
it's midday .
aren't you hungry?
let me help you to sit up .
is he awake?
good day , lieutenant .
can you hear me?
not too lonely?
that'll soon change , i fear .
are you in pain?
you're not the kind to complain .
we'll feed you to build you back up .
i'll operate in a few days , to tidy you up .
then a long rest before we move onto serious things .
you're in no hurry to fight again?
does that hurt?
arms or legs are easy , we just lop them off .
ajawbone is different .
a bone graft may well take .
it's fascinating work .
more for me than for you , of course .
concentrate on two things : breathe well and eat well .
i'll see to the rest .
in a few months , you'll be as right as rain .
i'll be in to see you every morning .
give him morphine if he's in pain .
but don't let him get used to it .
it's in short supply .
good bye , lieutenant .
if you want to say something , write it down .
oh , i'm sorry .
it's not too hot?
that's good .
let's take a little break .
is it good?
you can't tell .
thank you
anais .
and you're adrien .
i have a son a bit younger than you .
he's on the belgian front .
the news isn't good .
it's quiet up here .
downstairs , we're running out of space .
i've brought you paper to write home .
to set your mother's mind at rest .
i don't want my mother to see me like this .
nor anyone else either .
thank god they're far away .
stay where yoi are .
i'll visit as soon as i can .
things are chaotic here with all the wounded .
visitors aren't allowed .
my war's over .
i've done my duty .
that's what matters .
no vital parts have been hit , not my eyes , legs or arms .
just a fractured collarbone .
i'll write as often as i can .
i'm perfectly safe here .
adrien .
no vital parts have been hit .
the collarbone ...
the collarbone's nothing !
do you think it will last long?
what's all that noise?
they've tied me down again .
why can't i see anything?
what's that i feel?
he's operated on me .
he can't have done much , it's still as empty .
and that noise ...
i won't speak again .
i'd rather not speak .
there's another man ...
they're worried i might scare him .
i'm the one who's scared .
the thought of it scares me .
already awake?
how do you feel today?
does it feel tight?
torn flesh contracts .
i've stretched it again .
now , we can rebuild .
i'll use newborn baby bone .
they'll let us know when one dies .
we have to bide our time .
breathe well , eat well .
no soup tonight .
you're hot .
you have a fever .
you're hot ...
you have a fever .
only deer antlers ever grow back .
he has to use deer horn .
i must stop thinking aboit her .
that's all dead now .
i must tell him to use deer horn on me .
excuse me ...
lieutenant fournier .
are you family?
we were students together .
i got his letter this morning .
how bad is he?
it's hot .
here .
you have to be brave .
is he dead?
no .
is he going to die?
no .
he needs peace and quiet .
don't look away , that would hurt him even more .
he's on the second floor .
the first ward .
adrien?
i'm sorry ...
you want me to fetch your mail?
the janitor has the keys?
i'll go round .
i've brought you some ...
go away
i'll come back soon , i promise .
you're a hero , adrien , a real hero .
dementia
lieutenant fournier .
wounded at the start of fighting .
the other two men are still unconscious ,
minister .
lieutenant , i'm here to express the country's gratitude for the bravery and sacrifice that you have shown .
without men like you , the land of our fathers , that we must hand on to our children , would be overtaken by barbarity .
we're proud of you .
where are you from , lieutenant?
he can't speak yet , minister .
i hope he can hear me at least .
your words have been noted for the press , minister .
good .
how many weeks will it be until he's up and about?
months would be more appropriate , sir .
ready to get back to the front?
we need men like you .
good bye .
why are you out of bed?
you mustn't .
you might fall .
the sight that would have been ...
he congratulated you .
you can be proud of yourself .
he's already forgotten me .
but i'm grateful .
at least he didn't grimace on seeing me .
months woild be more appropriate ...
he thinks the war's going to last ...
his stomach can't take it .
it's notjist my stomach .
i want to know what i look like .
i want to see .
you'll feel better in a few days .
mirror
the doctor said no .
if it was that bad , i couldn't look at you .
i can see your whole soul in your eyes .
what state is that one in?
i won't bother getting ip .
i'll see him soon enoigh .
i couldn't come any sooner .
this is all i found , on the table .
dear adrien , meeting again would be madness .
don't be angry .
you understand why .
i'll never forget yoir eyes ,
yoir smile and yoir touch .
i wish you the best of luck .
clmence .
i've brought the papers .
do you read a bit?
no , it tires you .
should i try to find her?
berthelot and roy have hired me .
i design gun barrel casings .
that way i feel useful .
i'm painting again .
it's pathetic in wartime but it helps me forget .
when i paint , i'm in another world .
draw me
no , i can't .
why are you here?
you can't stay here .
off you go !
why aren't we dead?
i'd just flown over the front on my way back .
suddenly , a hail of bullets .
two krauts .
i never saw them coming .
my plane caught fire .
this tree came up at me .
the rest's a blank .
your uncle's downstairs .
please ...
he wants to reassure your mother .
what shall i tell him?
you can't hide forever .
we'll pill through
it snowed this morning .
we were at the window like children .
two nurses threw snowballs .
we almost went and joined them .
our uncle came .
i warned you they'd turn him away .
he left me some ham , sausage and tobacco .
i shared it with the others .
pierre , a pilot , henri , a breton ,
and loiis , a new arrival .
i've brought you some cigarettes .
nice smell?
we had a proper christmas .
i'd have liked to be with you .
bit the nirses , especially anais ,
helped us forget the war and the ward .
sometimes ,
i forget i've been woinded .
how's the graft taking?
you'll have a greek nose .
no , a jewish one .
all right ...
so my mother will know me .
she'll know you , i promise .
open your mouth .
speak .
what's your name?
henri ...
did you hear that?
you will too .
i'm operating tomorrow .
a baby died last night .
they're preparing everything .
you'll wake tomorrow with a brand new mouth .
it's a world first .
medicine is making giant strides .
can i speak?
i can't do it .
i'll never manage it .
it's no use ...
it hirts .
are you all right?
there's a corpse in my mouth .
does it hurt?
i wish it was daytime .
i'm scared .
i'm going to pray for you .
you'll be all right .
i don't believe in god .
it's absurd .
i have to calm myself down .
i've never known anyone so calm .
what's all this?
it's him .
his face gives me nightmares .
how do you feel today?
they're sending two other girls up .
the chief medical officer blew his top .
there was a bit of flirting going on downstairs .
ccile ...
adrien's been here for six months .
he's a bit like a son for me .
flirting while her husband's on the front?
clmence didn't even wait .
i'll be right back .
i'll find her .
i'm already old , i'm a monster .
i want to see her fade , grow ugly and wrinkled ...
this girl's pretty .
i want to touch her .
sorry , did i hurt you?
why is it hirting today?
i mistn't think about the pain .
is that better?
her skin's so soft ...
tell me if i'm hurting you .
