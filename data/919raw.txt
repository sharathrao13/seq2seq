here i am !
who's this?
look at that .
watch that ladder .
what happened?
let me try something here .
what is it?
what's gone wrong here , then?
won't work , huh?
here we go .
what are you guys looking at?
get me out of here !
here !
it's mine !
do you mind?
taxi !
taxi !
taxi !
come on .
jacques !
jacques , you're late !
i'm late .
i have to mow mrs. oglethorpe's lawn .
stop that !
stop that !
stop that !
you moron .
there will be changes around here after today , and i will personally see that you will be the first one to go .
allow me .
wipe off those filthy hands !
take this .
oh , for me?
carry it to the house , you idiot !
here you are , my dear .
do come in , edmund .
my dear lillian .
i'm so sorry i'm late , but there's so much to do in handling the oglethorpe enterprises now that dear oscar has passed on .
you are a good friend , edmund .
and such a comfort in my time of need .
i hope more than a friend , lillian .
as the lawyer for the oglethorpe family ,
i have been entrusted with the last will and testament of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
edmund , i beg your pardon .
yes , dear lady?
i must apologize , but we really must wait for my personal solicitor , roland t. flakfizer .
jacques .
lillian ,
i've been employed by your late husband for over 1 3 years .
are you dismissing me?
good heavens , no , edmund .
i was involved in a minor accident with the bentley last year .
miraculously , he was by my side to assist me .
oh , jacques , i want you to go to this address and summon this gentleman at once .
i've been calling all morning and leaving messages .
i can't seem to reach him .
yes , mrs. o ...
lillian , how long must we wait?
i can assure you , once mr. flakfizer receives my message , he will race to be by my side .
anyone hurt?
roland t. flakfizer , attorney at law .
don't try to get up .
i specialize in accident cases .
we're both fine .
i know what i'm doing , i know what i'm doing .
you wouldn't happen to have any french fries on you , would you?
all right , all right .
step back , step back .
i've got injured clients here .
sir , you have caused grievous harm to my clients and their vehicle .
and through your negligence , this child has suffered severe neck injuries .
leave me alone .
stick with me , kid , and you can afford enough nintendo software to sink a battleship .
i can sue my parents?
i sued mine .
my neck !
corruptible youth .
god bless them .
my lord , madam .
you shouldn't be walking in your condition .
this woman is with child .
if any harm came to this infant , by god , sir , you will feel my wrath in court .
what are you talking about?
don't try to weasel out of this .
dozens of witnesses saw your reckless driving .
how many of you saw this man carelessly , and without regard for life and property , careen into my clients at almost 85 miles per hour?
and who of you will tell their story to my young , 24 year old ,
miss lnternational wet t shirt champion , nymphomaniac secretary?
yo !
right here !
right here !
hey , hey !
flakfizer's at it again , i see .
check for outstanding ...
roland t. flakfizer?
that's him .
thank you very much .
you agree with me , i agree with you .
hold that thought .
i swear , i never touched your daughter .
taxi !
here we go .
get in .
get in .
where to?
any place with no extradition laws .
and step on it .
right .
mr. roland t. flakfizer?
that depends .
do i owe you money?
no .
in a drunken stupor , did i promise to marry you?
no .
then i'm your man .
lillian oglethorpe wants to see you .
the lillian oglethorpe?
in her mid 50s , with possible gusts up to 60 , 65?
yes .
can you come right away?
is she still rich?
by all means .
the oglethorpe place .
big bucks .
yeah , you settle back , i'll get you there safe and sound .
one way street .
don't worry , this happens a lot .
you enjoy driving a cab?
no .
as soon as i get me driver's license , i'm quitting .
a guy's really gotta haul rump to make ends meet these days .
i mean , apart from the cab , i'm a pool man , i perform liposuction ,
i got me own toupee business .
something that size should have hair on it .
aren't those numbers clicking by awfully fast?
you're probably a speed reader .
well , you got me there .
another two miles and we own this cab .
i hope you brought money .
oh , sure .
i have a wallet just like that .
hey , that is my wallet .
when i get some money , this could come in handy .
such behavior .
stealing another man's wallet .
you should be ashamed of yourself .
i don't believe it .
you !
what are you doing?
do you know who i am?
a psychotic cab driver?
i'm rocco melonchek .
i hope you know you're blowing any possible tip .
you were my attorney in my divorce case ... ... until you started dating my wife during the trial .
and you got the court to double the alimony request she originally made .
you didn't want her to keep seeing me in cheap motels , did you?
for god's sake , man , she was your wife !
help me .
get off .
all right , all right , all right .
five minute break .
all right , break's over .
wait a minute , wait .
you're a businessman .
let's talk business .
fine , and then i'll kill you .
i thought i recognized you .
i've been looking for you for the past three years .
you're lying .
of course i am , but hear me out .
clients are impressed by a law firm with a big staff .
the more employees , the bigger the fees .
so i could use a man like you in my organization .
travel , excitement and a chance for advancement .
of course , you'll start out on the bottom rung .
but work hard and in no time you'll move up to next to the bottom rung .
you got a dental plan?
lose a tooth , you get two free .
what's my job?
you can be my chauffeur .
how much?
two hundred bucks a week .
600 .
300 .
400 .
800 .
900 .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
shouldn't i be in this negotiation somewhere?
350 and not a penny more .
i'll take it .
what happened to 1000?
i allowed for taxes .
i want four weeks in advance .
five weeks .
hold it .
i'm giving you one minute to stop this .
two minutes .
five minutes .
seven minutes .
nine minutes .
i've stepped into my own private hell .
we'd better get going .
the faster we get to lillian , the quicker i can afford your salaries .
for 350 bucks a week , you drive .
lillian , we really can't wait any longer .
i suppose you're right , edmund .
i can't imagine what is keeping roland .
you guys wait here .
hey , you're the boss .
the reading of the last will and testament ... ... of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
roland !
your royal sex machine .
i wouldn't come without bringing you a terribly expensive gift .
i hope you like it .
it reminds me of you .
roland , how thoughtful of you .
but i believe i have one just like it .
oh , no problem .
i'll take it back and get the money .
mrs. oglethorpe , you look wonderful .
i could make love to you right here and now .
roland , please .
let's keep this on a professional level .
very well , then .
i'll charge you 50 bucks a pop .
mr. oglethorpe !
how well i remember him .
gone now , but not forgotten .
i was never crazy about his taste in clothes .
i hope this speech doesn't seem like a rambling affair , which is something i'm sure we'll be involved in .
oh , lillian , you make me feel just like a natural woman .
i've heard enough .
sir , i am appalled .
lillian , who is this man?
roland , this is mr. edmund lazlo .
a likely story .
just look at him .
he's obviously after your money and social standing , but i was here first .
hey , how is everyone?
have you got any mustard in here?
hey , i'm the boss , remember?
i told you to wait outside .
today's my day off .
excuse me .
and just who are you?
he's a member of my staff .
lillian oglethorpe , rocco melonchek .
rocco melonchek , lillian oglethorpe .
in order to tell you two apart , one of you will have to wear a mustache .
nice to meet someone else who buys their clothes at big and tall man shops .
i beg your pardon?
why?
you can't help it .
refreshments .
good idea , jacques .
he was so devoted to my husband .
darling oscar is dead now , you know .
well , i hope so .
i understand they buried him .
just make yourself feel at home .
lillian ,
i really do believe we should begin .
oh , yes , yes , certainly .
will you all please find yourselves a seat?
oh , i beg your ...
the last will and testament of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
do you have a bathroom?
i protest !
this is most irregular !
lillian ...
edmund !
please be careful .
this man is in obviously no condition to carry on .
rocco , will you continue?
lillian , i ...
right , let's cut to the payoff here .
blah , blah , blah ...
minnesota holdings , ski boat , ski boat , ski boat ...
yacht ...
to my gay lover , i leave
it was a joke .
i was just joking .
yes .
now .
yes , here we are .
all my worldly goods to be transferred into the care of my wife , lillian .
darling .
" and because of my love for the arts , i request that half my fortune be used to establish a ballet company .
excellent .
wonderful .
nothing like the thrill of spending an evening watching a bunch of anorexics leaping around , guys with bulging genitals ...
i hope i'm not arousing you .
this is all very well and good , but i wouldn't know the first thing
about running such a company .
mrs. oglethorpe ...
... as your trusted lawyer ...
you can use those words together? ... and friend ... ... i naturally assumed that task would fall to me .
why would anyone wanna be the head of a ballet company?
and the director of the company shall receive $500, 000 a year salary .
i'll take the job .
i have ballet running through my veins .
lillian , i'm your man !
outrageous !
i doubt whether he knows the difference between the first , second , third , fourth or fifth positions !
hey , he is strictly missionary position .
i will not allow a rogue like you to handle the oglethorpe ballet .
this document should be treated with the dignity and respect it deserves .
hello !
this is no time for family pictures .
charity work .
i gather these for those less fortunate than ourselves who can't afford pornography .
edmund !
i demand this man be dismissed immediately !
jacques , you're working for me now .
for what reason?
does it make you angry?
yes !
that's a good enough reason for me .
lillian , i have a dream .
we'll bring in a whole new breed of ballet goers with innovative giveaways .
leotard nights , wet tutu competitions .
and we'll be the first company performing ballet for the hard of hearing .
we'll have the ballerinas wear wooden shoes .
mrs. oglethorpe , this man doesn't know what he's talking about .
now , leave this matter to me and i will sign for you the world's premier dancer , the great volare .
volare?
how wonderful .
wait a second !
uno pari mutuel .
not the volare !
you know the great volare?
i knew him back when he was known as the pretty good volare .
we served in the army together .
he owes me one .
i threw myself on top of an 1 8 year old vietnamese girl and saved his life .
nonsense !
that's where you're wrong .
this is nonsense .
lillian , i am the only one who can bring you the world's greatest male ballerina .
for myself , i ask only a nominal salary , plus a cut of gross receipts , a bonus of 25 percent on anything above break even , a $300 per diem , the use of a company car and housing .
by all means , make my husband's dream come true .
what , you want him to marry a cheerleader?
give us a ballet .
oh , this is so exciting .
i can see i am no longer required as the family lawyer .
look , i'm thinking of becoming a lawyer .
can i buy your diploma off you?
good heavens .
i need you both .
very well , lillian .
as you wish .
for now .
then this evening i'm off to the ballet .
i must shave , shower , get new clothes and practice signing your name .
my pearl ...
i bid you all a fondue .
if you should lose this hand in an industrial accident , keep it for me .
gentlemen !
alan .
i brought this for you .
it's not exactly a bouquet , but it's a start .
so sweet .
were you watching the ballet again tonight?
of course .
i love to watch you dance .
someday we're gonna be on that stage dancing together .
at the rate i'm going , i'm not so sure .
alan , don't talk that way .
we agreed that if one of us got into a major company , it could only help the both of us .
tonight i'm going to talk to volare about you .
i would love that .
i mean , no one dances like the great volare .
except you .
catch .
tickets , please?
no smoking in the theater .
thank you .
my pleasure .
please .
five and six .
eleven .
25 and 67 .
miss !
these seats are dreadful .
they're facing the stage .
hey , did we miss the coming attractions?
who's the bad guy?
is tom cruise in this?
do you work out?
i'm looking for the great volare .
he's on stage .
and he doesn't appreciate visitors backstage .
no , no , no , i'm not a visitor .
this is strictly business .
this creep bothering you?
no .
no .
she's quite delightful , thank you .
ok , i give up .
how come he doesn't throw up?
bravo , mr. volare .
they love you .
that audience wouldn't know a ballet from a bullfight .
and who are you to speak to me?
where is my towel?
when i come off stage , i expect my towel immediately .
do you understand me?
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
fire him .
tina , darling , you were marvelous .
perhaps we should meet in my dressing room after the performance and discuss your career .
i'd like that very much , mr. volare .
thank you .
lisa !
darling , i thought we'd have dinner tonight after the closing night party .
oh , well , thank you , but i'm afraid i've already made plans .
mr. volare , i'd like you to meet my friend alan grant .
it's a privilege to meet you , mr. volare .
i'm a huge fan of yours .
well , alan's a dancer too , with the performing artists group , the nonprofit ballet troupe .
really?
how sweet .
it's a fine idea to keep busy until one is good enough to command a salary .
my cue .
she looked 1 8 , officer , i swear !
too noisy around here .
i'll say .
i got twice the sleep at a julio lglesias concert .
this guy's gotta get off stage soon .
let's go back , wait for him , sign him up .
excuse us .
excuse me .
we have to get this plutonium back to the lab .
jacques .
hey .
you know him?
sure .
he used to drive mr. oglethorpe to the theater ,
then i'd sneak him into the ballet .
i'm gonna be the best man
at their wedding .
i hope so .
excuse me , we didn't get your name .
oh , my name's rocco melonchek .
i'm the ballet world's up and coming manager/ agent .
i'm here to sign a contract with the great volare .
i hate to burst your bubble , but volare already has an agent and manager .
that's too bad .
any of them real sick?
you don't need volare .
what you need is the next great ballet talent .
a young , fresh face .
alan grant .
exactly .
i got it right .
there's my cue .
jacques , convince mr. melonchek alan's the person he's looking for .
this is all well and good , but can he dance?
could he make millions?
would he sign a contract for a lot of money , but take scale ,
ieaving his manager with everything else?
sure he would .
wouldn't you , alan?
alan?
can't you see he's watching the woman he adores?
you're in love with her , aren't you?
you bet .
when's the wedding?
there won't be one ... ... unless i can find a job dancing .
to tell you the truth , mr. melonchek , i'm about out of money and i'm gonna have to go back to minneapolis .
i'll tell you what .
don't you buy that plane ticket just yet , because i am gonna get you an audition with roland t. flakfizer , ballet director .
you could do that?
sure .
they're like this .
well , let's go to work , mr. melonchek .
i now pronounce us dancer and manager .
yeah !
come in .
tina , darling .
i'm so glad you've come .
you were most inspiring tonight .
i can see that under my guidance , your career will soar .
already i can hear the audience roar .
who are you?
roland t. flakfizer , managing director of the oglethorpe flakfizer ballet company .
you wouldn't happen to have a plunger on you , would you?
i beg your pardon?
oh , i see you have a pretty visitor .
i'll tell you what .
i'll get a girl and we'll double .
you got five minutes , mr. volare .
five minutes?
my god !
have you consulted another doctor?
you are out of line .
and you are out of toilet paper .
but we're still short one girl .
what are you doing here?
to sign you for my ballet company .
to sign me for your ballet company?
swear to god , i just said that .
why don't you run along and let us men talk business .
just leave your phone number and favorite color with the manager and later we'll talk business .
you're cute , mr ...?
garvey .
steve garvey .
i think we have something beautiful , you and l .
someday you'll have my children .
in fact , they're out in the car , if you want them .
oh , god ...
you're still here?
i will have you thrown out of the theater .
first , we talk ballet .
i know nothing of your ballet .
we have a lot in common .
i'm managing director and i don't either .
look , i don't dance for just anyone .
i am ballet .
my dance shoes are in the louvre in paris .
so what?
last year , i left a raincoat in cleveland .
do you realize what i was doing at the age of 7?
i can imagine .
you must be thankful you didn't go blind .
i was dancing professionally .
well , whatever you call it : flogging the carrot , polishing the cue stick , choking the chicken , clearing the snorkel ...
but i didn't come back here to rehash good times .
volare , dance with the oglethorpe flakfizer ballet company and you can name your price .
money is no object .
it isn't mine .
look , i'm offering you a check for $500, 000 .
it's made out to volare , great , the .
i don't dance for the money .
then you dance and i'll keep the money .
look , i will not dance for your ballet and that is final .
a flakfizer doesn't know the meaning of the word " no .
and we're a little fuzzy on the word " panagglutinin " and " viscosity .
all right , all right .
let's sweeten the pot .
the same money ,
we throw in a girl .
no !
then would you object to me getting one?
i'm a lonely man , mr. volare .
i will give you till the count of ten to get out of here .
one , two , three  before you get stuck somewhere around six , i'll go .
if there's anything i can ever do for you , forget it .
because i don't do those kind of things .
and for the last time , i warn you about that highly contagious rash .
i beg you to see to it at once .
hygiene , mr. volare .
hygiene .
mr. flakfizer .
where? !
i'm sorry , i thought my father showed up .
come here , come here .
did volare accept your offer?
i didn't know the meaning of the word " no , " but he had it down pretty good .
you wouldn't happen to have a world famous dancer stuffed in a drawer somewhere , would you?
as a matter of fact , i would .
his name's alan grant .
he can dance rings around volare .
he's even more talented than gorbachev .
gesundheit .
baryshnikov .
god bless you .
baryshnikov .
hi .
how's it going?
how you doing?
you look very nice today .
he's one of the best dancers in the country .
hire him for the ballet .
what do you say?
no , no , nay , nyet .
i have to find some way to sign volare .
when i do that , i'm director of the ballet .
and , gentlemen , that spells cash with a capital ...
k.
you should go back to school .
i hated teaching .
flakfizer , i thought you were smart .
i am smart .
i said no to you , didn't l?
i'm offering you two incomes .
your paycheck from the ballet company and then when you sign alan grant to dance , another hefty check as part of alan's management team .
how do we get this past mrs. oglethorpe?
relax .
after she sees alan dance , you've got nothing to worry about .
except for taxes , depletion of the ozone layer and diseases due to any sexual contact .
that's a load off my mind .
all you gotta do is convince mrs. oglethorpe to let alan into the charity bazaar .
are you kidding?
i can charm the pants off of her .
now , that is a disgusting thought .
gentlemen , you're gonna have to sneak him in .
not so fast .
you know , i worry about you , i really do .
we're gonna make this legal .
we need a contract .
a binding document , with plenty of loopholes .
exactly .
jacques , draw up the standard contract , would you , please?
hello , jacques .
we've got years to go before we even come close to the japanese .
right .
sign that .
this paper's blank .
i'll fill it in later .
fair enough .
you're not gonna cheat me or anything?
i give you my word as a gentleman .
well , you had me until then .
all right , all right .
fifty fifty split .
now , this is more like it .
what about me?
to show you no favoritism , rocco and i
will also split your salary fifty fifty .
thanks .
that should keep you out of a higher income bracket .
come to think of it , that should keep you out of any income bracket .
rocco , jacques , tomorrow , alan grant joins the oglethorpe ballet company .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... welcome to the ninth annual oglethorpe charity festival .
let's go .
it gives me great pleasure to announce the oglethorpe ballet company will be leaving for new york tomorrow , where we ...
you two go and get dressed .
be ready in ten minutes .
t en minutes?
we'll be ready .
and you're gonna be a star .
you know , if you keep this up , i may even start to believe it .
nice to have a chance to make someone's wish come true .
that's a nice thing to do .
well , how did the market close?
well , roll over my amalgamated , split my utilities and double my capital venture overlays .
now , call me in an hour and tell me what the hell i'm talking about .
pull over .
everybody all set?
we've got everything so under control , it's pathetic .
and so is he .
good .
driver , drive on .
look out for that truck !
buffy ...
lillian .
get this thing up on the rack and have it overhauled .
better yet , why don't you get up on the rack and i'll see you in an hour .
avanti !
here , buffy .
there you are .
darling .
have you come to see mommy?
what a charming little animal .
do you know dogs , mr. melonchek?
know dogs?
i used to be a chef in a korean restaurant .
good food , good friends , good conversation .
roland , i'm so upset volare turned us down .
i know .
what a slap in our collective faces .
like i told you , he has no respect for our ballet .
i wouldn't want a man like that dancing for me .
or with me , for that matter .
i offered him half the moon .
i keep asking myself , " why didn't he sign with us?
because he said he wouldn't work with you if you were the last person on earth .
what was that?
nothing .
fetch .
my darling lillian , volare has shunned us .
hold your chins up high , for i have discovered a fabulous young dancer .
a talent that soars .
volare .
it's volare !
oh , good heavens .
it's him .
it's volare .
step back .
step back .
step back .
lillian , permit me to introduce
the great volare .
i've seen greater .
signorvolare , i understand you've refused to dance with our company .
the truth of the matter is mr. volare won't work with mr. flakfizer .
but , my dear lillian , i am happy to announce that i have signed mr. volare to dance with and to be the artistic director of the oglethorpe ballet company .
ladies and gentlemen , the overture has started .
overture to what?
the ballet find of the century .
what?
roll up !
roll up !
top class ballet , this way !
lillian , just a little surprise i cooked up .
if you don't like it , it was rocco's idea .
oh , roland , i love a surprise .
yeah !
yo , rocco , rocco .
mrs. oglethorpe , meet the future world champion of ballet ,
mr. alan grant .
it's a pleasure .
nice to meet you .
mrs. oglethorpe , i would like to make an announcement .
he's being deported .
i have found my prima ballerina ...
... the lovely miss lisa le baron .
what?
well ...
but what about alan?
shall we say , a most unusual technique .
perhaps better suited to experimental theater .
you can't talk to my client like that .
if alan isn't in the company , i won't be either .
neither will l .
that's a victory for all mankind .
you're making a mistake , my dear .
lisa , i agree with volare .
but , alan , we'll be apart for months .
remember when you told me that with you dancing ,
it would be good for both of us?
yes , but
when volare makes you a star , you can choose anyone to dance with .
dance with the oglethorpe .
come on .
i'll be the proudest guy in the country .
all right .
you've made a wise choice , my dear .
then it's settled .
i am so excited .
you're excited?
feel these nipples .
now , lillian , about the directorship of the ballet company ...
oh , yes .
yes , of course , edmund .
you have brought us the great volare .
and dear roland has presented us with our ballerina .
i think it only fair that you and roland share the honor .
flakfizer?
this is preposterous .
preposterous , is it?
why don't we step outside
and settle this like men .
we are outside .
then why don't we step inside and settle this like women .
or are you afraid , lazlo?
i'm twice the man you are .
so is she .
and it's driving me mad .
oh , lillian , can't you see i'm on fire?
and you , you contemptible cur !
maybe you don't want to work for mrs. oglethorpe .
is that so , edmund?
of course not !
i will do anything that is best for the ballet .
well , there's no need to commit suicide .
and to show you no hard feelings , how about a cigar .
i don't smoke .
well , i do .
why don't you run out and get me one .
and now , since i'm in charge of the ballet , just jamming that thought home , i propose a toast .
champagne !
i'm not going to work with such an uncouth pig .
certainly , mr. volare .
now it's on to new york !
and a hefty per diem .
good morning .
good morning .
here you go .
here you go .
i'm all out of american currency .
take a fistful of romanian 50s , all right?
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
the end of another grueling day .
the press conference is to begin in five minutes .
roland seems to be running a little late .
late?
that charlatan hasn't been around in weeks .
i don't know why you put up with him .
he's never in his office .
he never responds to his calls .
he's totally irresponsible .
lisa .
relax , my dear .
everyone is nervous their first time .
just follow my lead .
i'm very experienced .
that's very kind of you , mr. volare .
oh , come on .
call me roberto .
roberto .
lisa , i know an intimate little bistro with a fabulous view of the city .
perhaps dinner and an all night boat ride?
well , i don't really think that would be such a good idea
i hope i'm interrupting something .
volare , you know it's not polite to drool in public .
roland , i haven't seen you for weeks .
lillian , my pile of sweetness .
i'm so sorry .
i've been busy promoting our ballet at beauty pageants .
and then , of course , there's my volunteer work at the breast implant clinic .
and how i missed you .
in fact , i missed you so much , two days ago i went out and i bought a woman who looks just like you .
oh , you silly .
for you .
from you .
another lovely bracelet .
i didn't want this wrist to think i was neglecting it .
oh , roland ...
lillian , l
lazlo , i didn't see you there .
i stand corrected .
i saw you , but i chose to ignore you .
lisa , my darling .
will you excuse us?
two's company and three's an adult movie .
mrs. oglethorpe , may we start?
oh , please .
is she a fox or what?
ladies and gentlemen , for many weeks now the oglethorpe ballet company have been in rehearsal .
tomorrow we open with roberto volare's interpretation of tears of the swan .
at this time , i wish to introduce to you the creative genius behind our company , the brightest light in the ballet firmament ...
thank you for those kind words , edmund lazlo .
i don't know who does your hair , but tell me , where do they do it and when are they bringing it back?
well , i had a speech all prepared , but today i'm going to speak from the heart .
you've no doubt asked yourself , " why has he been chosen for this task of running the oglethorpe?
a man's man .
but i like women a lot more .
my intimate views of jackie , cher , sean , larry , moe , curly .
over 200 pages of provocative pictures , and only one page has any writing on it .
act now and you can get one of these fabulous " flakfizer is ballet " t shirts .
mastercard and visas accepted .
that brings me to the task at hand , to introduce the woman i adore .
behind every great man is a woman .
and thank heaven i have lillian oglethorpe , because , quite frankly ,
i enjoy the shade .
dear lillian , soon i hope to take you on a caribbean cruise , where we can hold hands on a soft summer's evening and watch that old jamaican moon .
why that old jamaican will be mooning us , i have no idea .
and now , here she is , the woman voted by her senior class
most likely to go up a few dress sizes , " a woman who would be a man , except her name is lillian ,
lillian oglethorpe .
thank you .
thank you .
hey .
hey , what's with all the tears?
this should be the happiest night of your life .
i know it should be .
it's just that ... ... i miss alan so much .
well , i'd feel the same way if the man i loved was thousands of miles away .
of course , i'd be living a whole different lifestyle .
here , come with me .
i know just the thing to cheer you up .
if you just step right in here , my dear , your spirits might just brighten .
but that's mr. volare's dressing room .
of course .
he's got the best champagne .
alan !
lisa .
flakfizer flew alan out to see you in the opening of the ballet .
it's a formal affair .
do you have tuxedos?
i got mine .
that's great for tomorrow , but aren't you a little overdressed for today?
oh , no .
i'm very impressed .
i don't have any luggage .
then this all makes sense .
i was worried there for a second .
mr. flakfizer , thank you .
i see you're saving your best stuff for alan .
i think we should leave the lovers alone for a few minutes .
make that a few hours .
i missed you so much .
i don't want us to be apart ever again .
i told you before !
oh , my god , it's volare .
you better hide .
don't hang my tight by the crotch !
it throws off my bulge !
yes , volare , i'm sorry .
lisa , what a pleasant surprise .
i see you decided to start our little party early , huh?
roberto , you've got the wrong idea .
oh , no .
i think i've got the right idea .
roberto , stop it !
get your hands off of her !
you !
what are you doing here?
mr. flakfizer flew me out .
you and mr. flakfizer are going to be sorry for this .
volare , what happened?
it's flakfizer .
he's brought that performance artist out here .
hasn't that information arrived yet?
no , but we may not need it .
i have devised a little plan .
he's staying at lillian's townhouse .
all we have to do is make a few arrangements .
oh , no .
lillian?
well , no one's in .
roland .
this is just a business call .
i didn't think you were back so soon .
roland .
lillian ... ... can't we just be friends?
why , you're not lillian .
you gonna spank me?
we can start there ... ... and see what happens .
are we alone?
servants have the day off .
lillian is already at the theater , but i'm here .
take me .
okay .
let's say two out of three falls .
no standing eight count .
wait .
i wanna make love by candlelight .
i could do you one better .
i think this is more in keeping with ... things to come .
not a bad little pad lillian's got here .
was that the doorbell?
that wasn't you?
never mind .
just ignore it .
well , it's a big house .
maybe they can't hear the bell .
let's try this .
wait a minute .
i'll be right back .
if you need anything , there's plenty of batteries in my room .
oh , let me try this .
good idea .
you go through the window .
if the alarm goes off , i'll run away so they won't catch both of us .
we don't want any !
oh , it's you .
we have to talk .
it's very important .
look .
the next half hour , give or take 29 minutes , will be very important for me , so thanks for dropping by .
yeah , but
flakfizer !
the face is familiar .
it's mine .
and so it is .
say , if you ever visit this planet again , give me a call .
we'll have lunch .
flakfizer .
how come you didn't knock?
i'm using a better grade of gas .
that's not bad , is it?
you know , i always enjoy it when we get together , but i want you out , or i'll be forced to kill you .
i'll tell the police
i did it out of love .
flakie , aren't you coming to bed?
that's a girl .
not just a girl , a way of life .
what if mrs. oglethorpe comes back?
she'll have to wait her turn .
i saw tina first .
don't you see?
lazlo wants mrs. oglethorpe to catch you in bed with her !
oh , no !
mrs. oglethorpe !
i've been in situations like this before .
we act calm .
stay cool .
okay , okay .
tina leaves by the back door and no one is any the wiser .
it's an old gary hart trick .
i'm not leaving till i'm satisfied .
you beast !
really has a such a nice light touch with women .
you big brute !
how dare you ...
get her out of sight !
no , no , no !
that's lillian's room .
in here .
in here .
not there !
she can't be found there .
that's my room .
i don't know why you insist on returning to my home .
we can't miss the final dress rehearsal of the ballet .
lillian , my dear , we can't go without flakfizer .
i just thought it would make for a better appearance if we all arrive at the same time .
you have been looking at your watch all morning , edmund .
your behavior is most peculiar .
you big animal !
what was that?
we must investigate !
edmund , what is this?
you relentless sex stallion .
oh , great .
now she's talking about me .
what was that?
jacques , show her what will happen if she doesn't shut up .
that came from your suite .
hide her !
my bedroom?
ninety eight , 99 , 100 .
lillian , lazlo .
my two favorite l's .
what on earth are you doing here at this ungodly hour?
i know you're up to something , flakfizer .
a snap inspection?
roland .
what are you doing in my bedroom?
this is your room?
thank god .
i thought someone sewed up all my fly holes .
lazlo , how about the three of us going down to the kitchen
and making a big sandwich .
i hardly think so .
i'm going to check under the bed .
edmund !
what on earth has gotten into you?
be more careful .
you did that on purpose .
you're trying to conceal the fact that
your suite .
and i think you're pretty terrific yourself .
you stay here .
there's no telling what he may do in this crazed state !
lazlo .
i say , lazlo .
what are you looking for?
a woman .
how about calling an escort service?
i'm calling the police .
excuse me .
i'm so sorry .
forgive me .
i'm sorry .
the guest bedrooms .
roland .
all right .
get in .
get in .
roland , what is all the commotion?
it's lazlo .
i've never seen him like this .
quick , in here .
and while you're in there , why don't you make the bed .
i know she's here somewhere .
lazlo !
what?
what was that?
i don't know , but it came from in here .
edmund , this is outrageous .
i can explain .
he's got a woman tied up .
edmund !
she looks dazed and drugged .
no .
he's obviously the grand dragon of some sex slave cult .
and she looks like she's about 1 5 .
no , no , no .
okay , 1 4 , then .
in fact , i know she's 1 4 because i was dating her a year ago .
edmund , i want you out of my house this instant .
if i had to take a wild guess , i'd say you're out of a job .
i hope there's no hard feelings .
you know , lazlo , this is a good look for you .
flakfizer .
lazlo , are you decent?
lillian .
quick , smelling salts !
and a crane , if you got one .
oh , my goodness .
you've done it now , lazlo .
i don't feel a thing .
this woman is dead .
you're holding his wrist .
then this man is dead .
mrs. oglethorpe is unconscious .
smelling salts , right away .
hello , excuse me , gentlemen?
triple speed messenger service .
i got a message here for a guy named lazlo .
give me that .
this is a litany of fraudulent accident cases , bad debts and several police departments who would love to get their hands on you .
and when mrs. oglethorpe comes to , she will read this and she will have no course but to fire you !
quick , try some chloroform .
i'm taking lillian to the hospital .
you , help me get her to the car .
why don't you take him along for a brain scan .
gently .
easy .
what are we gonna do now?
what any flakfizer would do .
what , something devious and underhanded?
you know the family .
if we don't get that letter before lillian wakes up , we're dead ducks .
multiple fractures?
lucky day .
the name's flakfizer .
no job too small , no fee too large .
if any limb falls off , mail it to me .
it can only strengthen our case .
roland t. flakfizer .
this is your lucky day .
this man's dead .
then he won't be needing this .
i'm almost all out of business cards .
excuse me .
what are you gentlemen doing here?
we're here to see mrs. lillian oglethorpe .
i'm afraid that's not possible .
she's on a private floor .
hospital personnel and doctors only .
hi .
ed breckerman , security .
there's a mercedes on fire in the doctors 'parking lot .
when will mrs. oglethorpe regain consciousness?
she's under a sedative .
you'll have to ask the doctor .
you called?
at last .
no letter here .
right , i'll carve .
dark meat or white?
now , this is a very important woman .
i hope you know your business .
hey , so do we .
i wanna assure you we've been doctors
for many , many floors now .
you're not the doctor i saw earlier .
he caught what she got .
we're filling in .
she's been out since she came here?
yes .
and so she hasn't been able
to read anything , then , huh?
of course not .
good .
it will bring on complications .
not for her , necessarily ,
but complications nonetheless .
she's coming to , doctor .
now we got complications .
she's going out , doctor .
the crisis is over .
this is ludicrous .
i don't think anyone will argue that point .
let the games begin .
it's the first annual vasectomy bowl .
what is going on?
a happy doctor is a good doctor .
what is the meaning of this?
are you sure you're a doctor?
that's gotta hurt .
at least , i hope it does .
doctor , we'll have to run a few tests .
table for one .
there you go .
ground transportation , courtesy of medicare .
you say ether and i say either ether , either
oh , please proceed .
i'm just checking on mrs. oglethorpe .
well , doctor?
yes , doctor?
yes , doctor?
doctor .
doctor .
yes .
well , i thought we'll have to perform a full " rectumology .
an epidemic .
drop those pants .
not you , the patient .
i thought you were cardiologists .
they're all connected .
we enter the rectum and head north .
why do you think we have such long instruments?
x rays for dr. blazie .
i'll take those .
i deal in x rays .
i see you do too .
i used to work at las vegas general .
security to room 1 404 .
yeah .
hit me .
i'll play these .
read them and weep .
three hearts .
beats a pair of kidneys .
doctor , your diagnosis?
difficult to tell from the negative .
it's her liver .
looks more like veal to me .
what is this?
an obstruction in the fourth lumbar .
huge backup in the lower intestine .
my advice is to avoid the intestine and plan an alternate route .
grab a left at the first major artery and get on the fifth lumbar heading south .
skeletal update every hour on the hour .
time for a thorough checkup .
it's gotta be here somewhere .
the operation is a success !
success .
success .
doctors , we're done here .
arrest those men .
come here .
come on , man .
what are you doing?
come on .
come here .
stay still , all right?
so you were the doctors .
no , we're not them .
we're someone else .
the three you're looking for are our twin brothers .
you'll never see us together , because we love the same women .
that's next on geraldo .
roland .
yes?
what are you doing here?
that's a good question .
what am i doing here?
lmpersonating a doctor , harassing a patient , altering medical records .
trespassing , destroying hospital property .
and don't forget alan punching out volare .
whose side are you on anyway?
give me that .
stealing private property .
it could happen to anyone .
society's to blame .
too much violence in the movies .
it's my environment .
we were carrying out orders !
it's the japanese .
they're buying up everything .
did we leave anything out?
could i have a personalized number?
is my hair okay?
empty your pockets .
you can make one call .
hello , sportsline?
steamer , hi .
this is rocco .
am i on the air?
give me that .
be careful with that .
do you know who this man is?
this is jackson pollock jr . , son of roy lichtenstein .
in a few years , this could be worth millions .
nobody knows the trouble i've seen
nobody knows my sorrow
what's it all about , alfie?
is it just for the moment we live?
what's it all about when you sort it out , alfie?
in the jungle , the mighty jungle , the lion sleeps tonight
in the jungle , the quiet jungle , the lion sleeps tonight
hey .
you got visitors .
maybe it's somebody
with a recording contract .
alan .
lisa .
you can go home , fellas .
you bribed a guard?
i paid your bail .
how did you do that?
i used my severance pay .
you have servants?
no .
volare fired me .
it seems i wasn't appreciative enough .
he can't do that .
no , he's done it , all right .
and now he's dancing with lisa's understudy .
the one with the large chest?
there's nobody in the company like that .
would be if i were running things .
this is terrible .
and volare's vowed to blackball us from ever dancing for a major ballet company .
that's not fair .
i know .
and it's all my fault .
oh , it's your fault , huh?
alan , don't talk that way .
why , i wouldn't dance with volare if he were the last man on earth .
wait a minute .
just because you're not in the ballet doesn't mean you won't dance tonight .
flakfizer's right .
i don't know why , but he's right .
and i think it's about time for alan to make his new york debut .
to the theater , and not a minute to lose !
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
tina , darling .
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
five minutes , mr. volare .
five minutes?
oh , my god .
what have i been doing?
four minutes , mr. volare .
four minutes?
three minutes , mr. jolson .
what's going on here?
where do you want these , mr. volare?
anywhere .
just keep them out of my way .
all right .
come on .
hurry up .
get out of here .
go .
hey , you too .
you too .
out .
where do you want these , mr. volare?
what's going on here? !
how do i know?
have you lost your mind?
lobstergram for mr. volare .
lobstergram !
oh , there you are .
for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow
a masseuse !
lazlo !
mr. volare is coming .
places , please .
t onight is your night , my dear .
thanks to you , edmund .
after the performance ,
i will announce you as the sole director of our ballet company .
if i do say so myself , the ballet is in good hands .
how could i ever have trusted someone as nefarious as roland flakfizer?
i don't wish to hear his name mentioned ever again .
edmund .
it's those idiots !
i will put a stop to this .
good evening , ballet fans .
we've got a good one .
another big league ballet battle starring that plucky roberto " bulldog " volare .
and what a great night for a ballet it is .
the sky is clear , the wind is blowing from left to right , which means the ballerinas should be flying out of here .
and here we go .
volare does a pirouette , another pirouette .
a skip , a leap .
he spins .
he scores !
listen to that crowd !
it's him !
we return you now to your regularly scheduled program .
come here .
get the police now !
hi .
get out !
get ...
hold it .
the great volare?
bon voyage .
no !
all right , yeah .
okay .
here we go .
slam dunk .
yes !
this is an outrage !
i will not continue unless you put a stop to this !
yes , sir .
spread out .
find them !
let's go .
don't hey , give me that .
get out of here .
get out .
damn .
get off .
off .
let's go , this way .
this way .
ole !
what on earth is happening?
edmund .
anyone?
you rang?
roland , what is happening?
ballet history .
when do we go on?
i'd say right about now .
there they are !
arrest those men !
don't let them get away !
oh , boy .
i will never work for the oglethorpe ballet again !
will you put that in writing?
this evening could ruin my career !
at least we're thinking along the same lines .
i must explain to my public this is all your doing .
they're trying to tell you something .
i quit !
that's what they're trying to tell you .
officers , take these people away .
oh , my god , he's got a gun !
the man's insane .
he could use a gift certificate to the betty ford center .
we'll have lunch right after the lobotomy .
always remember , nobody likes you .
bravo !
bravo !
wonderful .
wonderful !
we're a hit !
go on , get back out there .
get back out there .
listen to that crowd !
you're a ballet legend .
and you're not even dead yet .
oh , roland , i'm so glad i trusted you .
rest assured , my darling , i will never leave your side again .
what's that?
nothing .
hey , what happened?
i got an idea .
hey , big boy .
come here .
yes .
oh , boy .
