my name is melinda gordon .
i just got married , just moved to a small town , just opened up an antiques shop .
i might be just like you ... except from the time that i was a little girl ,
i knew that i could talk to the dead .
it's all right, honey .
earthbound spirits , " my grandmother called them , the ones who have not crossed over yet because they have unfinished business with the living , and they come to me for help .
to tell you my story ,
i have to tell you theirs .
i'm so sorry .
what are you doing?
i just can't do this anymore .
no .
no !
stop !
don't !
you guys, honestly, it's getting so old .
i'm serious .
gwen, please !
gwen, please ! think about what are you doing .
part like throuth, gwen please ,
gwen stop it !
don't ! this isn't right
please stop it !
i swear i could hear someone yelling up there .
i'm telling you, sometimes i think the walls in thisbuilding are made of tracing paper .
ooh !
we gotta get up there .
she lives alone .
i haven't seen her all day .
hello?
can you hear me?
hello !
break it down .
break it down .
oh, my god !
she took pills .
what kind?
a lot of aticar, proxytin, others, i think .
jim, she took pills aticar, proxytin, maybe more .
call 9 1 1 .
ok, ok .
ma'am?
ma'am?
hi .
i have a woman , and she's unconscious .
259 west main street .
i'm not getting a pulse .
tell them that .
he says she doesn't have a pulse .
he's doing cpr .
i'm losin 'her .
no .
gwen, not like this .
it isn't right .
i just wanted to be with you .
take me with you .
you can see me !
not, no . go away .
i'm looking for my doctor .
where is he?
i'm sure he's here .
go away .
tall .
you know what?
it's really not a good time .
hey, we got her stabilized .
she should be all right .
what's gonna happen to her?
well, all they can do is hold her for a few days .
the hospital psych team will evaluate her .
if they feel like she's not a threat to herself of anybody else they gotta let her go .
let's get out of here .
you know what?
why don't you guys go ahead, and i'll catch up .
all right .
how come you're the only one who can see me?
i've been asking myself that question for years .
who are you?
i'm conor donovan .
um ... i'm her fiance .
you mean were her fiance .
semantics .
has she tried this before?
no .
well, she's been depressed since ... since i left .
can i ask how .. how i left?
it was, um, a year ago .
my third triathlon .
i was kicking ass a 2 1/ 2 mile swim, a 112 mile bike .
i was just getting ready to start the 26 mile run .
i was heading for my best time ever .
nothing was gonna stop me .
nothing ...
except a little kid on a speedster 8500 .
i remember thinking how much i envied that kid .
my father gave me that same bike when i was about his age , and i just wanted to talk to him all about it, you know?
i wanted to ride that bike again so bad , but then, just like that , no more conor donovan .
i'm sorry .
i didn't even know what sorry was until i saw gwen get the news .
to see the life just ... go right out of their eyes .
that was a year ago , and you're still here .
why?
look at her .
how can i leave?
she's got no family .
she's all alone .
i have to take care of her .
you can't .
you're not really ... present with her .
semantics again .
there is something else .
what?
we have to move her now, ma'am .
did you stop by the hospital?
on my way in .
she kept asking for you .
i've known her for a year, but she asked for you?
i mean, how could she even know you?
she was unconscious the entire time .
she saw me .
when?
she had an out of body experience before jim brought her back .
oh .
i should have known it was something simple like that .
she also saw her dead fiance .
he's haunting her, just fyi .
that's how you knew about the pills .
he was at the hospital with her, too .
oh .
that is so ... creepy .
wait a minute .
this can't be .
what?
the county tax bill . $15, 000?
small business assessment?
this is like 3 times what i thought it was gonna be .
if this is right, it's gonna totally blow through my savings .
i saw him .
i saw conor ... at the apartment .
i knew he was there all along .
i know .
i saw you, too .
i saw you talking to him .
how did you do that?
tell her i'm here now .
tell her .
i know that this is gonna sound strange, and it's .. not your medication messing with your head .
um ... i can see spirits .
earthbound spirits who haven't crossed over .
you mean like ghosts?
i don't know if they actually told you, but you ... you died, only for a few seconds while my husband was working on you .
he's a paramedic and ... that's when you saw me ... and conor .
you can talk to ghosts?
and hear them?
how?
it's a long story .
is he here now?
yes, baby, i'm right here .
i've always been here .
he's here .
where?
right next to you .
on your left .
conor, you didn't leave me .
no, baby, i told you i'd never leave you .
can he hear me?
can he hear us?
yeah .
i just i wanted to see you so badly .
tell her how much i miss her .
i miss talking to her .
he wants you to know that he misses you .
oh, conor, i miss you, too .
i feel you everywhere . it's like ... my skin hurts and the inside of my bones hurt and it's just .. it's so deep i can't grab ahold of it .
i know, i know .
i can't even touch it . it's like i .. baby, i feel it, too .
tell her i'm furious at her .
don't ever try that again !
he's mad at you for what you did, and he doesn't want you to ever .. no, i won't. i won't.
that's enough for tonight .
don't go .
i won't .
baby, don't worry .
hey, we'll see you soon, ok?
get some rest .
ok .
see what i mean?
she's the ..
she's the same now as she was the day i died .
you said there was one more thing you need to do before you could go . what is it?
it might sound kind of morbid .
hello .
i'm talking to a dead person .
i was an organ donor and ... the day i died, they took my heart .
i need to see who has it .
why?
i'v ... i've ... i've got to see what kind of person is ..
i need to know that they're taking good care of it .
like waxing and cleaning it?
no .
i just want to be sure they you know, that it went to somebody ... worthy .
i'm sorry .
and if you find that person , if you see them, will you ... cross over, move on?
what if i am happy here?
this isn't the place for you anymore .
if gwen gets better , if i feel she is taken care of ... then you'll go?
yes .
we're surrounded by a world of things but it's never enough to give us what we want but if we all stop with our self distraction we'll start a world reaction ... he was the kindest man .
he was always trying to make somebody else's job easier .
we would be at a restaurant and he would brush the crumbs off the table , sweep them into his palm and just hold them until he could throw them out .
and he would grin at me and wink ,
like it was our little secret .
that's the thing about being with conor .
it felt like he was letting you in on this big secret , something just for the two of us .
ask her if she remembers the time we got lost in boston .
he's here .
i knew it .
i thought i felt him touch me .
well, kind of, anyway .
it was like a feather against my arm .
sometimes spirits can let you feel their energy .
it's no more than like a little rush of air .
yeah, right .
i feel that a lot .
does he dim the lights sometimes, too?
they can also use their energy to affect electricity if they try really hard .
how do you know all this?
gwen, the thing that i do ... my job ,
i guess you could say, is to help people get closure , make peace with death , sometimes get important messages across .
but it's all so that people can move on , people who die, people who are left behind .
the idea is to move on .
it's time for him to go .
did i tell you he used to read to me if i couldn't fall asleep?
there will never be anybody else like him, not for me .
i know it seems that way .
no, it is that way .
everything happens for a reason , and that is why conor is still here .
that's fate, and there's nothing that you can do about it .
ok .
i want to talk about boston .
how come a ghost would know where his heart went?
probably because he went straight to gwen when he died .
oh .
i'm not sure it's such a great idea .
why not?
well, maybe a recipient doesn't want to know where his organ came from especially a heart .
and that's a hard enough ordeal to go through .
they're asking you to meet the person who gave you your heart and by the way, that person's dead .
it's been a year .
maybe he's curious .
besides, it's the only way i'm gonna get this guy to cross over so just tell me where to start .
well, if he died at mercy, they've got a helipad , so his organs would have been harvested immediately and choppered right out .
but you are gonna need somebody at the hospital whose willing to bend the rules a little bit .
we never give out that kind of information .
yeah, i know, but the thing is ,
i'm not trying to get you in any trouble .
it's just, the information is for someone very ... are you family?
well, in the family of man sense, i guess .
sorry .
no way .
anything else?
can you at least give me cities and initials?
this isn't jeopardy ! .
bye, now .
aw, damn .
the second generator didn't kick in .
please wait here till the lights come back .
can you help me?
donor's name ... date of death ... and the code r w h o d.
hurry .
ok .
got it .
thank you .
can i do anything for you?
rain check .
everything ok?
you can go now, if that's what you mean?
damn .
anyway, coming these past few weeks ,
listening, watching ... it was my doctor's idea, not mine .
he's always telling me to try we usually begin our talks with the introduction .
oh, yeah .
ok .
my name is cliff aimes , and it's been a year since my surgery .
please tell everyone what kind of surgery .
transplant .
congratulations on your " surgiversary .
yeah, but the thing is ,
i've had a bad heart my whole life .
i always felt like i had one foot in the grave and the other one on a banana peel .
ow . it's a tough room .
i mean, it's not like i'm not grateful for the heart i got .
i am .
i just ...
i feel even more afraid now, like ... maybe i don't even deserve to have it .
maybe someone else should talk .
i really liked what you had to say .
why?
it sounded like the truth .
melinda gordon .
cliff aimes .
don't tell me you're a heart patient .
no .
no, i'm more like a student .
studying what?
the impact on people with things like this .
things like?
transplants .
the emotional impact ... you know, what it's like to get a second chance .
i'm still trying to figure out what went wrong with the first chance .
maybe you could help me .
i don't think so .
i'm just curious .
you may have noticed, i don't excel at talking to groups .
i'm not too good at talking one on one either, so ... it was nice to meet you .
do you ever find yourself thinking about the donor?
why would you ask me that?
i mean, it's a natural thing to ... what else do you want to ask me?
if i get hungry for things i never liked before?
if i smell things so freakin 'familiar
i just can't figure out what they are?
do you?
ask me if i feel guilty because some guy i didn't know is dead and i'm here, talking to you about it .
well, what did you expect?
i expected somebody filled with joy about having a new lease on life .
and you got andy rooney .
hey, how's gwen?
feeling better .
is her fiance still making things go bump in the night?
sometimes i don't know who's holding who back ... but every time i see them together , the only thing that i can think of is how lucky we are ... and what they'd give to have what we have .
let's not ever take that for granted, ok?
deal .
even so, if something ever happened to me and you were alone, i would want you to be happy .
no .
i'd want you to find someone and find love again .
i mean, wouldn't you want the same thing for me if something happened to you?
no .
no? !
you wouldn't want me to be happy?
fine .
sure i would, ok?
make friends, go out and make money, be happy ,
but no other guy .
ok .
out of the question .
how did i snag such a sensitive, modern man?
guess you can just call me lucky .
hey, look at this .
it says that my tax bill was paid in full .
who could have done this?
wow !
i don't know .
maybe somebody you helped or something?
who?
i don't know anybody who has this kind of money and how would they know?
i'm gonna call the tax board and find out .
anyway, i decided that we should get gwen out of her apartment .
right?
i mean, she really needs a girls 'night out .
that's a great idea .
cool .
so saturday night, lento's on the square?
no karaoke?
cross my heart .
i'll be there .
aren't you haunting the wrong girl?
is that him?
hi .
what are you doing here?
um ... take my picture?
you don't meet the height requirement .
excuse me .
i have to develop these .
develop? thought everyone uses digital now .
everyone does .
i don't.
listen, can i talk to you?
digital is electronic .
it's cold .
film is chemical .
it's emotional .
there's no comparison .
did you take these?
you have a wonderful eye .
you should put them out, let people see them .
yeah .
they'd just remind me of something else i never became .
no !
does he have any idea what he is doing to my heart?
do you smell that?
what?
like flowers?
gardenias .
no .
now it's gone .
that drives me crazy !
weren't you happy to get a new heart?
what?
you don't think i'm grateful?
you don't think i wake up at night and hear it beating and just not understand why i should be so lucky?
sometimes i think they just wasted this on me .
he thinks too much .
maybe i just don't know how to use it .
i know you've been sick your whole life , and maybe you've just been sick for so long , you don't know how to be well .
look, there's no reason for you to listen to me and there's no reason for you to trust me .
i'm just ... there's someone i'd like you to meet , someone i think you'd have something ... profound in common with .
i think you'd both get a lot out of it .
you have to have an open mind, though .
who?
cliff aimes, i'd like you to meet gwen alexander .
sorry .
you just look so familiar .
hi .
well, um ... we have a table all ready, so ... well, why don't you two go on ahead , and we'll be in in a minute .
we will?
i'm starving .
then why don't you show them the table and come back out and talk to me for a minute?
all right .
what are you doing?
you were supposed to introduce him to me .
semantics .
you said you wanted to see him .
you said nothing about meeting him .
he's not her type .
look, we'll talk about this later .
lucy, you have some's plaining to do .
i just want give them a few minute alone, let them talk
maybe we should order .
yeah .
you said that i looked familiar .
what did you mean?
like i've seen you somewhere before .
i get like this a lot lately .
do you smell that?
the bread?
no .
uh, sweet ...
like gardenia?
oh, that's my perfume .
it's too much, maybe .
no .
no, i
i've been smelling it for such a long time ,
i just i can never figure out where it's coming from .
excuse me .
there's a couple over there in the corner, breaking up .
i think they need you more than we do right now .
thank you .
play a happy song, at least .
what sort of work do you do?
i'm a teacher, fourth grade .
i haven't felt much like working since ...
i love kids .
they're the only original thinkers in the world .
really?
do you have any kids?
no .
hell, no .
i've had a lot of health problems lately , so i figured i'd never be around long enough to .. have them .
sorry .
did i say something?
no .
i'm sorry .
i do this a lot lately .
me, too .
you cry?
especially lately .
i don't know why .
i just ...
i'll see something the look on someone's face or ...
or the way a dog watches me ... and all of a sudden, i just ... can't stop crying .
are you ok?
i'm sorry .
i have to go .
excuse me .
was that a date?
did it feel like one?
considering she left before we even ordered food ,
i'd say, roughly, yes .
that's my usual date .
but what did you think of her?
i feel like ... i know her .
how weird is that?
i felt ... ah, forget it .
ooh .
forget it .
no .
she's someone worth knowing .
take a chance .
why?
look, you're all about avoiding .
i get it .
why did you accept that heart?
was it to avoid death, or was it to choose life?
i think you owe me an explanation .
ok, it seemed to me like cliff and gwen might have some things in common .
me .
she doesn't need this .
can't you see how much pain she's in?
we had a deal .
you promised you would cross over .
gwen's not ready .
conor, let me me honest .
it's not gwen that has the problem here .
it's you .
and it's not like she doesn't want to move on , it's that you won't let her .
that is ridiculous .
i don't interfere in any way .
she feels your presence .
she know you're there , and you're holding her back by staying in her life , and this thing with cliff it's not about him .
it's about her taking a step .
it's about her moving forward and you letting go .
she loves me .
i know that, conor and i know that you love her, too .
but she can't love a dead man not the way that you want her to , and you can't love her the way that she wants you to the way that she needs you to , and it's not right to expect it .
everything all right?
yeah .
sorry if we woke you .
this one's having a bit of a boundary problem .
don't they all?
ok .
let's have gwen decide .
what?
tomorrow .
we'll ask gwen straight out what she wants , and i'll respect her wishes but if she says that she wants me to stay with her ...
i want you to leave us both alone .
it was a very intereresting conversation .
i asked the tax board who paid my bill , and they said it was one andrea moreno .
i didn't want you to know .
obviously .
how do you have this kind of money?
i have a little nest egg put away .
and it's fine, ok?
so don't worry .
i i'm ... stunned .
and ...
i can't i can't accept it .
it's just too much .
look, just pay me back when you can afford it, ok?
or, better yet, um ... what? you could accept the $15, 000 as a down payment .
for what?
for ... making me your partner .
andrea, i already consider you my partner .
melinda, i love it here .
you know, i love the people , and i love this place , and i have a little bit of money put away , and i could pay you something really fair , and we could grow this place together .
i don't know what to say .
well ... say , " yes . " i mean ...
yes , " is all you have to say .
you could say , " yes .
yes .
yeah?
yes?
yes, i would love for you to be my partner .
oh, thank you so much .
you don't know how much this means to me .
i'm so happy .
partner, partner
my life just got much easier
i've been doing a lot of thinking lately about the whole manwoman thing and why i've never been too good at it .
maybe it's because
i would always hide inside my illness .
i never had to give too much .
i never had to take too much .
after all, i had other things to worry about ,
like " would i be alive next week?
and after a while, i ...
i stopped thinking about it , and it got easier to be alone , didn't have to take any chances , the joys of a risk free life .
and now ...
i have this ... strong, new heart ... and i can feel it beating inside my chest ,
like it wants to come out ,
like it's saying , " give me more .
and ... i don't want to ... stop this feeling, but ...
i wanna fill it .
like i, uh ...
i have to fill it .
and i don't even know if i know ... how, exactly .
but i'm gonna try .
can he be talking about gwen?
you never told me what you thought of cliff .
is conor here?
you can speak freely .
i did like cliff .
i did .
he was funny .
i feel like i'm being unfaithful .
it's like conor is my guardian angel .
it's so comfortable when he's here, so familiar .
so safe?
being with cliff, even for a few minutes last night, it was ... fun .
i feel like i knew him .
we talked about kids for a second , and it made me want to go back to work .
but i crave conor so much .
conor .
i love you so much .
all i want is to be with you every day and every night .
just like it used to be .
will you will you tell her that, please?
he's telling you that he loves you , that he wants to be with you all the time .
i love you, too, conor .
but i don't want you to live a risk free life .
you shouldn't waste your heart on a dead man .
he's letting you go, gwen .
no .
no, conor .
no .
i didn't mean what i said before .
i want you .
don't ... let me go .
i can't do this without you .
that's why i have to go .
what is he saying?
what ... he's leaving .
gwen , he's crossing over .
wait until after i go, and then tell her when she thinks of all the things we did ... it'll remind her that love is possible .
conor ... what?
she'll find it again .
i will .
what?
what ... what is he saying?
i love you .
he's gone .
he's gone .
i have been dying to do this since we moved here .
saturday night, grandview players . " high drama .
i just hope the theater isn't haunted .
be nice to sit through the entire play .
hey .
you know, cliff and gwen saw this last week, and they loved it .
what do you think's gonna happen with those two?
who knows?
it almost doesn't matter .
you know, they're good for each other right now . that's all that counts .
right now ... is all that counts .
mm .
you think so?
as in , " why don't you and i sneak out right now?
don't you have a life to save or two?
probably .
whatever .
yeah .
i should get back to work, too .
