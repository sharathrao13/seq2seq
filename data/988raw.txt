hey , coach , how you been?
lynn swann .
now , why ain't i surprised ... to see you snoopin 'around my football field first day of practice?
well , that's because you got a good lookin 'football team .

the only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners .
hey , here comes the shithead .

any unused magic in that legendary green playbook of yours , red?
i may have a couple squirrelled away in there ... for a rainy day .

not exactly what i'd call constructive criticism .
smell like you could use a shower , stinky .
listen , you you could think what you want a about my personal hygiene , oh ! but , please , don't don't waste any water .
that that's bad policy . lf you need to amuse yourself at my expense , just just rough me up or something .

laski , get over here !
yes , sir , coach?
what is that moron doin 'here?
huh , huh?
didn't i tell you as plain as i could speak to get rid of his ass last year?
yes , sir , but i didn't think you were serious , coach .
disrupting my football team , you idiot?

shoot , mr b.
captain lnsano ,
i notice sometimes when you are wrestling or or openin 'up a can of whoop ass , as you like to say
you seem to be sweating quite profusely .
i was wondering if , perhaps , you might need ...

i know the answer to this question .
raise your hand . anybody? anyone?
yes , sir .
you , sir .
mama says that alligators are ornery ...
'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush .
yo mama said , alligators are ornery 'cause they got all them teeth ... and no toothbrush .
wow ! anybody else?
yes , sir .
you , sir . alligators are aggressive because of an enlarged medulla oblongata .
it's the sector of the brain which controls aggressive behaviour .
that is correct !
the medulla oblongata .
the medulla oblongata ... is where anger , jealousy and aggression come from .
now , is there anybody here can tell me where happiness comes from?
no , man . anyone?
all right , let's hear what mama has to say on the subject .
mama say that happiness is from magic rays of sunshine that

that that that's a good question . in the right position all the time?
what what happens is , the the the centre has has the ball first . and and and the quarterback will say , " hike .
that's when the c center puts the ball in into the hands of the quarterback .
so what i do is , l i start tacklin 'the quarterback , unless he give the ball to to s somebody else , in which case , l i try to tackle that person .
hmm?
don't smoke crack .

my god , bobby , i mean , sometimes , i just don't know why i bother with you .
you ain't even a man .
it looks like the cinderella s. c. l. s. u. mud dogs ,
led by linebacker bobby boucher , are gonna fall one victory short of that bourbon bowl bid .
lowa could win the game by nailing this 20 yard field goal .
yeah , but the mud dogs have played a sensational football game .
let's take a look at the way boucher entered the hawkeyes 'last drive .
here we see boucher instantly penetratin 'the pocket .
there's a lot of pain and shame in those eyes .
friends , it's all over .

wow , that is a disturbing image .

with yesterday's come from behind victory , the s. c. l. s. u. mud dogs ... earned a new year's day date with red beaulieu and the louisiana cougars ... in the first annual bourbon bowl .
but not only has the waterboy changed s. c. l. s. u. 's fortunes , he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent .
ln fact , yesterday , michigan , devastated by injury , experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver .
but the towel boy ran into [ cheering ]
you know , when i see so many of you here tonight , it reminds me just about how special this season really was .
not just for the team .
not just for the students .
but for each and every one of you ... in our small corner of louisiana !
you can do it !
oh , yes , we can , and , yes , we will .
because we've got ... a young man who has been so vital to our success . a wonderful student athlete .
and a wonderful friend .
ladies and gentlemen , bobby boucher !
** [ band ]
waterboy , number one !
you can do it !
thank you so much ... for bein 'my friends .

i'd also like to take this opportunity ... to tell you that my mama don't know how i play football , so if if you could not tell my mama l i play football , [ cheering ]
** [ band resumes ]
we must be a little lost .
we're tryin 'to get to the bourbon bowl .
looks like we ended up in retardville , u. s. a .
hey , waterboy , you fixin 'to tackle all of us?
kick his water lovin 'ass , greg .
i asked you a question , dumb ass .

i mean , whatever it is , we don't want this to get physical .
right , klein?
yeah , well , your team actin 'like a bunch of shitheads .
this is not how ambassadors for the university of louisiana
so now you just get back on the bus .

however , assault with a deadly weapon , very , very serious offence .
officer , get her little country ass outta here .
thank you , vicki .
let's go . ah !
it's the waterboy !
i got something for you .
this is his transcript from south lafayette high school ... in cherokee plains , louisiana .
now , the problem with that ... is there ain't no south lafayette high school in cherokee plains , louisiana .
so obviously , this is a fake !
however , this is not a fake .
this is from the n. c. a . a .
they don't think you ought to play football no more .
you're fired .
oh , no !
we suck again !
ever see a championship ring?
don't be messin 'with the champ .
come on , laski .
i was home schooled .
l i didn't know i needed  you didn't go to high school?
forged a fake transcript .
no , no , l l i didn't .
the waterboy's a cheater .
cut his head off .
listen , everybody !
this don't change nothin '!
we played as a team , we won as a team . and just because the waterboy's a cheater , don't change the fact that the real mud dogs ... are gonna kick some cougar ass .

thank you so much .
bye bye .
good news , bobby .
the n. c. a . a . is gonna allow you to play in the bourbon bowl .
you just have to pass the high school equivalency test .
yes .
it's not the test , coach .
everybody hates me .
that's not true .
one man said he wanted to decapitate me .
nobody else thought that to be too bad of an idea .
somebody made me look like a a a cheater .
i did it .
i did it .
i did it !
i did it !
i did it !
it was me .
why?
because i wanted you to play .
because you were my way out , bobby .
'cause it was the only way to get you in .
i am so sorry .
why didn't you s stick up for me down by the river?
the truth is , i fled .
i came into my office , i went under my desk , i cried .
i cried .
i cried like a ten year old girl !
red and i have a history .
twenty years ago , we were assistants to coach cavanaugh ... at the university of louisiana .
red ran the practices , and i used to come up with the plays .
oh , boy , was i good .
i would write these foolproof plays in my little green notebook that i had .
the opposition didn't even know what hit 'em . and when coach cavanaugh was going to retire , [ door knocking ]
me and red , we just knew that one of us was gonna be his successor .
** [ disco ]
hey , red .
how ya doin '?
come by to wish me luck?
well , not exactly , no , no . actually , i come by to get you
sure .
what's up?
well , you know that green notebook you use to write
well , i need to show cavanaugh that i can come up with some good play ideas . all them football plays in?
but you didn't come up with them .
they're my plays .
i need them .
klein , i'm gonna have this book one way or another , so you might as well let the damn thing go , 'cause if you don't , it's gonna get awfully , awfully physical around here . and i don't think you want that , do you?
huh?
of course , red got the job .
next day , fired me .
once he had my notebook , he didn't need me any more .
i didn't take it very well .
no , grandma , i didn't get it .
i can't believe it myself .
i know .
i'm so numb .
i just hate him , i hate him , i hate him .
that is a terrible story , coach .
but why why don't you just come up with some new plays?
i can't .
yes .
i tried .
i guess i have a mental block , you know , ever since red took
i knew what he was gonna do ! and i just didn't fight back .
well , you're gonna show him that you're a man on saturday .
and i'm gonna show everybody that i'm not a dummy .
i'm gonna go study .
** [ fiddle ]
mama , maybe you could stop brushin 'my hair so i can read .

bobby boucher , all these folks are here tonight ... to tell you that they're sorry that they're sorry for not supportin 'you ... when it meant the most .
but you do have friends , and one of 'em wants to say somethin '.
come on .
i am not what you would call a handsome man .
the good lord chose not to bless me with with charm , athletic ability or a fully functional brain .
you see , you're an inspiration ... to all of us who , who weren't born handsome ... and charming and cool and [ sobbing ]
i can't !
i can't !
it's okay .
bobby , if your mama could only hear us right now , we would tell her ... what a fine boy she raised , and how much your playing football means to this town .
but she can't hear you , 'cause she's unconscious .
i'm sorry to disappoint you all , but please keep your voices down ... so my mama can get her rest .
well , wake her ass up !
we gotta win tomorrow !
mama !
thank god , you're okay .
i'm so sorry .
i was so bad , mama .
you were right about everything .
i've been a real knucklehead .
oh , hush , baby .
you should've seen this a long time ago .
oh , my word !
ls that my daddy?
no , no .
that's a guy i dated before i met your father .
oh , you could iron a shirt on his stomach .
well , that was lust , not love .
turn the page .
there's your daddy .
so handsome .
oh .
read on .
dear helen .
who's helen?
that's my first name , bobby .
ohh !
i have arrived here in new orleans .
it is even more beautiful than in the picture books .
i'm sure i'll have no problem finding work ,
so you can expect my next letter to contain lots of money .
your loving husband , robert .
that's nice , mama .
dear helen .
that's you .
i found a job as a lemonade vendor ,
but sorry , no money yet .
new orleans is an expensive city .
expensive , but fun .
hope all is well .
robert .
this will be my last letter .
we have grown apart over these last six weeks .
i now have two loves in my life : " big city livin 'and a voodoo woman named phyilis .
ciao , roberto .
he changed his name to roberto .
i guess he thought it was more exotic .
but mama says that i mean , you say that
bobby , your daddy didn't go into no peace corps .
he deserted us , baby .
no , no , mama .
you you
you shouldn't be dredgin 'up these painful memories in your condition .
oh , hush .
your mama's as healthy as an ox , and as dumb as one to boot .
i was so scared you'd abandon me too . and i made you abandon all those people who depend on ya .
i hid you away from the world , bobby boucher .
but i can't hog you to myself no more , because everyone's seen how wonderful you are .
oh , mama !
now .
you go play fool's ball with your friends .
welcome to abc's coverage of the bourbon bowl .
good afternoon , everybody .
i'm brent musburger , and the big story here , dan , is a game that's lost some of its lustre ... along with my colleague , dan fouts . without its star player , the waterboy bobby boucher .
you know , red's got a couple of solid early rounders out there .
i know , but i really wanted to scout that waterboy .
reminds me of greg lloyd .
naw .
zack " thomas .
whatever .
ls she ready?
oh , yeah .
she's more than ready .
come on , bobby !
you'll miss the boat !
let's go , ladies .
we are underway !
the opening kickoff is a beauty !
holdsworth is gonna bring it out from nine yards deep .
come on .
yeah !
dan , they're showing no respect for this team without boucher .
good reason , brent .
109 yards untouched .
touchdown , cougars !
they strike first .
time running down in the first quarter .
cougars lead is 17 0 .
set !
three !
thirty three !
three !
thirty three !
hut !
dan , that quarterback can't even get the ball off before he's hit .
it's as if they're in the offensive huddle with him .
are you gonna finish that hot dog , jimmy?
ugh !
now i'm not .
mama , you think we'll make it on time?
hang on !
i'll show you what a . j. foyt taught me .
that's the end of the half .
the cougars are dominating .
let's hope the mud dogs can make some adjustments .
well , they better , 'cause they suck .
mm hmm .
anybody got an idea?
hey .
remember the time bobby tackled the referee by mistake?
yeah , that was pretty funny .
how about the time he tackled the guy from louisville ...
and threw him into the stands?
y'all remember when he intercepted the ball and his pants fell off? and then he ran for the touchdown , bare assed .
remember the time bobby [ mumbling lncoherently ]
remember when bobby boucher showed up at halftime and the [ cheering , shouting ]
hey , sorry about givin 'you so much shit this year .
you're the heart and soul of this team , bobby . and the only one of us who could've passed that test .
thank you all so much for being my friends .
well , let's wait till later to hold hands and kiss .
right?
yeah !
we got a bowl game to win .
two , three !
mud dogs !
woof !
ln a dramatic turn of events ,
bobby boucher just arrived at halftime . and on a fan boat , brent .
his mother drove him right into the stadium .
waterboy !
waterboy !
waterboy !
waterboy !
waterboy !
waterboy !
fool's ball's not for the devil .
it's for my bobby .
time to open up some whoop ass .
shit , he showed up . all right , look .
just relax .
relax .
go in there and do exactly like we planned .
go , go , go !
this could be the start of some high drama , folks .
or are the mud dogs too far behind?
bobby boucher is on defence .
the cougars are coming out from their own 20 yard line .
the pitch .
it's a reverse !
hut !
hut !
boucher's not fooled .
fumble !
robideaux's got it !
touchdown , mud dogs !
boy , boucher knocked the poop out of him .
slap hands !
slap hands !
drink up , now .
i want you girls to sober up .
have faith in my bobby .
the mud dogs are faced with yet another third and long .
hut !
grenouille back to pass .
he's gonna be stuffed again ! and the mud dogs offence is
but the way their defence is fired up , they still have still unable to move that ball .
blake , come here .
look .
now , what if we , uh [ whispering ]
trust me .
go , go , go , go , go .
the cougars lead 27 7 in the middle of the third quarter . and he takes a knee?
y'all gonna play or what?
how do you all like my new offence?
all right , it's second and 12 ...
as the cougars line up on the ball .
hut !
hut !
what is red beaulieu doing , refusing to play offence?
dan , this is bizarre .
no , it's not , brent .
it's brilliant , because red is taking the waterboy out of the game .
by kneeling down three times and punting , he's gonna make the mud dog offence try to beat him . and the way they're playing today , that's impossible .
well , the mud dog's most valuable player , the linebacker they call " the waterboy , " is now powerless .
that means coach klein will have to find another way to outfox red .
mud dogs call a time out .
mr coach klein .
mr coach klein !
mr coach klein !
where are you going?
i was just gonna get a hot pretzel .
mr coach klein , are you afraid of red beaulieu?
i am petrified of him .
well , why don't you pretend that red beaulieu ... is somebody that you're you're not afraid of . pretend?
yes .
visualize somebody you're not afraid of . and then attack , like you told me .
i'll try .
well , he's right over there .
little baby .
yeah .
hello , little baby .
a poo poo?
do you have a poo poo?
yes .
okay .
now .
this is what we're gonna do .
he's gonna come here [ chattering , shouting ]
come and get this one , cougars .
red , 22 !
hike !
snap to grenouille . a reverse !
no , it's a double reverse !
oh , what a block ! and boudier springs free !
trouble !
lateral !
got him !
what a play !
grenouille to the 15 !
to the 10 !
to the 5 !
touchdown , mud dogs !
well , well , well .
i guess coach klein does have a few tricks up his sleeve after all .
what the hell what the hell is this?
huh?
we go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs !
right now , we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man , lynn swann .
swannie , what do you have for us?
i'm with vicki vallencourt , who's taking over ...
bobby boucher's water duties for this important game .
oh , i'm not takin 'over .
i'm just tryin 'not to screw up too bad .
well , let me ask you this .
what's your prediction for
mud dogs are gonna win , 30 to 27 . the rest of this ball game?
that's very interesting .
how'd you come up with that guess?
guess?
that ain't no guess !
that's what it's gonna be .
okay .
that's fine .
oh !
be careful down there , swannie .
all right .
meaney .
where's meaney?
meaney?
here , coach .
get in there and let's see if that waterboy can stop you .
red is sending his best defender in as a running back?
yes , sir !
what do you make of this , dan?
well , brent , he's gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy .
he probably thinks that meaney will just pound it in there like
hey , waterboy ! ls your girlfriend gonna save you again?
fridge used to do for the bears .
oh , no , sir .
i'm gonna take matters into my own hands .
you'll see .
bring it to the hole !
whoo !
whoo !
you sound like a ... a big choo choo train .
whoo !
power bomb , compliments of captain lnsano .
* let's go fight with your might ** all right , field goal .
field goal .
go .
derek .
derek !
yeah .
visualize the attack .
go kick the ball .
kick it .
hut !
how you doin ', boy?
no , no , no !
what the hell is that?
where the hell is what the hell is he up to?
that ain't in here !
huh?
hey !
down by ten late in the fourth quarter ,
coach klein opts for the field goal .
then they have to hope for the onside
dan , look what we have here .
boucher's in the game as a blocker . kick and a touchdown to tie the game .
last game of the year , brent .
can't hold anything back now .
set !
the snap .
it's a fake !
boucher's out in front ! a great block !
and a second one !
touchdown , mud dogs !
boucher led him all the way !
yeah !
red beaulieu is steaming , dan .
brent , he sees his perfect season slipping away .
the cougar's lead is down to three .
the mud dogs need the ball back if they're gonna have a shot at overtime . and bobby boucher is now on the kickoff team .
last game of the year , brent .
can't hold anything back now .
who's it gonna be?
i know .
who's it gonna be?
who's it gonna be?
oh , yeah .
there's my bitch .
remember , the ball must travel ten yards .
it's loose !
mud dogs football !
mud dogs football ! all right !
mama , i got the football !
i got it
oh , what a vicious hit !
that was a cheap shot .
oh !
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie .
dan , i'm not sure that boucher is able to get back up .
it's still cold .
oh , my baby !
excuse me .
out of my way .
dan , you hate to see this happen .
now , that's high quality h2o .
you go on , now !
the waterboy just needed some water .
make it happen , bobby !
wow , dan .
you think that up all by yourself?
are you okay?
shut up , brent .
he tried to open up a can of whoop ass on me .
i wouldn't let him .
listen , i have an idea for the last play .
you haven't done this before . all right?
the offence is gonna line up like this .
yeah .
you're gonna be right here .
there'll be no tie here today .
coach klein is sending his offence back on to the field .
he's going for the win right now .
yeah , this is a real gutsy call , brent .
he'll either be a hero or a goat because of this .
he is now playing offence !
we know .
we know .
meaney , if they give that waterboy the football ,
i don't care if you have to stab him !
do not let him get away .
do you understand me?
yes , sir .
yes , sir !
do you understand me?
get in there !
break !
i'm ready , friend .
let's do it , bobby .
set !
set !
forty three !
set !
forty three !
hut , hut !
touchdown !
they win it !
the mud dogs win it !
bobby boucher's the hero !
he's gone from waterboy , dan , to saviour ! and it's because he didn't hold anything back !
well , swannie's down on the field with our hero , so let's go to lynn now !
we did it !
i can't believe it !
i can't believe it !
vicki , i love you !
whoo !

* every time i kiss your lips *
* my mind starts to wander *
* and if all my dreams come true *
* i'll be spending time with you *
* i love you more today than yesterday *
* but not as much as tomorrow *
* oh , i love you more today than yesterday *
* but , darling , not as much *
* as tomorrow *
* tomorrow may see springtime just a day away *
* day away *
* cupid , we don't need you now be on your way *
* on your way *
* thank the lord for love like ours *
* that grows ever stronger *
* and if all my dreams come true *
* i'll be spending time with you *
* oh , i love you more today than yesterday *
* but not as much as tomorrow *
* oh , i love you more today than yesterday *
* but , darling , not as much *
* as tomorrow *
* every day's a new day *
* every time i love ya *
* every way's a new way *
* every time i love ya * * every day *
* every day's a new day * * every day *
* every time i love ya * * every day *
* every way's a new way * * every day *
* every time i love ya *
* every time i love ya * * every day *
* every day *
* every time i love ya * * every day *
* every day *
* every time i love ya * * every day *
