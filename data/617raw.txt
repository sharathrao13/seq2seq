i i was just ...
did you get that passport?
yes .
i have issues .
issues , jerry .
it burns my ass to write you a cheque every week .
i can explain what happened .
you say that when it's once in a while .
it's every time , jerry .
it's every fuckin 'time .
and i can certainly understand that perspective .
but i've been having some personal problems ... uh , with my life .
my girlfriend , she's a great girl , but she has complaints .
i don't but , she does .
if you want to know the truth ,
i can't even believe this , but we go to a group .
so ... last week , when you guys told me to pick up the thing at the thing , well , samantha says she needs the car to pick up some things .
and , i don't have to tell you boys , i mean , things got heated , right?
and she hid them .
she hid them?
oh !
the keys .
she hid them .
she ...
you know , and i couldn't get to the thing on time , and it all got messed up and i think that maybe ...
maybe some things aren't meant to happen .
jerry , you're a fucking moron .
here are your options .
number one , i roll you up in a carpet , stuff you in a sedan and set fire to you .
you with me?
choice one .
yeah .
number two .
you like sex and travel??
what , you like to have sex?
you like to travel??
get on a flight to mexico .
all the hookers you can shake your stick at .
pick up a pistol that belongs to margolese .
what's it gonna be?
ok , i was under the impression with margolese getting out of jail , that the last job was my last job .
you fucked up that job .
you fucked it up .
this job will be your last job .
ok , but a trip right now ...
he asked for you .
want me to call him and say you can't go?
because i'll call .
i'd love to .
you're goin 'on a fucking trip .
the town's called san miguel .
you look for a kid in a bar , the el alamo .
this is a simple fucking task .
write it down .
roll up your sleeves .
get involved !
ow !
the kid's name is beck .
he's got this particular gun .
he's waiting on you .
beck .
when you find him , bring him and the gun back stateside , got it?
last chance , jerry .
i'm telling you .
the last .
even he's getting tired of your shit .
i'll take care of it , bernie .
vaya con dios , motherfucker .
you're in coach .
baby , what are you doing?
you said this was your last job !
what do you want me to say?
sorry i can't ,
the old lady wants me to quit .
fuck off .
yes !
something like that .
like exactly !
i'm not in insurance , sweetie !
if you get on that plane , you will never , never , ever see me again .
you got me?
we talked about this .
i told you .
i wanted us to go to las vegas for me .
not you , me .
baby , you're overreacting .
ok?
don't do that !
don't you do that !
don't diminish my needs .
sweetheart , i don't have a choice .
i gotta go .
i go down there , i come right back .
" i , i , i , i , i !
i wonder what the group would have to say about that .
no .
you cannot use that against me !
we are not even married , but i go .
the group thinks we're married .
i accepted the potato slicer for our anniversary .
right , sweets?
i go along .
that's it .
that is it .
you ...
you ...
you go along !
you don't want to get married .
and this is the way you deal with it !
huh?
you're back to the same old selfish , self involved , vile , disgusting ...
oh , god .
you are ...
.. self !
you're missing the grand design here !
if i don't go , i'm dead .
yeah .
and it's difficult to have a relationship if i'm stuffed with formaldehyde .
now , if anyone is being selfish ...
oh !
now you blame shift?
you are blame shifting?
stop analysing !
i'm calling a time out !
ah !
all right ...
jerry , i want you to acknowledge ... that my needs mean nothing to you and you're selfish .
oh , my god !
jerry , acknowledge .
i ...
ok .
i will acknowledge that i promised i would go to vegas with you .
but now we're just slightly delayed .
if you want to construe my wanting to stay alive as being selfish , ok .
i have every intention of going with you .
your needs are important to me .
come on .
look at all my stuff here , all over the pavement .
come on , baby .
huh?
what do you say?
ok?
i'm going with or without you , jerry .
what's it gonna be?
a bastard !
a bastard .
what happened to , uh , " sweetheart " and " big love "?
all those things you called me last night?
the only thing i'm interested in calling you is a cab !
excuse me , speak english?
excuse me , you speak english?
what?
all set , mr welbach .
if you go to the front , a shuttle will take you to your car .
what kind of car is it?
it's a chrysler .
brand new .
yeah .
is there a problem , mr welbach?
you know , it's my first trip to mexico and ... a chrysler?
i mean , i drive a chrysler in america .
i thought you might have something more authentic , a little more ...
mexican?
you know , get into the spirit?
your first time?
yeah .
wow .
exciting .
do you speak spanish , mr welbach?
huh?
i didn't think so .

come with me .
sorry .
sorry .
this is what they call the mexican .
wow .
yeah , that's pretty .
are you shitting me?
yeah , it's pretty .
can i?
uh huh .
it was made for a rich landowner , a nobleman , by a poor mexican gunsmith .
he fashioned this gun as a gift to go along with the hopes that the nobleman's son would take his daughter's hand in marriage .
'the townspeople waited three months
'to catch the first glimpse of the pistol .
'finally , the day had come .
'no one had ever laid eyes on a more beautiful gun .
'it was all they thought it'd be .
'some even thought it was too beautiful to look at .
'it was considered to be an honour and good luck
'to be the first to fire a newly fashioned gun .
'especially one as beautiful as this , made for the hand of a nobleman .
'the townsman was in a trance at the gun's flawless craftsmanship .
'it backfired ...
'killing him instantly . '
legend has it that it's been cursed ever since .
but it hasn't harmed me any though , you know?
i ...
i love to look at it .
( let me show you something .
look , there's a bullet in there . )
( it's handmade .
hand fucking made . )
you don't even want to know what this gun is worth .
we could sell that gun , man .
it's ...
it's a great fucking gun .
and i'm not just talking shit either .
you don't have to be a ...
fuck .
i've been pissin 'on myself .
fuck .
anyway , the old man is nothing to be afraid of .
as a matter of fact , last week i told him to fuck off .
yeah , you did !
that's what i said too !
i said , " fuck off , margolese , you old prune shit ass !
if you ...
come on , fella .
get up .
huh?
man , you're soaked in your own urine .
don't make me carry you .
hey !
ah , this is my life .
all right .
yeah , baby .
i got the touch .
oh !
buddy , you whacked your noggin !
hey .
oh , f ...
ooh .
hey , man .
hey .
oh , shit !
oh , shit !
stop that !

christ !
i found the gun .
'the gun is in your possession? '
as we speak .
but , like i said , there's , uh ...
there's a problem .
what?
you lost the kid?
he's a souse , he'll be in another bar .
the kid's dead , ted .
ted , are you hearing me?
yeah .
i i heard you .
how?
bad luck , act of god , fuck if i know .
all these maniacs shooting guns up into the sky .
it's independence day or something .
the kid got tagged by a loose one .
right in the fuckin 'head .
i mean ...
fu ...
he's dead !
the kid's dead .
the little fucker's in my car right now , dead .
geez , jerry , that's not a little problem .
'that's a big problem . '
i know .
jerry , that little fucker is margolese's grandson .
what?
what?
'geez , you really fucked it this time . '
what did i have to do with it?
one minute he's pissin ', next he's dead .
'don't even move . '
i'll phone the office now .
i'll get me on a plane and straighten shit out .
ted , you gotta get word to the old man .
i didn't know who he was .
ok .
just sit tight , jerry .
hello?
ted?
ted?
hello?
hey !

oh , no !

why?
i'm gonna be sick .
just open ...
she told me , " don't go .
i don't want you on that highway alone .
i said , " it'll be fine , mom .
it'll be ok . " but it's not , is it?
i'm dead .
well , you're not dead .
you would have been dead if i hadn't saved your life .
would you rather it was you back there?
i didn't think so .
are you gonna kill me?
depends on too many variables to answer .
are you gonna rape me?
that's not likely , no .
well , what do you want?
i suspect the same thing as the other guy .
the pistol .
the one that jerry's havin 'a hard time coming back from mexico with .
jerry?
i work for bernie nayman , who works for arnold margolese .
you heard of these people .
yeah , i have .
and your husband works for 'em .
no .
well , he does .
i know the selfish , no good liar works for them .
he isn't my husband .
well , whatever he is to you , jerry is in the shit books .
when you're in as much shit as he is , you get skittish about your future .
clouds your judgement .
there's a lot of people interested in that gun .
so what we got here is a ...
he who controls the girl , controls the pistol " situation .
i'm a hostage?
you blew that guy to pieces for a fucking gun?
this is so jerry .
look ...
sit down .
sit down .
um ...
uh , uh ...
look .
jerry and i broke up , so if he's doing ...
i don't know what he's doing .
it's got nothing to do with me .
you seem like a very nice girl .
thank you .
but it's a fact , in these life threatening situations , human beings ... lie .
so you are gonna kill me .
all right , look .
if everything goes ok and jerry comes through without this getting funky ,
i don't think that'll happen .
he gives me the pistol , i give you to him .
i'm just here to regulate funkiness .
ok?
go on .
great .
hyah .
hyah !
hyah !
come on , buddy .
come on , ok?
just you and me .
yeah .
go !
go .
oh !
you're such an ass .

i'm sorry !
i didn't mean ...
fuck !

'i have a collect call for samantha from jerry welbach .
'no one there , sir . '
'give it a second . '
sam , pick up the phone .
sams?
samsonite?
baby , please don't do this .
'please try again , sir 'no !
just give it a second .
she's there ...
what are you doing?
you're gonna make a call .
to whom?
to jerry .
you're gonna tell him that leroy is with you then you hang up .
leroy?
yeah .
leroy , that's right .
then you're gonna hang up .
simple .
that's it?
it's enough .
believe me .
you gonna make the call or do i have to make you?
cos i will .
no .
i'll call .
good .
dial it .
ok .
what's the number?
you have the number .
i don't know where he is .
you should have the number .
what are you tellin 'me?
you don't have a number , a motel , nothing?
what's the matter , don't you listen?
we broke up .
no longer together .
why would i have the number?
i'm sensing you have trust issues .
you got one minute .
i'm a professional .
i do this for a living .
goody for you .
you're wasting your time .
# you're nobody till somebody loves you ... #
i think i believe you .
# you're nobody till somebody cares ...
what's in vegas?
uh , well ... i'm gonna be a waitress , then make a career as a croupier .
they can make $100, 000 a year but you have to have the hands , which i do .
i got them from grandma vega , which is a good thing cos my granny barzel had hands like a circus midget .
how come you can't live with jerry?
do you know jerry?
he has trouble expressing feelings .
he had a fucked up childhood .
his mom is nuts .
one of those people who thinks the iron is always on .
don't you love him?
i think that's the problem .
we love each other too much .
but he's ...
he's so selfish .
it's like we've been living his life forever .
he'd tell you a different story , but i give and he just keeps taking .
our counsellor totally agrees with me , by the way .
i don't put much stock in those counsellor types .
all they do is sit around and smoke joints .
maybe , but jerry is still a taker and i'm a giver .
it's obvious .
a lot of people are under the impression that you get to choose who you love .
i'm sorry , are you ...
are you taking his side?
you're a man , of course .
you're taking his side .
you love him .
you said so yourself .
it's all that matters .
you're a very sensitive person for a killer .
thank you , sam .
shit .
get .
get out .
out .
look , you gotta get out .
get out !
go !
hola , shithead !
where's my stuff?
get back !
where's my stuff?
pistol .
pistolero .
get back .
la pistola .
get back !
stay calm .
get back , get back !
don't move .
what the f ...?
give me those .
back !
back , back .
get in the car .
get in !
ok .
is that my ...?
is that my jacket?
put it in the car !
what is wrong with you people?
get back !
you don't have to be in here .
i go by track record .
i don't hear any tinkle , tinkle .
stage fright .
look around , there's not even a window .
so what's with this " we've been livin 'his life forever " thing?
i didn't mean it literally .
jerry's been working for margolese for five years less a day .
it just feels lifelong .
sounds like jail terms .
it is .
arnold margolese is in jail because jerry put him there .
jerry ratted out arnold margolese?
no .
jerry was coming across ventura , over there by laurel canyon .
yeah?
he wasn't paying attention , ran a red light , smashed into margolese's cadillac .
when the cops came , margolese got busted cos he had a person in the trunk .
that's how margolese got sent to jail??
mm hmm .
live person or dead person?
live person .
huh .
what's the big deal , then?
he probably wasn't gonna stay that way .
he was taped up in a trunk for a reason , wasn't he?
i would think this was right up your alley , swifty .
he saw something?
whatever it was this guy saw , or was going to say to the cops , he got the chance .
since it was jerry's fault , margolese had him work off the jail time .
my whole relationship has been hijacked because he doesn't pay attention when he drives .
i ...
i can't go with you in here .
we didn't think we were getting a dead man with the car .
i got no use for a dead gringo .
take a left .
come on .
if you're going to kill me , at least tell me who it is that's going to send me to god .
tell me !
look , i'm not gonna kill you .
but i am gonna have to shoot you .
but why , sir?
why?
why?
because you stole from me , you know about the pistol and you'll steal again .
i can't have you coming back like a fly in the ointment .
i won't be a fly !
you'll never see me again .
you're gettin 'shot , that's it .
it'll take time to walk to town , especially limping ...
wait , wait .
limping?
can't you just tie me up some more?
fuck !
you shoot me?
tie me !
yeah .
i don't have a rope .
so you shoot me?
it's the american way .
where do you want it?
ok .
not the leg !
there's arteries .
i could bleed to death in seconds .
the foot .
that's fair where i come from .
ok?
it'll hurt , but it'll heal .
what if you take off a fucking toe !
wait , wait , wait .
not the left .
oh , sorry .
on the count of three .
one ...
look , i'm agreeing with you .
but there's a few ways to look at it .
sex is , no matter what anybody says , a very important part of any relationship .
the fact that jerry is a considerate lover says a lot .
you lost me .
well , he's a considerate lover .
you gotta find a way to get him to expand this quality he has during sex to other areas of your relationship .
even if it only comes out in sex , it's there just the same .
that's a good point .
if a person's a considerate lover , he can't be all selfish , right?
unless of course he's ...
he's , uh , being a considerate ...
what was that?
what?
that .
that moment you had .
what moment?
leroy , you just checked out that guy and had a moment .
that was a moment .
i don't know if it was a moment .
as in happy?
as in homosexual .
what does my sexual orientation have to do with our conversation?
nothing .
nothing .
except something that you said back there really bugged me and this would kind of help it make sense .
yeah?
what's that?
i asked if you were gonna rape me , you said , " not likely .
you said it so coldly , like i was repulsive and it was ludicrous to think i was actually at risk of being raped .
first of all , it's a crime of anger , not attraction .
second of all , you're not repulsive .
you're very beautiful .
thank you .
you want me to rape you?
are you gay?
you want me to rape you?
you're gay .
you're gay .
i knew it !
oh , i so knew it .
i just knew it .
what a relief .
do you want a medal??
a little trinket saying you identified a homosexual??
no .
are you full throttle?
full throttle?
yeah , i guess i am .
oh .
i'm not ...
i mean ...
i'm not trying to be a smart ass or anything like that .
i just ...
i think this is great .
wow .
this is ...
this is ... major , ok?
i ... know the kind of people in your business , ok?
yeah?
and to me , it seems that ...
well , being gay isn't really ... conducive to the environment .
like i should be an interior decorator .
that's insulting .
i am very good at what i do .
do you have a boyfriend?
no , i don't .
unfortunately , i seem to be unable to keep ... relationships together .
seems like everybody's having trouble keeping relationships together .
it's ringing , senor .
thank you for that .
no , no , no .
no necesario .
really?
that's so kind .
you have no idea what ...
'hi , this is ted .
leave a message .
'if this is my guy in need , i'm on my way .
'go to the hotel de la plaza .
wait for me there , ok?
sit tight . '
ok , ok .
forget aeropuerto .
uh , hotel de la plaza .
hola .
is this your dog?
sort of .
came along for the ride .
he has a personality and that does count .
he's a good guy .
is this your car?
it's a rental .
i'm an american .
no shit?
really?
yeah .
i'm mexican .
cool .
do you have a passport?
jerry wellbatch , los angeles , usa .
welbach ...
wellbatch .
can i ask you a question , jerry?
how long have you been in mexico?
a few days .
pleasure .
i see .
pleasure , huh?
yeah .
i see .
can you tell me , uh , what happened here?
that's not accurate , i'm afraid .
the gunsmith did craft this pistol for a prospective husband , and he was a nobleman's son , true .
but the motif was darker , my friend .
it's cursed , this gun .
'the key to this tale involves the gunsmith's assistant , 'a poor , but honourable young man in blinding love
'with the gunsmith's daughter .
'for months at a time , the assistant took to the mines
'gathering the precious metal
'that would yield the most beautiful gun that ever existed ,
'only to discover that what he hoped could be a wedding gift for him ... 'was for another .
'the gunsmith insisted his daughter marry the nobleman's son ,
'forbidding their love .
'angered in his bitter pain , the assistant cursed the gun ,
'vowing the creation would never prevail .
'but the gunsmith was racing against time .
'he had promised a pistol of unparalleled craftsmanship ,
'the nobleman's dowry hanging in the balance .
'he worked day and night to correct the pistol's problems . '
this gun never worked properly .
some say its very creation ended the gunsmith's life .
well , my friend , you're free to go , but without the gun .
this gun doesn't belong to you or to your boss .
now it belongs to me .
yeah , vegas .
it can be tough that way .
expensive?
yeah , emotionally .
i had a serious relationship problem .
well , you fit right in here .
what do you do now , frank?
now ... i am a postman .
get out of here .
that's so rigid .
swear to god .
there's a seedy underbelly to the postal service .
is that the key to it?
that's the key .
you have no idea how many small , unmarked brown paper packages i deliver .
what , porno?
yeah , daily .
like what?
videos , blow up dolls , dildos , pocket pussies .
don't leave nothing out .
oh , yeah?
but even with all that dirty excitement at my fingertips ,
i still have to take off once a year .
i just get up and i know i'm going to vegas , i just don't know how .
all i've got is my wallet and an attitude .
i don't know , it keeps me sane .
after all , guns don't kill people ... postal workers do .
ok , you're all set , mr shurker .
if you go to the front , a shuttle will pick you up .
what kind of car is it exactly?
it's a chrysler , sir , brand new .
you wouldn't happen to have something a little more ...
raoul !
yeah , man !
yeah .
never fear , teddy's here .
how are you?
'rosco ! '
come on , jerry .
the mexican thief , the dirty cop?
the word is out .
it's a big ticket item .
a lot of fucking people are interested in that gun .
no fucking ...
is that what they think?
that i'm selling them out?
maybe they think you're scared and might do the wrong thing .
ted .
you know , i don't know .
i'm just doing my portion here .
yeah , and what is that?
to find out what's going on , assess the damage , try to calm you down , help find the pistol , get us home .
i get on that plane , pistol or not . it'll be the last flight i ever take .
oh , come on , jerry .
" come on "?
you know it .
i know what i have to know .
doing your part .
i know what i have to know .
you sound like schultz from hogan's heroes .
i know nothing !
i don't like nayman running things either .
i got a few years on you and i'm telling you , keep your nose clean ,
look straight ahead and do what you're told .
that's why i nearly paid off boca raton .
i do my fuckin 'portions .
i don't care how you look at it , the first step out of this is to get the pistol back .
i never took a pay off in my life .
jerry , look , i know where your loyalties lie .
but the kid's dead .
the pistol's gone .
i mean , you can see how it looks , right?
come on .
you're my guy .
# we can dance if we want to we've got all your life and mine
# as long as we abuse it , never gonna lose it
# everything will work out right
# i say , we can dance if we want to
# we can leave your friends behind
# cos your friends don't dance and if they don't dance , well they're
# no friends of mine
# i say , we can dance , we can dance , everything's out of control
# we can dance , we can dance
# they're doing it from pole to pole
# we can dance , we can dance , everybody look at your hands ... #
not the safest dance !
i'm not going anywhere .
we are in the city where i'm going to be living .
go .
what's wrong?
huh?
you know when you're in a bad relationship and you separate?
all of a sudden , everywhere you look there's love and possibility .
i'm worried about jerry .
all right , don't worry .
i'll call nayman and check in on everything .
you want me to stay?
i want you to go .
you sure?
i really want you to go .
i couldn't sleep all night .
yeah .
no , he said he followed the cop to the pawn shop .
he's taking me over there after breakfast .
we're booked on the seven o'clock if all goes well .
no , now wait ...
no ...
no , you wait a minute , nayman .
now what do you gotta go and say that for?
well , now or later?
how could i misinterpret?
no , you didn't send the wrong guy .
i'm handling things .
but i never signed up for that .
listen , i promise you , when i tell him , it'll make a difference .
bye .
hey , sweets .
i keep calling and i haven't heard a word from you .
i'm starting to wonder .
i know you're angry with me , but , uh ...
you know , " ain't no sunshine when she's gone " .
ok?
i think she actually went to vegas .
i keep telling you , these women are problems , you know?
you should try to be like me i answer to myself .
no hassles , nobody ridin 'my ass like a goddamn horse in a saddle .
free .
you close yourself off so you have no shot at meeting the right woman .
any woman can be the right woman if the numbers work .
no way .
not me .
you settle .
you open yourself up .
you become vulnerable .
what's the insight into my relationship?
ok , look , jerry .
she is in vegas .
what?
hey , shit falls down , you know?
shit falls down?
margolese called nayman all pissed off cos you were fucking this up , told him to keep an eye on sam in case ...
in case i get any funny ideas .
you're just telling me this now?
there's other things to consider .
like what?
that gun's worth a lot .
people know you have it .
sam could be in danger .
no shit .
who did they put on her?
you don't know him , but you know of him .
who?
that fucking psycho leroy .
leroy !
nayman had to .
it was an order .
margolese would know if he didn't .
wait .
they're just trying to scare me .
well , that would sure do it for me .
we've all heard the kidney story , jerry .
nayman wants us on that seven o'clock flight , pistol in tow .
no buts .
they'll meet us at the airport and then leroy will take the pistol .
yeah .
i had to borrow ...
do you mind?
sleep well?? !
yeah .
you?
who's winston?
somebody i don't like very much .
you can have that removed , you know?
yeah , maybe i will someday .
you wanna get some breakfast?
why can't we be friends? " )
# i've seen you round for a long , long time
# i really remember you when you drank my wine
# why can't we be friends?
why can't we be friends?
# why can't we be friends?
why can't we be friends?
# i seen you walking down in chinatown
# i called you but you could not look around
# why can't we be friends?
why can't we be friends?
# why can't we be friends?
why can't we be friends? #
at first , i thought this guy is all right .
and then i'm thinking he's more than all right , he's terrific .
but there's no way he's gonna feel the same way about me .
then i find out he does .
then i'm thinking ... what happens when he finds out what i do ... and who i am and what i've done?
you know , who am i kidding , right?
let's get serious .
what are you gonna do about it?
that's it .
i didn't have to do anything .
it happened absent of my will to consciously make it happen .
oh , really?
i was a little drunk last night .
i took my gun and i put it in the towels in the bathroom , you know?
and he found it .
and he said , " the past doesn't matter .
it's the future that counts .
leroy .
see , life can change .
people can change .
i haven't cried in 12 years .
what are you lookin 'at?
don't look at me like that .
you're makin 'it worse .
what are you , barbara walters?
it's just beautiful .
let's talk about somethin 'else .
what do you wanna talk about?
anything .
anything else .
whatever .
what was it over , the last time you cried?
let's talk about that .
oh , yeah , that'll bring the sun right out
i heard it was this guy leroy's mother .
ok , that's what we call bullshit .
if i told one guy at the next convention that you kept your mother cut up in the freezer , you'd have a reputation too .
fact or not , it makes no difference .
the guy's a star .
oh , my god .
why are you so worried then if you think it's bullshit?
i met leroy once .
it was for all of two seconds .
i shook his hand .
he seemed like a nice guy .
whether or not he lives up to his legend isn't the point .
or if he sits in his garage soaked in gasoline lighting matches ,
i don't care .
what concerns me is he was hired in the first place .
are you with me?
geez , jerry , you really met him?
oh , my god !
ted is not gonna let anything happen , ok?
i'm here .
thanks , ted .
i feel real safe .
hola .
i no fuck around , comprende?
gun , gun , loaded .
bang , bang .
you , dead .
do you have a speech impediment?
give me the gun .
the pistol .
the pistol??
you know what i'm talkin 'about .
the pistol??
ok , what's your name?
joe .
joe , do what he says and we'll be out of here before you know it .
the pistol , please .
ok .
thank you .
excuse me .
come on .
go .
got it .
just have a seat right here , amigo .
jerry !
have you lost your mind?
what were you talking about on the phone?
put the gun away .
was it to off me?
is that what you two were discussing?
jerry , i would never ...
go ahead , deny it !
go ahead .
go ahead !
ok , ok .
jerry , that's what he said .
so you were lying when you said i'd walk away from this?
no , jerry , that's what he said .
then you're lying to me now .
no , no .
nayman told me to do it , jerry , but ...
but?
but ...
but you're just doing your portion .
isn't that how it works?
17 portions left for boca ...
boca raton , right?
i wouldn't do that .
come on , i swear !
they tell you to bring me in , then they tell you to take me out .
why are you being told two contradicting things?
you don't ask a question?
i i just ...
i ...
i don't know .
you don't think it's weird?
yeah , it's ...
it's weird .
right !
because something's going on .
what is it?
exactly .
you don't know , you're just doing your fucking part .
well , i'm not going down because you don't know !
you see my predicament?
you're my guy , ted .
you're my guy , jerry .
wait .
what happened here?
someone killed themselves .
swan dived off the balcony .
let's go .
stay back .
nothin 'to see here .
walk on .
thank you very much .
sorry to have disturbed you .
hotel security .
no .
please , no .
no .
no .
coming .
sir , there's been a terrible incident .
are all parties in your room accounted for?
yeah .
yeah .
just me and my wife .
honey !
no , that's ok , sir .
thank you .
what happened?
sorry to disturb you .
everything all right?
leroy ...
pack your shit .
shh , shh .
psst .
you're a stupid motherfucker , you know that?
you're well dressed , i'll give you that , but stupid .
wear kevlar?
huh?
yeah .
leroy .
please don't do this .
please .
you think i should listen to her?
huh?
what do you think?
huh?
wanna know what i think?
kevlar is for pussies .
this is for frank .
my bag will make the flight?
they'll run it down .
i just need to see your passport .
yeah .
i'm afraid there's been a mistake .
what?
no !
no !
mr shurker most probably has yours .
i told you , if jerry makes it and nothing gets funky , it'll be ok .
well , shit got funky .
why isn't he here?
why?
why?
give me a second , i'm trying to get the story here .
take it easy and stop acting like a kidnapped chick on a carton of milk .
hmm .
yeah , you're right .
this is an offer for the gun .
yeah .
i can see how this looks .
i've just been trying to get some better numbers together .
you have no intention of giving the gun to margolese .
look , bobby .
you know , i know that you're loyal .
that's good .
i mean , nobody's debating that .
let me ask you , in your skulking around , going through private things in people's offices , did you discover that he's shutting us down?
that's right .
you , me , everybody .
i don't ...
i don't understand .
what , you didn't get the memo , the bonus?
no?
no .
nothing .
me neither .
difference is i know when i'm being fucked and you don't , cos you're standing on the wrong fucking line .
let me help you get on the right side of the line and do for you what he should've done , bobby .
he's changed in prison .
i'm telling you , something's changed him .
he's not the same guy .
they're still holding .
what shall i tell 'em?
can i count on your co operation?
yeah , yeah , bobby .
i'm here .
yeah .
yeah , that's his hotel .
yeah , all right .
sure .
what?
plan b is now in effect .
i hope you don't get airsick .
get in the car .
hola , senor .
hola , senor welbach .
has the us consulate called back yet?
no , sir , not yet .
look , this is a muy , muy important call .
i've lost my passport , ok?
i'll be sitting right there .
i'm not gonna move .
do you see that man over there?
yeah .
that's mr williamson .
so?
he's been waiting for that very same call .
really?
what , the whole morning?
since march , senor .
oh , come on !
hotel de la plaza .
yes , as a matter of fact , he's right here .
senor , it's for you .
oh .
oh .
hey .
yes , hello?
you bastard .
hello?
like , " hello , my life is great .
everything is fine .
sam?
'i thought you could be dead . '
i was worried sick and you answer " hello ,
like you're confirming a room service order? !
sam?
sam?
i'm done with mr jerry welbach .
mr " hi " .
no , no .
'ask about the gun . '
is that leroy?
'did he fucking touch you? '
do you have any idea what i have just been through?
multiply it by 1, 000 and you'll have a vague conception of where i'm at .
oh !
oh , isn't that typical , jerry?
it's all a competition !
tit for tat , tat for tit ...
stop yelling , for christ's sake !
how are you?
are you ok?
are you all right?
'where are you? '
toluca airport , jerry .
and things are shitty , really shitty !
tell him if he shows up with the pistol , it'll be ok .
'he doesn't care .
he only cares about himself . '
why are you airing personal matters with strangers?
oh , let me see .
uh , i don't think that you really classify someone who you just perpetrated a killing with a fucking stranger !
and i can't find my kotex cards or my credit cards ...
sam , what did you say?
jerry , just settle down .
what'd you do to her?
jerry , just settle down .
ok?
yeah .
we had a situation but i'm a professional and i know what i'm doing .
so why don't we chill out a minute here?
'now , what happened?
you get lost? '
yeah , five years ago .
what did you ...?
i can't hear you .
no , nothing .
nothing .
nothing .
i hope you have something .
yeah , you just ...
you don't ...
make sure you return her with all ten toes .
huh?
'i understand .
i understand . '
'just come down here , pick us up .
we'll square things away . '
you got a very special woman here .
but we all know how you can get , right?
'so none of that . '
what?
this is a time for selflessness .
what?
wha ...?
you all right?
yeah , come on .
stupid gun .
out !
i have to ask you a question .
and it's an important one so i want you to think about the answer before you give it to me , ok?
ok .
when two people really love each other but they can't get it together , when do you get to that point where enough is enough?
that ...
oh , well , that's ...
you know?
um , you know it's over when ...
ok , i have , like , these psychosomatic insomniatic manifestations of ...
well , here's the thing about me .
i'm a product of my emotions , not a product of my environment , like him , which he is , exactly , just that environmental ...
i i need sunshine to grow .
that's who i am .
and with the projection of ...
i have goals .
that's your answer?
yeah .
that's not right .
i mean , there's a right answer here , but that's not it .
look , in my business you're surrounded ... by loneliness and finality .
i don't care what your take is on an afterlife , when people die , it's scary , and they go alone .
now , the people that i send off , that have experienced love ...
they're a little less scared .
they're still scared , but there's a calmness to 'em .
i think that comes from the knowledge that somebody somewhere loved 'em and cared for 'em and will miss 'em .
now , i see that from time to time and i am awed by it .
i don't think i'd be telling you this if it wasn't for frank .
anyway , it's a loaded question .
look , when two people love each other , totally , truthfully , all the way love each other , the answer to that question is simple , especially in your case .
when do you get to that point where enough is enough?
never .
never .
i just hope jerry's not stupid .
what is he driving? !
it's a funky rental .
i know we're all a little grouchy right now .
we'll get something to eat , you'll get the pistol and then we'll go our separate ways .
really separate ways .
don't start .
shut up .
i'll start because i have the ...
why do you do that?
do not tell me to shut up .
i count .
we had an agreement .
shut up .
why don't we all shut up a bit?
i swear , i will crash this car .
jerry , don't do that .
i will .
one more word out of you .
another word , sam .
one more word .
i swear to fucking god .
naugahyde .
all right .
jerry !
you finished?
yes !
you gonna shut up?
yes , yes , yes !
jerry , i will , i will !
stop the car , jerry !
stop the car .
stop , stop , stop !
oh , my god !
pendejo !
jerry ... i want you to know , you're the craziest fuck i ever met .
you know what?
go !
go to vegas .
i've had it !
son of a bitch !
i had a flat down in florida once .
out in the middle of nowhere .
so i go to the trunk , there's no spare .
four hours in the baking sun , waiting for a truck to come by .
ow !
now i always check .
let me give it a rip .
sometimes you need a little more torque , you know what i mean?
wouldn't kill the bastards to oil these every once in a while .
fucking car rentals .
yeah .
walk away , baby .
what did you do?
he was gonna kill us .
what the fuck did you do?
look at his head !
stop !
stop !
listen , listen .
i met leroy in 1997 .
and that's not him !
no , no , jerry .
you made a terrible mistake .
he was my friend !
you made a terrible mistake !
baby , leroy is black .
leroy's black .
ok?
no .
yes !
he's black .
no .
african american .
a person of colour .
the guy he killed in vegas is leroy .
that's margolese's leroy .
so , this guy ...
oh , i'm such an ass .
such an ass .
of course .
give the gun to leroy .
he'll get it down to margolese . " ha fuckin 'ha !
you see?
do you see?
i'm being set up !
nayman hires this prick to take out leroy , get the gun and pin it all on jack off jerry .
isn't that right , mr winston baldry?
i met leroy and there's no way you could have known that .
and that's your mistake .
you fucked up .
i can't believe it .
every fucking time .
every fucking time , i fuck up .
not this time .
this time , i win .
this time , i win !
i fucking win !
i win !
oh , my god .
i'm lucky i didn't lose you three days ago .
i wanna go home .
did you call about your passport?
did you call the consulate?
yeah .
do you have enough money?
yeah , i'm all right .
i wanna ask you a question .
it's a good one , so think about it .
if two people love each other ... but they just can't seem to get it together ...
when do you get to that point of enough is enough?
never .
they'll call .
i've left 60 messages .
i said it was an emergency .
why would nayman ask you if you like sex and travel??
w w what is it supposed to mean?
that you fool around or something?
is that ...
i tell you the whole , long debacle and this you have a problem with?
yeah , i do .
i think that when you ask someone who is involved in a relationship of the heart if they like sex and travel , that ... that's m m mean spirited .
it's stupid .
i'll tell you this , we're not running any more , no .
no , no .
so done with the running .
the packing and the running and ...
sooner or later , that phone is gonna ring .
we are going to get your passport in order and you are gonna give the gun to margolese .
nayman is fucking margolese .
that has nothing to do with us .
by the grace of god , i don't know what , you have managed to forrest gump your way through this .
and just , if we run now ... we're gonna be running the rest of our lives .
we want our life back .
yes , baby , we do .
no , that can't be right .
can you just check again?
ow !
baby , don't .
margolese .
m as in mary .
baby , can you turn that down?
you don't even speak spanish .
real emotion transcends language , jerry .
you don't have to understand to hear their pain .
no , that's impossible .
that's ...
do you know when?
ay yi yi !
no , no , all right .
all right .
margolese is out .
he got out this morning .
he's out .
what's going on?
he's not due out till thursday .
it is thursday , hon .
what is it?
shh .
come on .
just stay away from the window .
shit .
shit .
here , give me it .
good one .
what is it , boy?
hey !
get out of there .
come on , man .
you're freaking me out .
huh?
ow .
where are you taking me?
it's not your fault you know nothing about this gun .
you're american .
this gun does not belong to you .
mr margolese .
well , i i ...
i don't understand .
what's it gonna take , jerry?
what?
for the gun , jerry .
what's it gonna take for you to give it to me and not to another?
you ...
man !
what'll it take?
i don't know what it takes .
i'm new in the " fuck you " business .
you tell me , what does it take?
i didn't fuck you , jerry .
i had nayman send you down here , but i didn't know he was looking for a buyer .
when i found out he was , i didn't know who on my team was ... still on my team , or even if there was a damn team .
who ...?
who the fuck are these guys?
they work for this man , tropillo .
and who the fuck is trop ...?
you know?
not important .
give me a good reason why i shouldn't fight to not give you the gun .
if it comes to that , someone will leave here missing an ear or not being able to fuck any more .
one reason , now that you let me know what you think i'm made of .
are you a fatalist , jerry?
uh , i never really thought about it .
por favor ...
gracias .
when you do think about it , about that afternoon you smashed into my life , into my car , ever think there's anything to that?
i honestly never thought about it .
because of that afternoon ,
i'm doomed to remember a backwards inmate with a paper clipping .
when you're in jail , a small box ... you learn a lot about the fella you're in a cage with .
i grew to love that boy , like he was my own son .
but he was his .
one day the boy came to me with a clipping .
this is my destiny .
this is my birthright .
it was a story about the pistol ... how they found it in the mines , stashed away .
when i asked why it meant so much to him , the story he told changed my life .
'the night before the nobleman's arrival ,
'the assistant could not sleep ... his heart in aching pain . '
'the day was here when the gunsmith would present
'his gift to the nobleman .
'the nobleman's son was a notoriously vicious soldier ,
'worldly and wicked .
'for him , his father demanded something more beautiful ,
'more perfect than he'd ever laid eyes on before .
'but nothing , no words or description could have given justice to it ...
'or have prepared him for that gun's flawless grace .
'when the nobleman's son saw his intended bride to be ...
'it was love at first sight .
'the nobleman's son took the mighty weapon into his hands .
'a perfect fit . '
'it did not work .
'the nobleman took it as a bad omen .
'the curse had rendered it useless in unworthy hands .
'the gunsmith urged him to try it one last time , and so he did . '
'the nobleman was insulted by the ineptness , angry with the gunsmith .
'they argued .
'when he realised that her heart belonged to the simple assistant ,
'a man far less than he , he was furious in anger .
'he could not have that .
'the assistant , realising that even if the gun should work ,
'she would certainly die next , begged his love to withdraw
'and accept their fate . '
'some say you could actually hear her heart break .
'she fearlessly surrendered her bitter spirit unto purgatory . '
'the pistol contains her damned soul . '
day after day i listened to that story and always he'd tell me ,
when i get out , i will find that pistol and return it to my father ,
whose father's father had crafted the gun .
eighteen months later , he took it in the belly for me .
he died .
i vowed to search , acquire the pistol and return it to his father .
my grandson , beck , headstrong boy ...
sure , he was mixed up , he didn't understand the honour behind what i was doing .
that's when it became clear i had to send you down here .
because you were the instrument in the situation , jerry .
his son is dead .
my grandson is dead .
all of it brought together by that afternoon at our intersection .
well , that ... that's a pretty good fucking reason .
usted es un soldado de dios .
you are a soldier of god .
she will be safe there , right there , and she can fly with the angels .
no devils can catch her here , right here , and now she will be able to fly with the angels .
we square?
i'll owe you .
jerry , honey?
'i bet this is the queen of the idiot?
'this must be sam .
this is bernie nayman .
'where's that stupid fucking jerry?
with leroy? '
don't you mean winston?
i hope not , cos he's dead .
'then you're in a lot of trouble .
'especially if jerry sold that gun . '
jerry hid it .
'a step in the right direction .
'are you there , sam? '
yeah , i'm here .
yeah , me too .
nayman !
what have you done with her?
sam?
don't shoot .
she's in the trunk .
i swear , if you hurt ...
it is hot in there .
let her out !
give me the pistol and i will .
all right .
all right , nayman , where are the keys?
i might have lost them .
well , you're out of luck .
she's the one who hid the pistol .
oh .
sam , no !
put it down .
you'll damage it .
shut the fuck up !
sam , do not , i repeat , do not pull that trigger .
no .
i ...
i will pull this fucking trigger .
you toast that gun , he's dead right after .
sweets .
put the gun down .
ok?
put it down .
i'm not worth it .
ok?
he's right , it's not worth it .
don't you know when enough is enough?
baby .
do you like sex and travel??
as a matter of fact , i do .
wrong answer .
sweetheart?
we just witnessed a miracle .
oh , my god .
