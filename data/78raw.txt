i'll call you in a week .
marcy doesn't want to meet you .
lnspector todd wants to see you now .

she doesn't like you .
she doesn't know me .
i described you to her .
why? !
i help you .
i tell todd you're working 24 hours a day .
look at that watch .
jeffrey , please , leave me alone !
i got to work undercover with you .

lf marcy won't give me her number , i'll give you mine , you pass it on .
i'm very close to shooting you .
as far as undercover goes , i want to be involved .
you want to work undercover?
when todd asks where i am , tell him i'm pursuing my credit card bust .
now you're undercover .
la times got a letter like that a few hours ago .
he knows that , billy .
ls this guy serious?
he's serious about the way he pulled the job .
he knew exactly how long to stay inside and what to take .
captain , i have this friend ...
why are you involved in this case?
i assigned you and taggart to the peterson extortion case .
bogomil , get your men in here .
come on .
you can't keep god waiting .
i don't want to hear that kind of talk .
he's fired every cop who worked for the old chief .
there's only us three left .
he's still head of this department .
yes , sir .
very smart , billy .
i have a relationship with this dude .
dude?
dude?
we're not even supposed to be working on this case .
come on , sarge .
i know you have domestic troubles , but you got to cool out , relax .
things like this work out .
trust me .
you moron .
you called the supervising agent of the goddamn fbl to help break this alphabet code?
this is a local crime .
my men will solve it locally , roseweed .
sir , my name's not roseweed ...
shut up , please .
and you , captain bogomil , this alphabet investigation was your baby .
did you call the fbl?
did you order rosewood to do that?
did you?
the captain didn't know about it .
i said shut up !
captain bogomil didn't call the fbl .
i did .
i said shut up .
i'm waiting on you , andrew .
did you order him to call the goddamn fbl or what?
no , sir , but that's beside the point .
no , that is exactly the point .
thank you .
you're history , kiddo .
you know very well that half of police work are cops following their hunches .
they go with their gut reaction .
i've encouraged this in my men and i'm standing behind rosewood .
good !
tell me something , andrew , how do you consider yourself a commanding officer?
you can't maintain a supervisory relationship with your own personnel .
and now you superseded the chain of command .
as of now , you are suspended .
what?
shut up !
on what grounds?
you have no control over your troop's activities .
you can't do this !
i can't do it?
i will not have this investigation pissed away .
this crime , this robbery , could be a political disaster for the mayor .
what about due process?
policy requires we give you a board of review within two days .
you got two days .
i am fighting you on this , harold .
chief lutz to you .
where are you going?
i'm not through with you two guys .
would you two like to hold onto your jobs a little while longer?
you report to traffic duty , effective immediately .
yes , sir .

yeah .

i don't know .
what do you make of this , andrew?
who the hell are you?
vinnie !

i'll tell you what's bad luck .
my friend's in a prison body shop .
he's a fucking clown .
i'm checking you for a wire .
lf he ain't a cop , why can't i frisk him?

why won't he let me frisk him?

i got 2, 000 blank american express cards .
right now .

i know you're getting upset .
you have reason to be , but i am close .
i am so close now and it's making me crazy .
i could smell it .
it's in the air .
do you smell it?
i smell it .
all i smell is bullshit .
i'm pouring money down a bottomless hole .
where are the bad guys at the end of this?
i thought if there was a problem ...

don't worry about it .
i'm on the job .
that's what i'm afraid of .
he's ok .
what are you doing here?
how's he doing?
lf he's strong enough to live through that , he's got a chance .
i got to see those letters .
they're at the station .
we can't take you there .
we're not supposed to be on that case .
it's a new ball game and we're not invited .
neither am i , but i got to see those letters .
it won't hurt to let him see them .

i think he's a nut case .
lutz is a nut case .
not lutz .
the alphabet bandit .
i don't think so .
he's too smart .
what else you got?
these shell casings are from the first robbery at adriano's .
these are . 44 auto mags .
they don't make these any more too expensive .
this is a casing from a . 308 rifle .
they cut it down to fit a . 44 .
they knew what they were doing .
shit .
put this stuff away .
who's this?
lutz .
all right .

covert .
billy and i have traffic duty , for christ's sake .
give me a break .
where'd you get that?
you stole evidence !
i only took one .

this is known as a clue .
few people know how to do this quality work .
we'll see who recognises it .
who are these guys?
this is your town .
you should know that .
there's a guy at the beverly hills shooting club .

i think there must be a mistake .
your company made a mistake .

you don't understand .
i know about every delivery here .
they put it in this little log .
we'll straighten this out with research .
this is a sound seeking projectile .
i suggest no telephones .
don't cough .
lf you break wind , make it a quiet one .
the slightest peep and your designer jeans won't fit no more .
y'all handle this after i go .
excuse me .
i just realised , you could do me a favour and drop this off at mr fielding's office .
let me explain something .
my friend bootsie got killed doing this .
i ain't carrying this cos you made a mistake .
i carry from a to b.
i have a wife and two kids .
i'd like to see my daughters again .
it's on your way out .
it's no problem .
lf you just drop it off at mr fielding's .
what about my daughters?
what's in it for my family?
what do you want?
what's in it for me?
i have beautiful daughters .
you're asking me to risk my life .
what will i get?
$10?
i have twin daughters ... with pigtails .
would you take that off my desk and drop it off at mr fielding's?
that's all i have .
please take it .
i'm sorry , that's it .
where's his office?
along the corridor , down the steps .
on your way out .
the name's on the office .
just over there .
i'm just doing this for my kids .
this is how bootsie got killed .
all they found was $20 and a pair of adidas .
along the corridor .
down the stairs .
we almost got fucked up .
thank you .
shoe money for my daughters . $5 a shoe .
that's four shoes .
she knew you were hard to live with when she married you .
it's her fault for thinking you'd change .
thanks .
i admire her for having courage to leave you in search of a better life .
i'm sorry .
i was trying to make you feel better .

take a break from cheering me up .
keep the grip tight .

all right?
excuse me .
are you russ fielding , gunsmith?
yeah .
have you ever seen this before?
it's a . 308 rifle shell cut to fit the . 44 .
where'd you get it?
christmas gift .
charles bronson is a friend of the family .
he gave me this for christmas .
i'm karla fry , assistant manager .
how are you?
beautiful place you have here .
my name's richard james .
very nice to meet you .
russ , could i see you for a minute?
be right back .
take your time , russ .
goddamn , that's a big bitch .
who is that man?
i don't know .
he's got a . 44 auto mag casing from here .
i saw .
you sure it's ours?
i made a whole bunch for mr cain .
did you tell him that?
no .
don't .
keep him there while i check him out .
i think we have a problem .
fielding made that casing for cain .
you wanted to see me?
i'd like to go over plan c and d.
we've promised to deliver thomopolis $10 million , friday at 6pm .
lf we fail , i'll be put to some inconvenience , to say the least .
so i'd like to go over it and avoid the mistakes made on the adriano job .
what mistakes?
adriano's was perfect .
adriano's was not perfect .
it was perfectly planned , but it was executed with incompetence .
it was partly my fault .
i assumed if my instructions were clear , even you could follow them .
obviously , i was wrong .
i don't understand .
you supplied your thugs with guns from my club?
yes .
but they were totally clean .
nobody could trace them .
nobody knows you planned the jobs .
nobody knows you wrote the notes ,
karla did the job and left the notes .
then why is there a man in my club with shell casings from one of my guns asking questions?
i don't know .
who is he?
i'd say he's a cop .
wouldn't you?
i don't know .
i haven't seen him .
here he is , on television .
take a good look at him cos you're going to kill him .
what?
kill him , burn him , blow him away .
how long would it take to shave those legs?
i suppose you're trying to be charming .
just offering my grooming services .
i don't think so .
chip , perfect timing for once .
chip cain .
i'm the manager here .
how are you , chip?
beautiful place here , very comfortable .
we do our best .
maybe you'd like to have a guest membership .
that'd be nice , kinda like shooting guns in the house .
where can i send you an application?
1603 hillcrest .
a big white house .
beautiful place .
we'll send it along with the . 44 shells .
i'll be sure to duck .
goodbye , mr james .
i guess that's my cue .
excuse me .
you got a match?
damn .
richard james .
1603 hillcrest road .
right .
hey , cain ... you got a match?
here you go .
keep it .
and , jack , don't screw this up .
what about the cop in hospital?
he's guarded 24 hours a day .
here's the impending alphabet note .
will they break this one?
they'll crack it when we want them to .
how'd it go?
what would you guys say if i said a six foot blonde works here?
witnesses reported a six foot blonde at adriano's .
this isn't detroit .
six foot blonde women grow on trees in california .
he's right .
they're everywhere .
you really need me !
you can't tell there's something weird here?
meet me at my house at 1603 hillcrest in about an hour .
where are my vitamins?
here's $20 .
get some more .
my house in an hour .
what did he do , sell them?
freeze .
damn it , axel .
you scared the hell out of me .
sorry .
i let myself in .
how you doing?
i'm tired .
i had some work to do at the office .
you still at the insurance company?
find anything?
a lot of newspaper cut outs about oil prices dropping .
did you invest in oil stocks?
on a cop's pay?
no way .
and there's an ad for a club called 385 north .
ls that one of your father's hangouts?
your father got shot cos he was on to something .
but what?
do me a favour , use your connections at your company to find out about a guy named maxwell dent .
i'll try .
you can let yourself out .
i'm gonna take a shower .
don't shoot nobody .
this has got to be a mistake .
there's his car .
lf he's here , he must be robbing the place .
i don't like this , billy .
what would he be doing here?
maybe the pointer sisters live here .
what? !
out back .
welcome to wheel of fortune .
i thought i just heard jack say ...
watch out .
the deck's very slippery .
there's beer in the refrigerator or you can make yourself martinis .
wait .
you're on duty .
no martinis .
perrier water is what you want .
swimming trunks in the bedroom .
dive in the pool .
why are you in a place like this?
a place like what?
like this .
swimming pool , jacuzzi .
what?
i'm spoiling myself rotten .
the construction?
i am embarrassed about that .
i'm just using the other five bedrooms , compromising my lifestyle .
you've stolen it .
how can you steal a house?
it's my uncle's house .
ls he in rock 'n 'roll?
no !
look at the big titties .
look at this , titties , orange juice , beer ...
will you put your trunks on and get in this pool?
i want you out of this pool and house in seven minutes .
you're still a police officer .
you'll get us all in deep shit .
i love when you talk dirty .
get in this pool .
get out of the goddamn pool !
i told you the deck was slippery .
taggart !
what's taking you so long?
what do you think?
sharp?
go right in , mr president .
have fun .
excuse me .
who are you?
and who are those people?
i'm his representative .
that's former president gerald ford there .
it doesn't look like gerald ford .
have you seen him without make up?
probably not .
this is what he looks like now , the ex president .
he couldn't get out when he was running the country .
now he's a civilian , it's his right to shake his ass .
he says , " i wanna go 385 north , " and i said , " let's go .
we came to party .
you should be proud to have him here .
it's our pleasure .
thank you very much .
excuse me .
can i have a coke with no ice?
one coke , no ice , coming up .
there you go .
who's the popular blond?
that's nik thomopolis .
he owns this place .
that's seven bucks , buddy .
for a coke?
i can get blown for $7 .
things are getting pretty crazy .
we're in deep with axel again .
we'll be directing traffic the rest of our lives anyway .
the hell with it .
