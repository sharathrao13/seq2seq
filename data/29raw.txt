fok yuen kap was a chinese kung fu master who defeated a russian strong man and a bushido master from japan .
fok became a living legend .
unfortunately , this hero was defeated by treachery and died from poisoning .
there were many rumours about the manner of his demise .
this film is based on some of the most persistant of them .
i'm too late .
i'm sure you came as fast as you could .
where is everybody?
they've all gone to the funeral .
please give me an umbrella .
teacher !
teacher chen !
teacher ...
teacher's beyond hearing .
chen !
teacher
teacher
what's the matter with you?
take him back .
let him rest .
have some porridge !
you haven't eaten in two days .
teacher's dead .
i know how you feel .
but it still hurts me to see you mourn like this .
please , eat something .
he still refused to eat?
talk to him .
why won't you eat?
we all feel sad over teacher's death .
but we have to go on living?
i don't believe it .
can jaundice really kill a man so fast?
he had jaundice , but he died of pneumonia .
can that kill a man like him?
you tell me .
how did he die?
the doctor said ... he died of pneumonia .
i don't believe it .
he was in pertect health .
how did he die?
something must have happened .
calm yourself .
we've all been thinking about it .
lf we respect teacher's ways , we mustn't be rash .
we are investigating quietly .
i must find out the truth .
of course .
it's our duty , too .
many people will come to ... pay homage tomorrow .
you must be calm .
get some rest .
fok yuen kap was a great martial arts instructor .
he was a champion of the weak .
everyone who knew him already knows that .
i , myself , knew him for 30 years .
i admire him for ... founding the cheng mo mun school .
he travelled all over the country , using up all his money and energy .
ln the end , he even sacrificed his life .
i remember what he used to say .
his purpose in founding cheng mo mun , the doorway to martial excellence , was to strengthen the mind and body .
he didn't aim to defeat other fighters .
he was opposed to conflict among the different schools .
he hoped that all of us ... would be of one heart ... to be strong , and love the country .
i think ... we must remember his words ... and develop chinese martial arts accordingly , so that every chinese ... will be strong . to serve the community and their country , as well as the future generations .
fok yuen kap died too soon .
cheng mo mun is still so young .
he contributed so much to martial arts .
we have lost a great man .
out of respects to master fok ,
let us have 3 minutes 'silence .
please sign your name .
we're just in time .
you're ...?
i'm the interpreter for the hung kiu school , mr. wu .
i've brought something for you .
what is it?
our chief instructor , hiroshi suzuki , sent me .
'sick men of asia '
what do you mean by that?
it's very simple .
we know you're training here .
this nameboard is a gift from our master .
are you chinese?
yes , but i'm different from you .
calm down .
i wouldn't dare come here if i was afraid of you .
i knew you'd all be here .
we came to challenge you .
well?
who'll step out?
chia chi .
stand back !
my friends here are eager for a duel .
who will satisfy them?
you have trained hard ... but now you dare not speak out .
what's happened to your courage?
hold it .
you're ...?
i'm wu , the interpreter .
our teacher told us . to train for physical fitness , not for fighting .
our school won't fight with you .
then you're conceding defeat .
lf anyone can defeat me ,
i'll eat those words .
listen to my japanese friends .
they've made a bet .
well?
anyone care to try?
lf the cheng mo mun people won't fight . how about the other schools?
well?
you want to ...
don't get mad , kid .
you are all useless sick men of asia .
chen jun , control yourself .
why don't you speak up?
you can all attack together .
we'll be happy to oblige .
let's go !
it's an outrage !
lsn't it outrageous?
why won't you let us fight?
i wanted to fight too .
but teacher told us not to get in trouble .
who do you want?
hiroshi suzuki , isn't he your chief?
well he ain't here .
what is it?
i have something to return to him .
you've really got some nerve .
i'm the worst of the cheng mo mun students .
i really want to try out japanese martial arts .
so you want to find out how good you are?
well you must be tired of living !
well?
do we fight alone or all together?
it'll just take me to show you ...
stand aside !
surround him !
hold it !
now you listen to me .
i'll only say it once .
we are not sick men .
eat it .
this time you're eating paper .
the next time , it's gonna be glass .
what is it?
are you mad?
stop that !
a cheng mo mun student dares to cause trouble here !
what's his name?
master , he's chen jun , ho's favorite .
let me ask you this .
can we followers of bushido ... take this lying down?
never !
japanese bushido is the world's best .
now tell me what we have to do .
we must take revenge !
right , revenge !
okay .
smash the cheng mo mun school .
don't come back if you fail .
yes , master .
let's go !
what do you want?
i want to pass no , no , no .
not allowed , i'm afraid .
and that?
look , you're the wrong colour , so beat it .
come here !
you were wanting to get in here?
no , no , no .
crawl like a dog and i'll take you in .
hurry , the police are coming !
what do you want?
you dare to attack our school?
what's behind this?
why do you have to use violence like this?
stop !
don't insult our teacher's memory .
stop !
right , let's go !
that's only a little warning .
hand over chen in three days ... or we'll have you closed down ... and you'll all be arrested , too !
brother !
come here and help !
teacher , if you had been alive we wouldn't have been bullied like this .
he wants us to hand over chen .
lts chen's rashness that got us into trouble .
don't blame him .
no , don't blame it on him .
he's back .
what's the matter?
you got us all into trouble .
where have you been all day?
did you go to hung kiu school?
you wanted to be a hero .
look what happened to us .
why did't you tell us what you were going to do?
listen .
we strengthen our bodies ... to protect our beloved country ,
but not to go out fighting and making trouble .
when you went out to challenge them , why didn't you tell us?
many japanese came ... and beat us .
they asked us to hand you over in three days .
what shall we do?
let him finish what he started .
how can you say that?
what then?
wait to be closed down?
not only that , we'll all be arrested .
think !
we can't give chen over to them , and we must protect our school , too .
we can't surrender him . or he'll be killed for sure .
there's only one way .
leave shanghai .
right .
you must leave shanghai .
never .
why not?
i don't want to get you into trouble .
we all understand .
you must think for yourself , too .
i'm not leaving .
you must leave .
lf they can't find you , then even the japanese influence is powerless .
they can't do anything without proof .
i didn't mean what i just said .
we're brothers .
i can't let you die .
you're not willing to leave .
do you think staying is such a brave thing?
none of us is afraid of trouble .
why do you disregard good advice?
go , we won't blame you .
go , we won't blame you ...
have you forgotten .
what teacher always said?
you know the principles of our school ...
his death increases our burden .
think of the school ... if not yourself .
why sacrifice needlessly .
as your elder , i order you to go .
you're leaving tomorrow .
buy him a train ticket for tomorrow .
it's late , you'd better sleep .
ls everything packed?
yes .
i came back to marry you .
but look what's happened .
i don't care much for ceremony .
we can return to shanghai some other day , in happier times .
my friends suffer because of me .
nobody is blaming you .
it's the first train in the morning .
get some sleep .
i must stay with teacher tonight .
you go to sleep first .
did anyone see you?
no .
they're all asleep .
got it?
yes .
mr. wu told us to get away .
lf they found out ...
fok died of this . we'd be in deep shit .
why does mr. wu want us to leave?
he said the job's done .
there's no point hanging around .
what should we do now?
you return home tomorrow .
i'll resign , and we'll go together .
so you're japanese?
yes ,
i came to kill fok yuen kap .
how can you say that?
why not?
i'm not afraid of your so called 'fist of fury '.
you're fok's favorite pupil .
i must test your mettle .
feng wai sher , come out !
feng wai sher , come out !
why did you kill teacher?
why?
why?
why?
why?
why did you kill teacher?
teacher was killed by poison in the biscuit .
i'll go find the real murderer and take revenge .
captain !
captain !
captain !
captain !
what's the matter?
where's the captain?
two of them ... hung on a pole .
i saw it myself .
they're out there .
what is it?
i just bought my train ticket .
i saw two men hung on a lamppost .
lts feng and the cook , tien .
are you sure?
yes ,
feng and the cook .
there's absolutely no mistake .
let's go and have a look .
what is it?
feng and tien are dead .
it is feng !
it is ...
let's go back and talk things through .
get transportation .
yes .
the two men's faces were all cut up .
it seemed that they'd fought before they died .
who could it be?
will cheng mo mun be blamed?
no , since we don't know who did it .
we can't be sure what happened ,
but they still belonged to our school .
so what?
we didn't kill them .
this is the lnternational settlement .
i see troubles ahead .
we must find the killer .
so , who did it?
chen did it .
chen?
was it really him?
he left a note for me , saying that
teacher died fro poisoning .
i wonder where he could have gone .
hiding doesn't help .
he always acts as he pleases .
why didn't he tell us?
we must find him .
but shanghai is such a huge city .
where can we find him?
he does not know shanghai that well .
organize a search !
we must find him .
we'll settle this when he returns .
who is it?
