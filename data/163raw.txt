no , you're not fired .
but i can't put you undercover anymore .
that's over .
what do they expect me to do?
to do your job .
i work undercover .
that's my job .
you have a new job now .
and what is that?
sitting on a wire , stakeouts , log tapes .
a little public relations .
fourteen years on the job , and that's all it means?
i've gotta sit on a wire with some rookie listening to a housewife order groceries?
all you had to do was keep your mouth shut .
all i did was tell the truth .
act like you belong on the same team as the rest of us .
what team?
that bunch of suits sitting behind a desk trying to justify their existence?
like me .
is that what you're saying?
i don't know , joe .
why didn't you say one thing to back me up?
because you were wrong !
i wasn't wrong !
you were dead wrong .
two teenage kids in cold blood , and you know it .
they were goddamn bank robbers , for christ's sake !
they were kids .
will you forget about south dakota?
forget who's right and who's wrong .
this is one of the best undercover guys .
how could i forget that?
sit down , art .
sometimes ... you got somethin '.
it's ... magic .
then it goes away .
you had it .
but the magic's gone .
they told you to break my balls , and see if you could get me to quit .
i'm not gonna make it easy for you .
you want me to sit on a wire , i'll do it .
you want me to chase file applicants , i'll do that .
take your best shot .
check your mailbox for your new assignments .
hey , simon , we're here .
mommy , simon is home .

sip it slowly .
daddy'll be home soon .
and when you finish that , you can wait for him up in your room .
congratulations .
you've reached the puzzle center .
for solving one of our master puzzles , you've won a subscription to the magazine of your choice .
can i please have your name , address and telephone number?
you are ... a stranger .
excuse me .
this the puzzle center .
where did you get this number?
puzzle nine nine .
what did you just say?
who is this?
simon , put down the phone .
simon , simon , wait a second .
please don't hang [ dial tone ]
come on , come on .

see if they correlate .
if they don't , you may have lost some bytes in the transfer , lost a keyword .
you won't be able to defractionate .
yeah?
are you scrambled?
give me a break , leo .
i'm busy .
it's mercury , dean .
somebody just walked on water .
you have to get up here now .
what did you just say?
you are a stranger .
who is this?
simon , put down the phone .
simon , simon , wait a second .
please don't hang
who is that?
listen to the timbre of his voice .
it's a child .
that had to be his mother .
right .
it's just some rug rat ... drooling over the phone , punching numbers , like a random thing .
huh?
we're not that lucky .
we have to call kudrow .
what?
dean , what?
no , no , no .
we don't have to call anybody .
all we gotta do is an analysis , and give him a report when he gets back .
that's it !
do you understand what just happened?
we have to call him now or he's gonna say we tried to hide it .
morning , sir .
good morning , marine .
i've got an urgent message for lieutenant colonel kudrow .
mercury is already operational in most of our com centers .
and i'm here to confirm everything you've already heard .
mercury is a quantum leap in our communications security .
and once we complete its installation in all of our com centers ,
it's going to be very hard for our adversaries  and our allies .
and our allies to compromise our communications .
an urgent message for you , sir .
if you'll excuse me .
mr. johnson will continue the briefing .
all right , gentlemen .
lmpossible .
you're late .
i wasn't when i started .
traffic was like mud .
i oozed home .
i told simon he could wait up for you .
simon , my man .
i wonder where simon is .
time for bed , simon .
send in pedranski and crandell , please .
yes , sir .
who needs a fix?
double tall , double dark , double sweet .
double everything .
i'm so glad i missed the whole drug thing ... so my body was virgin territory for caffeine .
it makes me feel so ricki lake , like i can talk to anybody .
what can i say?
i'm the java queen .
what's wrong?
kudrow wants to see me .
cool !
maybe you'll get your own section .
no .
i , uh , i screwed up .
well , just go in there and throw him a bart simpson .
kudrow , dude , chill out .
it was that way when i got there .
doh !
puzzle line?
puzzle line?
now , i've traveled 10, 000 miles in the past 24 hours .
so i've had a lot of time to reflect on this .
correct me if i'm wrong .
but i believe neither one of you has ever said the words " puzzle line " to me .
before mercury went operational , we ran a standard validation protocol .
the works .
double sets of paired cray supercomputers , fricking velociraptor machines chewing at mercury 24 hours a day .
mercury came out unbent .
awesome , sir .
it was finally a code that couldn't be broken .
but there was one last thing to check out .
the , um ... geek factor .
human beings will fool you sometimes .
we thought it important
we slipped a message in one of those egghead word games .
we dared amateurs to crack it .
we were sure nobody would ever call .
but somebody did .
his name is simon lynch .
he lives in chicago .
he is nine years old .
and he has deciphered a message written in the most sophisticated code ... the world has ever known ... in a geek's puzzle magazine .
i don't recall ever authorizing ... [ shouting ]
anyone to put any message ... into any magazine !
that couldn't just happen .
a kid couldn't just pop it open .
not only is he nine years old , he is handicapped .
he is autistic .
y es , that explains it .
so our $2 billion code is an open book ...
to people of diminished capacity?
no , sir .
autism isn't synonymous with diminished capacity .
autistic people are they're shut off .
but it's not unusual for an autistic person to be a savant .
oh , a savant !
he may not be able to actually decipher the code .
it might just appear to him .
right .
he didn't calculate anything .
he just saw it .
like those stupid pictures at the mall .
you stare at them .
all of a sudden you're looking at the statue of liberty .
exactly .
this is not a stupid picture at the mall .
this is national security .
looking at the best case scenario , let's suppose the boy is unique ... and he doesn't understand what he's just done .
does that solve my problem?
answer :: no !
all we need now is for someone else ... who understands his capability to come along , and my problems are increased exponentially .
then maybe we should talk to the kid .
and , uh  no .
no : no .
there must be nothing that connects the boy to this office .
nothing .
am i clear?
y es , sir .
i want you to erase the tape .
am i clear?
y es , sir .
honey , will you get that?
y eah , i got it .
martin lynch?
y eah .
detective burrell , chicago police .
sorry to bother you .
can i ask you a few questions?
it's very important .
i got your address from simon's school .
something wrong?
if i drag this out , it's only gonna make things worse .
one of the other parents has made accusations ... against simon's driver of a sexual nature .
oh , my god .
well , they're only allegations at this point .
if i could step inside and speak with you .
uh , sure .
it won't take more than a moment .
i don't want to upset you .
well , you've already upset us .
i'm sorry about that .
would you like a cup of coffee?
or something?
yeah .
yeah , that'd be real nice .
911 .
emergency operator 562 .

emergency operator 562 .
what are you reporting?
i have your location on my screen .
can you tell me what you're reporting?
anything while i was gone , art?
yeah , i think we got a big break in this case .
what?
the attorney general herself just called in 25 dimes on the cubs .
what do you think?
uh  [ phone rings ]
y eah?
this is 13 .
cubs ten times .
got it .
dumb bet , 13 .
cubs are in a slump .
would you mind if i told you something personal?
y eah , i would , roger .
i really would .
excuse me .
y eah?
art , for you .
yeah?
we're sending someone to spell you .
we've got another assignment for you .
lomax has another matter of national security for me?
check into a possible missing child , 2 1 precinct .
chicago p. d. retains jurisdiction .
y eah .
lacerations .
nichols .
you still alive?
still here , art .
how are ya?
all right .
what is this?
it's supposed to be a missing kid .
it is .
these are the parents .
looks like a murder suicide .
so where's the kid?
missing , remember?
what are you doin 'here?
somebody called the f. b. l . and they sent me .
go figure .
no , i meant , what are you doin 'here?
workin 'my way to the bottom , jack , just like you .
the kid's name is simon .
neighbors say he's retarded .
guys who kill their families kill all of 'em .
maybe he did the kid somewhere else .
didn't want mom to see .
kid like that costs a bundle .
maybe dad got tired of knocking himself out for a kid who didn't know better .
put 'em all out of their misery .
how's a guy that's so broke afford a $1500 handgun?
mind if i take a look around , jack?
we already did .
the kid's not here .
does that mean you mind?
hey , be my guest .
thanks .
by the way , lomax called .
he said it's important .
y eah , i bet .
got a phone on you?
what do you know?
thanks .
be sure i get it back .
how are ya?
good .
how ya doin ', champ?
you okay in there?
come on .
you can come on out now .
nobody's gonna hurt you .
i'm not gonna hurt ya .
okay?
come on .
come on .
no , no , no , no !
simon !
all right .
quiet !
quiet !
call concordia .
get an ambulance over here .
have some badges waiting for us when we get there .
for what?
i want this kid protected .
how am i gonna justify the overtime?
since when you worry about overtime , jack?
the coroner says murder suicide , they can go .
anybody asks about the overtime , put it on lomax's gold card .
straps are just makin 'him worse .
they're for his own safety .
unstrap him .
they're for his own safety .
all right .
simon , we're gonna unstrap you .
take it easy .
simon , just calm down .
all right?
mommy !
daddy !
mommy !
daddy !
tell him to turn that off !
turn the siren off !
simon , ho .
hey !
now look .
who's this?
is that your mommy right there?
is that your mommy?
mommy !
mommy !
right there?
yes , that's right .
your mommy .
that's her .
is that your daddy?
daddy .
right .
do not touch .
it may be hot .
that's very good advice .
is that your teacher?
dr. london?
she's your friend , right?
my name is art .
i'm your friend too .
art is a stranger !
art is a stranger !
art is a stranger !
okay , strap him in .
i won't hurt you .
hi .
are you the doctor?
um , no , i'm the nurse .
is a doctor gonna see this boy?
uh , i took care of him .
is that the best you could do for him , just give him a shot?
he's autistic .
autistic?
uh huh .
what does that mean?
nothing gets through?
no , it's just the opposite .
everything gets through .
he has trouble with feelings and emotions .
so he gets very frightened and confused .
wait .
i'm not gonna be able to question this boy?
probably not .
sorry .
take care of him .
why are we doing this , dean?
why does he want to see us?
we didn't do anything wrong , right?
should i turn around?
no , he'd kill us .
he might kill us anyway .
are you being serious?
relax , leo , please .
okay , i'm scared .
i'm gettin 'really , really scared .
leo , stop it .
we're doing this together .
we didn't break any laws .
no matter what he says or does , we're gonna do the right thing .
so just relax .
jesus !
okay .
can we go home now , please?
yeah , all right .
it's him .
let's just get this over with .
okay .
this changes everything .
now somebody else knows .
oh , god .
what happened to the boy?
he's alive .
he's being held in a lockdown unit in a chicago hospital .
why don't we tell somebody?
because we are somebody , leo .
we're the ones that are ultimately responsible for this .
there isn't anybody to tell .
so i want you to keep the puzzle line open 24 hours a day .
and i want you two to do your goddamn fuckin 'jobs !
quiet !
maybe i'm goin 'about this the wrong way .
my wife says my people skills are like my cooking skills .
quick and tasteless .
but in the end , it's about saving lives .
lsn't that the point?
y es?
y es .
i know a man named rasheed halabi , born in paramus , new jersey .
valedictorian of his high school class , worked his way through m. l . t.
right now he's a colonel in saddam's republican guard .
we put him there .
it's him this code is protecting .
there are thousands of other men and women just like him ... whose identities are protected by this code .
we can save their lives .
i give you my pledge .
i want you to give me yours .
diligence , loyalty and above all ... absolute silence .
this is kind of an interesting story .

what the hell happened to you?
you kidnapped this kid from the hospital?
are you crazy?
what are you talking about?
lomax has been calling me every 15 minutes .
there's a warrant out for your arrest .
i killed a guy on the c. t. a.
oh , christ !
i had to .
he was trying to kill us .
how did this happen?
somebody pulled the cops off the kid at the hospital .
it's not a murder suicide .
the mom and dad got in the way .
they're trying to get the kid .
if he hadn't hidden , they'd have got him too .
i cannot handle this paranoid conspiracy crap .
it is a conspiracy .
who pulled the cops off the kid?
did dead martin and jenny say " take my kid out of protective custody "?
this is real !
i don't give a fuck if it's real .
if i don't call lomax right now , i'm an accessory to this .
if you don't get on the phone now , call concordia or c. t. a. , you're a dumb cop .
tell them to bring a body bag to put the pieces in .

why don't we go in the kitchen
t. j. , why don't we go in the kitchen and make something to eat , and maybe simon will come with us?
here you go , art .
it's still damp , but at least it's clean .

you're welcome .
simon , i think these will fit you .
not my frank thomas shirt !
remember what i told you about sharing?
i thought you were done taking those downers .
y eah .
so?
there's no body on the el tracks .
what?
no body : no blood .
no casing : nothing .
who could've got it cleaned up that fast?
give him up .
what?
the kid .
give him up .
take him back .
would you give your own kid up?
it's not your kid !
yeah?
well , right now , he's nobody's kid .
his mom and dad got shot dead by a real bad guy .
remember?
let's go , simon .
let me get these clothes on him .
i need your car keys .
let me just walk around the streets with this kid now?

12 : 00 .
the wrigley building .
good boy .
i'm gonna start to take this personally if you don't
hello?
hello?
oh !
oh , i'm sorry , sorry .
are you okay?
i'm fine , really .
i'm sorry .
it was my fault .
i should've watched where i was going .
no , i shouldn't have had it there .
the way my day's going , i'm lucky you didn't trip and sue me .
what do you got in there?
plumbing supplies?
look , this is gonna sound crazy , but i have a little problem ... and i was wondering if you could help me out .
you see that little boy sitting over there?
do you think you could watch him for a couple of minutes?
you didn't just accidentally trip over the case , did you?
he's autistic .
and i'm his big brother .
not his real big brother , you know?
big brothers of america .
it's going really well , but i need to get a prescription filled for him .
normally i'd take him with me , but i don't like to disturb him when he's sitting so calmly .
you don't have to do anything .
just sit here and be your lovely self .
please .
okay , yeah .
what's his name?
simon .
you sure this is okay?
y eah .
if i can handle a district manager , i can handle anyone .
thank you .
i will be right back .
oh !
what's your name?
stacey .
stacey  sebring .
stacey , thank you so much .
i'll be right back .
i promise .
would have done it without the flattery?
hey , simon . # # [ reggae ]
just keep walking .
keep walking .
jeffries?
just keep walking .
i wasn't sure you'd be here .
simon's read the code twice .
that's really incredible .
also very dangerous .
who do you work for?
the c. l . a.?
no .
the defense department?
i'm afraid you're not that lucky .
i think the f. b. l . likes to call us " no such agency .
why does the n. s. a. want a 9 year old autistic boy?
the brain is still a mystery .
what?
the reagan administration mandated the national security agency ... to generate a new code to protect american informants working for foreign governments .
we developed a super code at huge expense .
named it mercury .
we thought it was impenetrable .
you're telling me a kid cracked a government super code?
it doesn't matter .
he can read it .
he might even be able to recreate it .
that's why his life is in danger .
n. s. a. is willing to have this boy killed to protect a code?
we may have already tried .
i think my division chief may have given orders
i'm a cryptographer , a nerd .
i don't know what these people do .
maybe it's routine killing kids , or maybe my boss is an aberration .
call an ambulance !
get an ambulance !
move it !
move it !
get out of the way !
move it !
excuse me .
watch out !
watch out !
get out of the way !
watch out !
watch out !
move it !
goddamn it , move !
move !

f. b. l .

through the door to the right .
thank you .
hi .
special agent jeffries with the f. b. l .
can i help you?
i hope so .
where's the tape for this camera?
um , here it is .
no , um ... look , it's my ass if you take that .
then don't tell anyone .
thank you .
damn it .
excuse me , excuse me please .
excuse me .
whoa !
hey !

sorry .
what happened?
he almost got away .
you didn't tell me i have to watch him every second .
sorry .
i shouldn't have left the coffee shop .
no !
no !
all right , all right .
don't scream , don't scream .
all right .
oh , my god .
he doesn't see things like other people do .
where did you just go?
rob a bank or something?
i gotta get him out of here .
let's go , simon .
thank you , stacey .
thanks for all your help .
come on .
# # [ music box ]
my dad will kill for this .
how much?
one hundred .
get real .
hey !
have you ever thought , what are we gonna collect when we get old?
plaid shirts and kramer dolls?
what's the matter?
dean is dead .
he's been shot .
what?
he wanted to go to chicago .
i said , " don't go .
he wanted me to go with him and help him .
someone shot him?
who would shoot him?
i can't tell you .
leo , i want to help you , but you have to let me in .
tell me what's going on .
he'll find out .
who?
you mean kudrow?
i don't have the capabilities to e mail over his head .
i can't use the phone because everything gets recorded .
everything is connected to everything .
there is nothing i can do .
low tech rules .
congratulations .
as of this morning , you made it to the very top of our own perp board .
i don't have to tell you how profoundly pissed lomax is .
he's keeping a lid on it to cover his ass , but you don't have much time .
yeah .
did you find out who the shooter is?
whatever happened to , " good morning .
how are you?
sorry about your car .
it got impounded .
you won't be able to get it for two weeks .
did you get in trouble?
no .
i told them you stole it .
found him in the defense department data banks .
his name is peter burrell , special forces .
so , let's bring him in .
can't .
unless you want to dig him up .
he's dead .
he's listed as killed in beirut in 1982 .
you still think i'm paranoid?
i don't know , man .
who knows?
but if you are , then i guess i'm paranoid too .
we're in over our heads .
we can't fuck with the n. s. a. so?
we find somebody to talk to about this .
lomax?
he's a company man .
the n. s. a. could've gotten to him too .
fine .
i'll go above lomax .
i don't want you to do anything else .
you got a wife and kid to take care of .
go do that .
really .
all right then .
what are you gonna do?
i don't know .
why are you doing this , art?
that kid isn't your responsibility .
whose responsibility is he?
look at him .
he looks like a regular kid , right?
one little circuit gets crossed .
zap !
he should've been smart , go to college , meet a girl , get married , have some kids , be cool .
are we talking about him , art , or are we talking about you?
thanks for getting this together for me .
be careful .
yeah .
jesus !
who the fuck are you?
oh .
oh .
please .
please [ gunshot ]
okay !
oh .
you .
what do you want?
it's 2 : 00 in the morning , and you don't know me this well .
i need to talk to you .
you're gonna wake up my neighbors .
oh , man .
we need a place to stay .
how'd you get this address?
i looked it up .
no , it's not listed .
the name of your company was on the side of your sample case .
i called them .
right .
call my company , ask 'em for my address , they give it to you?
nope .
please .
stacey .
i'm an f. b. l . agent .
yeah .
i bought one of those for my little brother , $5 .
i saw you hiding from the police today .
i'll give them a call .
listen .
i really am an f. b. l agent .
please help us .
hello , simon .
hello .
please .
move your foot .
thank you .
thank you very much .
would it be stupid to ask why you don't call the f. b. l . for help?
the f. b. l . 's looking for me too .
oh , great .
so , how does this work?
you murder me now or you wait till i'm asleep?
simon needs to get a little sleep .
he's been up for a long time , and you seemed like a nice person .
come on , simon .
i'll show you where your bed is .
come on .
are you thirsty?
he gets the guest room .
you get the couch .
there's food in there .
the bathroom .
you can wash up after yourself .
let's take this off .
that's good .
now lie down .
okay?
let's take these off , all right?
one .
two .
okay .
that's good .
you okay?
good night , simon .
look ,
i have to be up in a few hours .
i have to fly to des moines in the morning .
if i don't make a sale there tomorrow , then i don't pay my rent .
so , unless there's anything else you need , i'd like to get some sleep now .
no , there's nothing else .
thank you .
i promise you we'll be out of here first thing in the morning .
leo , you won't believe the morning .
did i leave my
leo?
oh , my god !
tom , there's a woman downstairs asking to see art jeffries .
bring her up .
she won't talk to anyone except art .
do me a favor .
i haven't logged it in ... yet .
good .
how ya doin ', man?
anybody else with you?
no .
this is emily lang .
emily , why don't you have a seat?
go ahead .
are you art jeffries?
yeah , i'm art jeffries .
my boyfriend's last will and testament .
i worked with him at n. s. a.
the other voice on the line .
his name was leo .
he was gonna mail one letter to you .
the other was addressed to the senate oversight committee .
the letters are gone .
this is all that's left .
it has come to my attention ...
that my section director and immediate superior , nicholas kudrow ,
was directly involved in the deaths of martin and jenny lynch , " the parents of simon lynch , and the death of dean crandell , my colleague and friend .
they killed leo too right after he wrote that letter .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
thank you for coming down , emily .
i'm sorry about leo .
you said you were gonna be out before i went to des moines ... where hopefully i was gonna sell enough shoes to make the rent .
only i didn't go to des moines and i didn't make the rent because you had an emergency .
it was an emergency .
maybe you're one of those guys that has constant emergencies .
everything has to be about excitement .
there are guys like that .
y es , i know , but i don't happen to be one of them .
listen to me .
look at me !
this is not about me .
it's about that little boy .
and he needs some help .
as far as i can tell , you are a decent , caring person .
i promise you we will be out of your life as soon as possible .
okay?
look , if for some reason there is an emergency
oh !
you mean a different emergency !
yes , a different emergency .
do not call the police , okay?
you call this guy .
he's with the f. b. l .
i call the f. b. l . , not the police?
right .
the police can't protect simon .
right .
look .
simon is only in danger if they know where he is .
they don't know where he is , so he's not in danger , so you're not in danger .
all right?
right .
unless there's an emergency .
it's good to see you're keeping your sense of humor about this .
yeah .
i promise you i will be back in this apartment at 2 : 00 tomorrow afternoon .
and i don't know how yet , but i will make this up to you .
okay?
thank you .
take care .
i don't know if it qualifies as a plan .
i'm gonna fly there and show them leo's letter .
here's the bad news .
you gotta get simon into the witness protection program right away .
art , i'm not even supposed to be talking to you .
how do you expect me to authorize a move like that?
lie , cheat .
i don't give a shit .
you don't do it , that kid's as good as dead .
has it occurred to you that maybe kudrow would shoot you on sight?
y eah , that has occurred to me .
if that happens , you know what to do with these .
hope i see you later .
sandy !
so glad you could make it .
heard ted had back surgery .
did you have anything to do with that?
excuse me .
can i help you?
excuse me .
nick , my good friend !
i want you to know that your mercury thing is a goddamn triumph .
i mean that .
i appreciate that , senator .
a feather in your cap .
the oversight committee is singing your praises .
you're getting a reputation as the " can do " guy .
thank you .
i do appreciate that .
there's a guy outside .
who?
says he's with the bureau .
would you excuse me one moment , please?
if he wasn't bureau , i wouldn't have bothered you .
i would've lost him , but i didn't know , sir .
no , ted , you used good judgment .
i'd like to see him .
he's not very presentable .
bring him in the back way .
take him to the wine cellar .
i'll be down .
nick , i can't believe you look so good for someone so old !
how do you do that?
drugs , my dear .
massive doses of drugs .
please don't handle the wine , mr. jeffries .
yes , i've read your file .
a deeply troubled f. b. l . agent with a lousy record ... kidnaps a nine year old boy .
nice goin '.
you come to my home in the middle of a social function carrying a gun ... to confront me with this fabricated unsigned accusation , allegedly written by leo pedranski ... who was killed the day before yesterday by you , for all i know .
what do you want from me?
i'd like to get back to my guests .
unsigned accusation was typed on carbon paper .
who uses that anymore?
the late leo pedranski's fingerprints were all over it .
the pomerello's a little corky .
i'm sure the senate oversight committee won't have any problem connecting you to the murder .
but you haven't given the carbon to the senate oversight committee .
if you had , you wouldn't be here right now .
you've got your precious carbon tucked away ... guaranteeing your safety , etcetera , etcetera ... so you can come here and demand what?
untold millions in unmarked bills?
i asked you not to handle the wine , please .
you know , it's good to see you got your priorities in order .
that's better .
you're not worried about murdering a nine year old boy , but you're worried about this fucking wine?
here's the deal .
i don't give the senate oversight committee the carbon .
they don't waste three years with their investigation , wailing and moaning ,
how could this happen in america? " ... while you have one of your spooks whack simon lynch .
or?
or you do the only thing that'll guarantee simon lynch his safety .
you or one of your superiors or the president of the united states ,
i don't give a fuck who , but someone is gonna go on national television and tell america ... that your billion dollar , uncrackable code ... has been cracked by a nine year old autistic boy .
then you get your carbon back .
you know what i think , mr. jeffries?
i think you've seen too many of those four wheel drive commercials on tv .
the ones where you get to drive fast and be a renegade .
let's talk about the real world ... where you're not some wonderful lone wolf hero , but you're part of a team .
and you play your position because that's what america is .
it's one big team .
this might be difficult for you to grasp , but i am a patriot .
and a patriot is one who makes the right moral choice .
sometimes it takes a strong man to make that choice .
one boy who cannot survive on his own , one of nature's mistakes , weighed against the lives of thousands of our people .
think about it .
you worked undercover .
how many of our agents will be put in harm's way if this code is compromised?
members of your team .
men like rasheed halabi , an lraqi american and a great patriot .
a man , who as we speak , is undercover in saddam's republican guard .
a man who has not seen his family
that's for simon's parents , you piece of shit .
you got 36 hours .
should be enough time to get your undercover people out of harm's way .
oh , by the way .
happy birthday , nick .
hello?
hey , it's me .
y eah .
you all right?
y eah , i'm all right .
how'd it go with the witness protection thing?
everything's set .
tomorrow night , 8 :: 15 ,
u. s. marshalls are gonna meet us with a chopper ... at the heliport on top of the g. e. x. building .
i took your advice .
i lied .
all right .
good .
see you then .
bye .
that was recorded on passive v. o. x ... at agent jordan's residence at 11 : 58 p . m .
as to the pickup , since we can assume the boy will not be alone ,
i suggest we wait until we get him on the chopper .
saw them do this in the movies .
how are you , laddie boy?
oh , damn !
simon , turn it down , please !
hello?
hello?
hello?
how much i owe you?
twenty dollars , sir .
here .
thanks a lot .
stacey?
stacey?
shit !
hello?
tommy , where are they now?
hello?
tommy , where are they now?
relax .
simon and the girl are fine .
i talked to 'em .
she said she got spooked .
someone called .
when she picked up the phone the line was dead .
it was me from the airplane .
told 'em when witness protection is gonna pick 'em up?
absolutely .
she's gonna meet us there .
everything's set .
listen , i gotta go .
agent jordan .
lieutenant colonel kudrow of the n. s. a.
what am i looking at here , tommy?
you forged documents to obtain witness protection under false pretenses .
don't listen to anything this guy tells you .
this guy is dangerous .
tommy , sit down , and don't speak .
agent jordan , regardless of what you think of me ,
i only want to resolve this situation to rescue a young boy ... from a delusional kidnapper .
we will proceed with the pickup as planned .
as of this moment , the f. b. l . will stand down ... and the n. s. a. will take over from here .
gentlemen .
chief , take a look at this .
i'm not taking a look .
you have to look at this !
leo pedranski worked for kudrow .
he wrote that letter .
he was also killed after he wrote it .
i ran it through the lab .
and the fingerprints on it are an exact match for his .
up .
that's where we're goin ', simon .
come on .
is that you , art?
i'm a united states marshall with the witness protection program .
how do you do?
good .
you must be simon .
chopper on approach , sir .
why don't you come with me , son?
no !
he doesn't like to be touched by strangers .
i'll take him .
come on , simon .
let's go see the helicopter .
i thought art was supposed to meet us here .
there's been a change in plans .
but i want to assure you that your country owes you the greatest debt of gratitude .
chopper coming in !
don't have much time !
for the safety of the boy , you should go home now and forget you were here .
okay , simon , you're gonna go for a ride in the helicopter .
good bye , simon .
you can go with him .
tommy .
they're on the helipad , and the chopper's coming in .
you have a green light .
go , go , go , go !
it's a go .
let's move .
go , go !
hold them back !
stay down !
stay down !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
simon !
let me go .
come on !
no !
no !
no , simon , no !
get up .
get up , get up .
that's right .
tommy , no !
hold 'em back !
hold your fire !
keep 'em back now !
no !
where's the team leader?
right here , agent jeffries .
it's kudrow's piece .
i got a nine millimeter on the sidewalk .
i'll take care of it .
let's see what you got .
i want you to say " bug .
bug .
can you look at me?
bug .
bug .
that's very good .
i like that very much .
can i help you?
i'm art jeffries , a friend of simon lynch .
yes , i know .
his foster parents told me all about you .
how's he doing?
he's fine .
he's adjusted very well .
do you want to say hello?
he probably wouldn't remember me .
i was told ... not to expect too much .
i brought him some puzzles .
he likes puzzles .
do you think you could give these to him , please?
sure , but i think it would be better for simon if you did .
it's okay .
come on .
thank you .
hey , simon .
how you doin ', partner?
i brought you some new puzzles .
you might like those .
hey , simon , look at me .
look at me , simon .
look in my eyes .
look in my eyes .
it's me , art .
