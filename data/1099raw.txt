i'm calling with good news .
i'm calling from my very own phone ... from the comfort of my very own apartment .
you re what?
have you lost your mind , jones?
if there's anyone in this world who cannot take care of himself , it is you .
do you hear me?
no , you're right .
in fact , i've been interviewing help all week .
i'm leaning towards this beautiful asian girl .
cantonese .
cantonese , i mean .
she's expert in ancient massage techniques .

i knew it .
all those prep schools turned you into a little sex monster , didn't they?
i called to ask you something .
oh , god , here we go .
i'm going to need a copy of my birth certificate for school .
yeah , i bet .
well , have the school get in touch with me , then .
i have a right , blanche .
for christ sakes , jones ... couldn't we have a conversation ... ... where you didn't dredge all the footnotes of your ancestry?
what if i called your father a footnote?
just don't call him a manipulative son of a bitch .
i'd hate for us to agree on something .
i think my own father would like to know where i am , what i'm doing .
it's late .
you probably have school tomorrow .
jones?
don't you dare .
jones?
well , son of a ...
bitch .
i have done something to make you angry?
no , not you .
yes , indeed , mr. jones .
a happy bed makes for a happy home ... and mother here is going to show you just how happy a home can be .
my bed hasn't been delivered yet .

i'd have called first if i had that number .
yes , indeed , mr. jones .

are you sure that's clean?
your stalker has furniture .
you okay?
yeah , sure .
how are you?
great couch .
i'm settling into apartment life just fine .
i know it was more your stiletto move around a lot , place to place ... but i think i'll stay right here for now .
and why not?
it seems like every time i turn around , i make new friends .
jiminy .
let's get .
oh , i'm coming , i'm coming .
come on .
come on , baby .
no , no , darling , they ve waited long enough .
i ve waited .
oh , how i've waited for you .
each day a lifetime centuries longer than the day before it .
and it would've been ...
would've been ...
almost bearable .
and it would've been almost bearable ... if just once , you'd written a letter that you were still alive ... and that your love for me was still alive too .
how could i have known you lost both your arms in battle?
damn you .
haven't i told you never to speak of that?
you foolish , proud man .
don t you see it doesn't matter?
you can still touch me .
still a heart to love me .
still lips to kiss me .
you can touch me without arms ... and i need you to , darling , desperately .
please touch me .
touch me now .
touch me right now .
blah , blah , blah .
god , it's awful .
well , you're good .
really?
i mean , not just compared to you?
a glass , please?
oh , well , i don't have any yet .
sorry .
i find it awfully sad , really .
well , i'm going to get some .
no , not that .
you know , a person can pursue something .
a girl can go after her dreamland give it her ... energy , labor , sweat , tears ... and this is where it gets her .
a two room apartment and a role in some moronic period play .
things take time?
right , things take time .
i suppose , but i can't wait forever .
can i ask you something?
sure .
you can ask me anything .
who's the girl with the camera?
she's called 'jane . 'why?
well , she took my picture out here .
she didn't say a word , just took my picture and disappeared .
it was weird .
she is weird .
you know what?
i d be careful if i were you .
she took pictures of me once , and now she hates me .
hates you?
why?
i have no idea ... except i think she s maybe slightly insane .
insane?
hey , this is steve .
i m not here right now ...
hi , i'm jones .
i'm your neighbor from down the hall .
i think we're past that .
right .
i noticed you take pictures , and i can't seem to figure this out ... so i thought maybe you could ...
i don't know much about them .
is this one any good?
yeah , it's fine .
fine if you're going to disneyland with the wife and kids .
right .
well , i guess i'll have to plan a trip , then .
and a wedding .
here .
point and shoot .
right .
how did that picture come out , on the roof?
not so hot .
what did you say your name was?
i'm jane .
bye , jones .
ready?
beer?
no , no , this calls for wine .
i have a terrific bottle i've been saving .
you have a corkscrew , right?
damn .
here , let me .
it's a sticky one .
and that's how it started .
she opened the wine and started to pour ... and pour and pour , like words on a page ... big words like 'ambition 'and 'inspiration 'and 'passion '.
me?
i didn't say much , but she didn't mind .
she knew i was watching her .
i think she likes to be looked at , but i wanted to do more than look .
after all , i couldn't type , could i , if i didn't touch the keys?
and she was so close .
it should have been easy ... but somewhere , somehow , i think i missed something .
you know what i mean?
yeah .
you do?
no .
you don't?
i don't know .
i'm sorry .
it's late .
i m drunk .
i have to go .
morning , partner .
shouldn't i have handcuffs too?
sorry , partner .
i've only got one pair .
don't you think we should drink them first?
no .
you'd never hit them that way .
that's right .
steady .
use your sight .
line it up .
now , what are you going to do?
squeeze .
squeeze .
what are you not going to do?
pull .
beautiful .
whenever you're ready .
perfect .
you squeezed .
so , what do you think of lisa?
lisa?
yeah , upstairs lisa .
how do you mean?
well , you're seeing her , aren't you?
did she say something to you?
no .
i just know .
how?
it's an old house .
i know the creaks .
i know what goes on .
when she's in her bathroom brushing her teeth ... putting on a bit of eye makeup .
i hear her move from her apartment to yours .
you let her in .
she looks great .
she takes a seat on the couch , makes herself comfortable .
you offer her something to drink and excuse yourself to the kitchen .
'mineral water?
or i have a light beer . '
'mineral water , please .
in a glass , if you don't mind? '
mineral water?
oh , come on .
it's not like i'm snooping , really .
i just hear it .
there's a lot of turnover upstairs .
everybody leaves a story behind .
now , i could tell those stories , but i don't .
and i won't tell yours either , jones .
together this time .
six on the left are mine , right are yours .
i love what you're doing with the place .
thanks .
it's called acting .
right .
that , that ...
thing?
that thing is a product of ...
product of ...
hello?
hello?
i can hear you breathing .
jane?
listen to me , you pathetic bastard .
how did you know it was me?
you think you're cute , don't you?
oh , for christ sakes , jones .
you cook a meal for a man just once .
he thinks he can call you on the phone .
what he thinks is that he's got god given right to tell me ... what to do , where to go , and what time to be there .
maybe he wants to show youth world .
istanbul .
mozambique .
what are you talking about?
you know what i'm talking about .
my father .
you said he'd been everywhere , seen everything .
that he'd written it all down .
every sight , every sound .
so that he could show you the world .
i never told you that .
he told me that .
i remember more than you think i do .
i'm getting dressed here , jones .
what did you do , blanche?
what did you do that was so bade left both of us?
if you gave school half the energy you give this little genealogy project ...
i bet they'd name building after you .
i am taking it seriously .
in fact , there's an instructor here now .
oh , instructor , hell .
what instructor?
it's art class .
we're doing nudes this week .
but she said i could sketch some gin bottles for extra credit .
i'll send you one .
how i ve waited for you .
each day a lifetime centuries longer than the day before it .
and it would've been almost bearable ... if just once , you'd written me that you were alive ... and that still loved me too .
damn you .
i thought i told you never to speak of that .
never .
i know you got it , you chicken shit .
you can still touch me .
still a heart to love me .
still lips to kiss me .
you can touch me without arms ... and i need you to , darling , desperately .
please touch me .
touch me right now .
at least someone's been rehearsing .
it was bad , wasn't it?
you can tell me .
you were good .
can you say that again , please , with just a little bit more feeling?
you were good .
will you kiss me?
okay because you want to , or okay because i asked you to?
i want to .
will you do it now , please?
okay , i will , but ...
sorry .
i'm not very good at this .
oh , but you will be .
you will be .
what are you waiting for?
this isn't your first time , is it?
what?
are you serious?
jones , my god .
what do you think this is?
nothing .
i mean .
god , exactly .
you know what?
you can't do this with me .
not like this .
i mean ...
you're really sweet and everything , but my god ... how old are you anyway?
seventeen .
seventeen?
my god , what am i doing?
you know what , jones?
you need to fall in love first .
love?
yes , love .
seventeen year olds can fall in love .
by the time i was 17 , i'd already loved three or four boys .
like really , truly , loved them .
you're right .
of course i'm right .
trust me .
you don't want to do this .
you're right .
you think you do , but ...
what did you say?
i said , you're right .
right about what?
about this , about us .
i don't want to , like you said .
what?
okay , the show's over .
i m through being an audience .
just looking on and listening .
i want someone who's more than words ... because if i ve learned anything , it's this : talk is cheap , partner .
so you say it's a party you want?
hell , i'll show you a party .
what did i say about coming down and celebrating?
damn it , i got dishes at home that need washing .
you done crossed me for the last time .
speak up , damn it .
i'm talking to you .
oh , dear god , help me .
it's jones dillon , coming to kill me .
please , dillon .
i wasn't going to hurt her .
honest .
you'd best say goodbye to them buttons , you no arm son of a bitch .
mr. dillon .
you have a shave scheduled , mr. dillon .
a shave .
and a bath .
that's me .
but this animal said he was going to roll me down main street .
down main street , right out of town , one kick at a time .
squeeze .
with spurs on , jones .
i need a ride .
you didn't have to do this .
that's okay .
i've been meaning to buy some records .
we don't sell records .
i thought you said it was a record store .
it's just called a record store .
it s all cds .
right .
i don t have a record player anyway .
i don't care if you don t like the picture , okay?
what picture?
it's not going to hurt my feelings .
you could've at least acknowledged it .
what picture?
the picture i gave you .
the picture i slipped under your door .
i put it in an envelope and ...
look , there's no way you didn't ...
oh , goddamn it .
she likes you , right?
who?
who?
the bitch that ...
just forget it , forget it .
i m sorry .
are you coming in?
no .
i don't have a cd player either .
will you need a ride home?
no .
i'll manage .
how about you?
okay , shut it off .
that's great .
how do you know all this stuff?
i learned it from rocky .
who's rocky?
that motorcycle in my apartment?
that's rocky .
he left that behind , the rogue .
he was my last .
he lived in your apartment for a while , but he spent most of his time in mine .
then he moved on .
that was three years ago .
it's been three years since i had sex , jones .
didn't you say 'whoa '?
three years and you say 'whoa '?
three years of celibacy deserves more than 'whoa . '
'whoa 'doesn't come close .
try 17 .
what , years?
well , the first 12 were pretty easy .
but what about ...?
so you're a ...?
it's great .
it's really great .
it's the pain .
the pain?
that's why i like it .
because it's honest and it's real ... and it's nothing you can faker hide .
to me , it's like you're feeling pain for the first time in your life .
and before this moment , you didn't even know it existed .
i broke my arm once when i was a kid .
how is it someone you've just met , a person you hardly know ... can somehow know you?
can take one look at you ... and see more in that instant than most people will ever see?
i suppose there's only one way to find out .
hi , jane .
hi .
hi .
i was wondering if ... if you'd like to go out or ...?
you're a little young for me , jones .
besides , i don't date .
well , it wouldn't be a date .
i don't know many people here , and i thought maybe we could ...
maybe you should get a record player .
well , we don't have to .
i don't do movies .
no dinners , no picnics ... no walks .
how about you decide?
i hear you typing a lot .
what are you writing?
letters , mostly .
letters to whom , your girlfriend?
girlfriends .
there are several .
is that right?
get the fuck out of here .
superfecta is the big one .
the first four horses in order are bitch to win , but top dollar pay .
trifecta is the same deal , but first three horses in order .
still's a bitch , still good money .
exacta bet is firsthand second in order .
quinella is the same , but in any order .
so those are good .
win , place or show bets ... you can figure out for yourself .
are you talking to me?
yes , dummy .
how do you want to bet?
i have no idea .
how about you bet for me and i'll get us some drinks?
sure you will .
how did you do that?
a trick i learned from my mother .
so , what are we drinking to?
close your eyes and point .
new in town .
yes .
new in town , run , run , run .
baby , run .
yes .
go , go .
yes .
yes .
come on , come on .
little bee .
go on .
go .
little bee , run .
i used to go there a lot with steve ... and he always lost his ass .
i guess that s why i can still stand it there .
this is the part where you ask me who steve is .
no , it isn't .
fair enough .
then i'll ask you something .
name?
age?
seventeen .
from?
texas .
no funny accent .
i grew up in the east , mostly .
me too .
boarding schools and summer camps .
what about your parents?
what parents?
how many orphans got boarding schools?
lots .
who's steve?
i thought you didn't want to know .
he's your old boyfriend?
one of several .
are you telling me you're an orphan?
not exactly .
how many is several?
wouldn't you like to know?
i just want to know about one .
that's it .
out of film .
that's it?
why?
you thought you were getting somewhere?
so is there anything else i should know about you?
i don't think so .
unless ...
what?
no .
spill it .
i'm a virgin .
never?
all those girlfriends and no action?
i almost did once .
really , when?
recently .
how recently?
pretty recently .
i want to tell you something .
if you want to hang out with her , you don't hang out here , okay?
i'll hang out here .
okay .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry about the kiss .
so , what do you know about jane and steve?
can't do it .
sorry .
can't do what?
can't say .
it's one of those upstairs stories .
sorry .
but you know?
can't say .
but there's something to know , right?
is there?
damn .
partner .
she's at your door .
i didn't think you were home .
i'm not .
i wasn't .
but i am now .
now i am .
want to go for a ride?
in a half an hour?
blanche is in texas .
who?
blanche , my mother .
you asked me about my parents .
she lives alone .
drinks .
dates mostly men from the country club .
she ran my father off when i was 3 .
or 4 .
her story always changes .
what?
this is the part where you tell me about steve .
is that right?
i used to work in this shitty little bar .
steve came with his band , like ... they were playing a stadium show or something .
and for the next three nights , he sang every song for me .
i had never met anybody like him .
he said all the right things , did all the right things .
everything was so right .
then he fucked it all up .
me especially .
you seem okay to me .
i used to be better than okay .
new in town .
how are you?
how do i look?
you look great .
how's your arm?
i'll pull through , i think .
thank god .
i'm miserable , jones .
that must hurt pretty badly .
no .
i'm so bored .
right .
maybe you should get a record player .
shut up .
you know what i want?
i want you to write me a letter .
a letter?
yeah , those you write to girlfriends .
but just a 'letter 'letter , not a love letter .
i don't have any girlfriends .
i write them to someone else .
well , i'm someone else .
write one to me .
no , i mean ...
i don't send them .
it's complicated .
jones , i'm in the hospital .
i think i deserve at least a letter .
i knew that something like this was going to happen to you .
no , blanche , really , i'm fine .
i m going to pull through .
you see , jones , this is what happens .
i tell you things , and you don't listen .
you don't ever listen to me , do you?
well , you don't ever tell me what i want to hear .
don't you start .
this is about you .
this is about reality .
i'm going to have to hang up .
i ve got breakfast coming .
there's a place that delivers bagels and belly dancers .
it's fantastic .
are you drunk , jones?
what are you talking about?
here she is .
you can set that down anywhere .
how did he find out?
i called him .
you were bored , so you called .
wrong .
i missed him , and i wanted to call him , so i did .
didn't he fuck you up or something?
what's your problem , jones?
i thought we were friends .
he came 2000 miles , jones .
she can't help herself , jones .
it s a biological weakness ... for the black leather / guitar player type .
i've experienced bouts of it myself .
it's powerful stuff .
well , it's good .
really .
i'm happy for her .
she seems happy too , which is good .
it's great .
grab your hammer , partner .
did you see jane's car?
what happened to your arm?
you were with her .
well , i'm glad you're okay .
what about jane?
she's okay .
i'm glad .
when something like this happens ... it makes me wonder if i should tell her i'm sorry .
well , it was the deer's fault , mostly .
is that for me?
i write them to my father .
i don't send them , because don't know his address .
because i don't know if he's alive or dead .
nothing .
only you .
okay .
say it .
only me .
i'll be leaving soon .
i know .
i don't mean just from the hospital .
i know .
hey , guy .
oh , the famous copilot .
jones , right?
right .
yeah .
how's the arm?
you fucked her , didn't you?
what?
you?
but it was nothing .
nothing?
jane took pictures of her .
sexy stuff , where she was wrapped in these scarves ... and i wanted to find out what was under there .
but ... it was nothing .
and i mean , jane took it pretty hard .
jane takes everything pretty hard .
what am i telling you for?
you don't even have a cd player .
you'll be glad to know i'm recovering from the accident .
and that girl i told you about?
she's as good as new .
what i can't figure out is , how could i have been so stupid?
how?
you're listed .
that brad person downstairs , he told me which apartment , so ...
that brad person?
yeah .
do you know he made a pass at me?
wouldn't you know it?
you look nice , blanche .
then ask me to sit down .
well , thank you , mr. sophisticated .
i got a motorcycle .
well , isn't that nice .
maybe i should throw myself off this roof ... save the trouble of having to bury you .
i don't think the fall would kill you , but you could try it .
tell me about this jane person .
skip the part about her being lousy driver , though .
i don't know .
she's a lot like you , actually .
that's exactly what happens .
boys always chase after girls that remind them of their mothers .
she drinks , she's rude , and she s loud ...
yeah , okay .
shut up , will you?
is she pretty?
she's beautiful .
what about you , blanche?
are you making anyone miserable on a regular basis?
if that's your cute way of asking if i'm in love with anybody ... ... the answer is no .
come on , blanche .
well , sure , there might be times when i'm sweet on a man .
i like to feel good as much as the next girl .
but don't confuse feeling good with being in love , jones .
no , those two roads , they rarely cross .
rarely or never?
why are you still dragging around that beat up trunk?
that's all i have .
that and his typewriter .
well , why don't you see if you ve got a blanket in there for me .
i guess it's getting late .
we'll talk tomorrow .
tomorrow .
jones , watch the road .
it's beautiful .
you guys are unbelievable .
well , all i did was beat on it .
how would you like to drive it?
around the block , or 2000 miles one way?
i'll do it .
why would you do it?
we're friends , right?
yeah , we're friends .
poor guy .
he's crying .
crying , wow .
i'll only be gone for a couple of days .
shut up , jones , and drive .
right .
'i'm sorry , jones .
i don't have any answers .
not many anyway , and probably none that would make you very happy .
no one ever looked at me the way your father did .
he didn't see a pretty girl with a rich daddy . '
he saw someone with hopes and dreams of her own .
and i would have followed him anywhere .
well , we only got as far as a little cabin in a motor court .
i made eggs and toast in the kitchen , and we laughed , made love ... and drank whiskey .
i wasn't more than 50 miles from home , but it felt like 5000 .
and those two little rooms , they felt like the whole wide world to me .
but for him , i think it was just another dot on another map .
i'm sorry , jones .
i know i told you a lot of pretty things about your father ... things i wanted to believe too .
but the truth is , you never met your daddy .
one day he went out for cigarettes , and he never came back .
these letters of yours are hilarious .
i wish you'd let me show this one to steve .
where i'm tied up in the trunk and you come to my rescue .
i know what he did .
what who did?
i know what he did .
trying to get me drunk?
i tried to pretend it didn't happen ... that i didn't know , that i couldn't see it in his face .
but why?
why pretend?
because i didn't want to go back to the way it was before .
with steve , there's no yesterday , no tomorrow , just now .
always and forever now .
for the first time in my life , i knew what it felt like to be free .
let me try .
i could do it , jane .
i could rescue you .
you are so nice .
i could fuck lisa if nice is a problem for you .
we're too much alike .
i could see it in the photos i took .
i can see it now .
are you afraid of the dark?
i thought you'd want it .
you can switch it off .
this is not happening .
say it .
this is not happening .
you know , i've been some places .
texas .
delaware .
three schools in new hampshire .
kansas .
not everywhere , so maybe i'm wrong .
but i think you're probably the most beautiful woman in the world .
what did you say?
nothing .
you said something .
i said , we're here .
hey , guy .
i can't believe this piece of crap actually made it .
you can't do this .
don't .
what's that?
that stays .
right , the top secret funny stuff .
what was i thinking?
last night did happen .
please , jones .
what happened last night?
nothing .
nothing happened last night .
yes , it did , and it wasn't nothing .
it was something .
stop it .
this something i should know?
no .
yes , it is .
in your dreams , kid .
what are you doing , jones?
steve , stop it .
stop it .
get in the car , jones .
i want to talk to you .
why did you do that?
jane , what are you doing?
come on , open up .
you're better than this , jane .
you're better than okay .
come on .
give me a minute .
give me a minute .
last night was now , wasn't it?
there was no yesterday , no tomorrow , and it still is now .
it's not too late .
jones , it is tomorrow .
i'm here .
i cannot go back .
does it hurt?
i want you to take the car .
i don't want the car .
take it anyways .
you fixed her .
you put her back together .
somebody called the cops .
let's get the hell out of here .
yeah , let's go , man .
piece of shit car .
let's go .
let's go .
hello .
it was me , wasn't it , blanche?
all these years , i blamed you .
i thought it was your fault .
but it was me , always me .
jones , where are you?
why didn't you tell me the truth?
he left because you got pregnant .
because ...
oh , honey .
because i didn't want you to feel the way i did .
i thought i could at least do that for you .
what , so you could send me away to school?
and every summer .
no , that was your granddaddy's doing .
he said that i'd never make for any kind of a mother ... and i should just take care of it .
you were my chance , jones .
that he might come back .
i was your chance that he'd come back .
no .
i knew he wasn't coming back .
you can't stop some people , jones .
they come into your life destined to leave it .
you can wrap your arms tight around them .
the best that you can hope to do is just slow them down a little ... because there's no holding on tight enough .
but you were mine .
you were my chance , and i blew it .
no .
you didn't blow it , blanche .
jones .
guess what .
you're moving out .
guess why i'm moving out .
you got a part .
yes .
it's a musical on a cruise ship , so my stuff is going into storage ... and i'm going to sea .
what happened to your eye?
oh , it's nothing .
congratulations , lisa .
i left you something .
it's going to be worth something someday .
you want me to autograph it for you?
i'll just hold on to it .
hi .
oh , brother , where you been?
here , hit this , man .
check it out .
hey , what the fuck?
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
no talk , no rock , no rap , no crap .
nothing but today's best country , 24 hours a day .
wait a minute .
i know you .
what did i tell you , kid?
what did i tell you?
i think you dropped this .
this is a new shirt .
this is a new shirt .
don't ever change that hair , okay?
what the hell did you do to my car?
sorry about that .
liar .
what happened to your motorbike?
she just quit on me .
nothing lasts forever .
right .
do you still think i'm the most beautiful woman in the world?
shut up and drive .
