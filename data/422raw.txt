who's there?
<i>i said , " who's there? " </ i>
oi , sir !
<i>sir? </ i>
<i>ah , dear , dear , dear . </ i>
sir?
i have it .
take me to her .
yes , master .
she's been waiting .
as have i.
hmm .
oh , van helsing , that last target was a civilian .
you know , one of those innocents ... you knights of the holy order are sworn to protect from the dark forces .
oh , i don't know , carl .
i thought i detected ... a hint of demonic influence in its beady little eyes .
<i>beady?
van helsing . </ i>
carl .
cardinaljinette .
you are needed .
<i>next tableau . </ i>
and there , the second victim .
next tableau .
victim three , what they could find of her .
and again .
<i>the latest victim . </ i>
those women died at the hands of a monster .
but from eyewitness accounts , one who was once a man .
keep in mind that this man's soul can still be saved .
not every soul deserves to be .
van helsing , since time immemorial , <i>the knights of the holy order have served and sacrificed ... </ i> <i>as humanity's protectors from an evil so ancient ... </ i> all have forgotten it but we few .
that monster showed no mercy to those women .
to remain true to our calling , we must believe all souls are worthy of salvation .
stop him?
save him?
first someone's gotta find him .
and london's a city of almost four million people .
shouldn't be a problem , carl .
the murders were committed in the same small section of the city .
and all with a surgeon's scalpel .
now that suggests the murderer resides in the area and is involved in the study of medicine .
of course .
a scientist .
we see this all the time .
we do?
when their studies exhaust them , they're tempted to take the easy way out ... to find whatever it is they're looking for .
the unholy way , you mean .
using the dark arts to change from man to monster .
no doubt calling forth demonic familiars to serve him .
and would you have it any other way?
oh , this i like .
put her down !
happy to oblige .
<i>oopsie .
it's him , i tell ya . ! </ i>
<i>he's the killer . !
get him , lads . ! </ i>
tell the hangman mr. hyde says hello .
don't let him get away !
bloody hell !
he's gone .
like a blooming ghost .
perfect .
a monster that stops to wipe his feet .
clever , whoever you are , but not clever enough .
<i>mum , dr. jekyil has arrived . </ i>
he may enter .
<i>you're late this evening , doctor . </ i>
we grew concerned .
your majesty , you should know by now ... that nothing and no one shall ever keep me from you .
we are comforted by that .
we do look forward to your visits .
whatever medicinal miracle it is ... you conjure up from your concoctions , <i>we feel better and better after each of your visits . </ i>
as do i , your majesty .
<i>truly , we do not know ... </ i> <i>what we would do without you . </ i>
<i>oh , my . ! </ i>
everything is so ... twirly .
i'll take care of her now .
yes , master .
after you .
<i>careful , your majesty . </ i>
i wouldn't want you to fall .
to have you so close to me ,
i cannot help but recall the first time i gazed upon you ... so many years ago .
<i>you were the very flower of womanhood . </ i>
<i>newly on the throne . </ i>
<i>i was a mere youth . </ i>
<i>an impoverished student of the medical arts . </ i>
<i>and though i was just one of thousands in the crowd that day, </ i>
<i>i knew you saw me too and shared my love . </ i>
don't fret , my dear .
you'll soon remember everything as i do .
but i do remember ... something .
i'm ...
i'm the queen .
and you , my brilliant doctor , you've been treating me for that horrid illness that makes me feel as if ... as if i were a doddering old relic .
how better to prove the depth of my love for you .
now welcome , dear heart , to what will soon be our new home ... away from prying eyes , after our marriage , of course .
marriage?
but am i not still ill?
you shall have your medicine every night ... to keep you young and mine forever .
<i>could you stop squirming? </ i>
if you bought me the proper sized corset , i wouldn't have to squirm .
there .
a vision of loveliness .
i told the cardinal when he got your cable i am not a field man .
there's not much danger of you being mistaken for any kind of man , carl .
oh !
you put on too much powder .
and this lip rouge with this scarf?
no real lady would be caught dead with ...
perhaps not the best choice of words .
<i>carl , for a friar , you know an awful lot about lip rouge . </ i>
anything worth doing is worth doing well , even being demon bait .
well , it's not as if i could put an innocent life at risk .
<i>what about my innocent life? </ i>
if you truly believe this is beyond the scope of your calling ...
don't worry .
i know exactly what i'm doing .
that's what worries me .
<i>come on , ducky .
what do ya say?
let us buy you a pint . </ i>
oh , i don't know .
would you happen to be a gentleman of medicine?
if that's your fancy , girlie ,
i can play doctor with the best of'em .
physician , heal thyself .
men , they're all the same .
should we try another street corner?
van helsing , where are you hiding now?
it's about time you showed up .
sorry to keep you waiting , milady .
i am not a lady !
that's all right .
i'm not a gentleman .
you've only got one way out of this .
i know .
<i>you're no priest , man .
you don't miss much . </ i>
ah , the fetching lady friend .
stay there .
don't shoot !
i have no money !
i beg your pardon .
can you guess what happens next?
this is where you get off .
van helsing , how did you get here?
i , uh ...
i put on the brakes .
how did you get here?
well , according to the map , after 9 : 00 , the marelybone line ...
let's go see what's left of our friend , huh?
i don't understand .
how can i keep losing the trail of something so big?
and what's this?
it's my new invention .
<i>la santa pistola de agua . </ i>
the holy water pistol?
mm hmm .
i thought it might come in handy sometime .
it might .
it's as if the holy water made contact with something ...
unholy .
wherever he's going , he's following this sewer line .
we've reached the end of the line .
decaying flesh and sulfur .
this is his lair .
exactly how do you propose we cross that flaming moat of certain death?
the same way hyde must have .
those stepping stones .
i'll go first , shall i?
i could have been a franciscan , but , no !
i had to travel .
see the world .
well done .
carl , look out !
<i>elizabethan .
sixteenth century .
i know those uniforms . </ i>
<i> they're beefeaters .
of the dead ! </ i>
carl , in our line of work , there's dead ... and there's dead .
all right , that's settled .
they're really dead .
van helsing !
get up the stairs .
what?
<i>carl , the pistola . ! </ i>
of course .
that'll work .
that'll work .
van helsing , listen .
i'm truly sorry ... for calling you an arrogant , reckless popinjay .
you never called me an arrogant , reckless popinjay .
well , not to your face .
<i>dr .
jekyil , are you there? </ i>
who are you?
gabriel van helsing , miss .
and i'm ...
<i>you should not be here , mr. van helsing . </ i>
hmph .
well , don't mind me .
i'm not certain you should be here , miss .
very humorous , sir .
but you please me .
so you may address me as mum .
all right , mum .
who's dr. jekyil?
<i>my physician .
i've been very ill . </ i>
ill?
with what?
you look fine to me .
i'm ... not sure .
well , that's something we can talk about later .
right now , you have to leave this place .
<i> are you giving me an order?
pretty much . </ i>
sir , since it is obvious you do not recognize me ,
i am alexandrina victoria wettin , by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland , queen , defender of the faith .
queen victoria?
seriously?
<i>carl , meet queen victoria . </ i>
van helsing , queen victoria is a worthy matron of a certain age .
and this is an unholy lair where all manner of enchantment is possible .
whatever are you two speaking about?
we know we're looking for someone trained in medicine .
so why not consider the doctor who's been treating the queen?
the royal physician?
his name is dr. jekyil .
and we are to be married .
<i>when?
tonight . </ i>
and once we are wed , he can give me my medicine every night .
so i shan't ever be ill again .
it fits , carl !
a man of medicine in love with the queen ... driven to restore her youth looking for the easy way .
if dr. jekyil has concocted a potion that uses the life he stole from his victims to give youth to victoria ...
then if they marry , these murders will never stop .
i have no idea what you're prattling on about .
what murders?
why would i need someone to give me youth?
i'm only 20 years old !
your majesty , you're 70 .
<i>and you were married for ... for decades . </ i>
<i>you also have nine offspring , all grown, </ i> and more grandchildren than any man can count .
i think you and your friend should see a doctor of your own , or ...
<i>dr .
jekyil . ! </ i>
stand back , victoria .
i'll save you .
come , victoria .
where?
where we can be safe together .
i admit , i don't have much experience ,
but this is not going well , is it?
that way !
a dumbwaiter shaft?
how are we supposed to use it without someone up there to pull the rope?
fly?
good idea .
carl , grab hold !
of what?
that worked .
oh , maybe for you .
<i>please , doctor . !
you must explain . ! </ i>
oh , my goodness !
<i>this is buckingham palace and that's the golden jubilee balloon . </ i>
your majesty !
victoria , stop !
you're in danger !
wait , doctor !
they said the strangest things ... about you and me .
lies !
all lies !
into the basket with her .
cut the rope !
don't wait for me !
<i>we are carrying extra weight ! </ i>
<i>whoever that meddler is , i won't let him take you from me . ! </ i>
i won't !
doctor , what are you doing?
you're safe now .
why are you doing this?
for your ... love .
no !
he'll never take you !
not from me !
victoria .
forgive me , my love .
i have no other way to keep you with me .
stay behind me .
who are you?
what you fear most .
you had your chance .
i'm not here to kill you .
i'm here to save you .
too late .
good .
<i>no . ! </ i>
victoria !
ah , damn you !
van helsing , i can't !
just lie back , close your eyes and think of england .
well , that wasn't so bad .
i agree .
it was awful .
your majesty , as i understand such things , the light of day will lift the enchantment and restore you .
so i will bid you farewell .
but wait .
there's so much more ...
i mean , i ...
i must reward you .
that's really not necessary .
a vow of poverty and all that .
not all rewards must be material .
for your reward , you may kiss your queen ... on the royal cheek .
i would be honored , mum .
huh?
hmm .
psst !
<i>psst . ! </ i>
we are not amused !
<i>guards . !
oh , dear .
let's go , carl ! </ i>
guards !
guards !
you'll need to report to the cardinal in person .
what do i say?
this isn't over .
hyah !
