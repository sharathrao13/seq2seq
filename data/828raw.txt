i got nothing to say .
okay .
then we'll sit until you do .
i got a whole lot of work to catch up on .
we can sit here every day ... until the day i retire .

i didn't say anything .
i thought you said something .
ahem .
i was just clearing my throat .
okay .
maybe you're coming down with something .
ahem .
i'm all right .
it's just sort of ...
just what?
just ...
it's just a waste of time sitting here ... week after week ... wasting time .
i don't want you ... to waste your time , antwone .
so , what you want me to say?
it's not what i want you to say .
it's what you want to tell me .
maybe you can start by asking me a question .
i don't know .
get things going .
i can do that .
you said you come from under a rock .
what did you mean by that?
i don't know , i ...
it was the first thing to come to my mind .
what do you think it means?
well , it could mean ... that , uh ... that you feel under pressure ... that , uh ... uh , you feel a weight ... pressing down on you .
that you're in the dark , that you're alone .
you said you had no parents .
i had parents .
okay .
ahem .
only 3 sessions , right?
only 3 .
my father's name was edward .
so you knew him?
no .
i didn't even know his last name .
you know where he is?
yeah , i know where he is .
joey ...
he went to his ex girlfriend's house .
they got into an argument .
she killed my father .
where was your mother when this happened?
behind bars .
i see .
i was born in prison ... 2 months after my father was murdered .
why was she confined , your mother?
i don't know .
all i know is what i told you .
so you were turned over to the state?
yeah .
the state placed me in this orphanage .
it was supposed to be until ... my mother got out to claim me , but ...
she got out , but she never claimed me .
hmm .
how long were you there?
2 years .
how does that make you feel , antwone?
i don't know .
come on , you must have some feelings about it .
you know , you ...
what did it feel like?
rainy days .
rainy days?
okay .
why is that?
you know , in cleveland ... it rains .
not all the time ... but , uh , to a kid ... who wants to go out and play ... it seems like it rains every day .
but , uh ... kids expect it to rain sometimes ... but ... for one kid ... it rained too much .
hmm .
okay .
you want me to come back next week?
yes , i do .
you ever try to find her , your mother?
no , sir .
okay .
next week .
busy day?
uh , no more than usual .
hmm .
the tomatoes are from our garden .
yeah?
mmm .
they're so much better than last year .

i mean , i'm no green thumb or anything ... but ... heh heh .
who knows?
maybe i'm learning .
these tomatoes really are good .

when i was 2 ...
i was placed in the tate foster home .
reverend tate , he was a fire breathing preacher .
he had his own storefront church .
there was only a few members .
there was ms. tate , cousin nadine ... my foster brothers keith ...
keith was half white ...
dwight , and me .
# good god , yeah #
it was church 3 times on sunday ...
bible study on tuesday ...
y. p. w. w. meetings on thursday ... choir rehearsal on friday .
we found out if we caught the holy ghost ... in front of ms. tate ... she'd give us vanilla wafers after church .
so we'd catch it every sunday .
# hallelujah #
# hallelujah #
# hallelujah , hallelujah #
# hallelujah , hallelujah #
# good god #
# come on , church #
# show me #
reverend tate ... he didn't like dwight at all .
he said he had too much pride .
so he tried to beat it out of him .
sometimes , he would even try to beat him to death .
did he beat you?
no , sir .
i think he pitied me .
and i liked him for it ... but i was ashamed of him .
what about mrs. tate?
what about her?
i don't know which one of you no good rotten ... hardheaded niggers put your dirty hands on my walls ...
but i bet i'll get the right one .
i took you in ... when your no account mammies threw you away ... and this is the thanks i get?
tsk .
you ungrateful niggers .
hmph .
now i know i got the right one .
she used to brag about ... beating me unconscious .
hmph .
she'd threaten to do it again .
but she never did .
why do you think she never did?
uh ... maybe she was scared .
she found a new way to get me , though .
so you like fire , huh?
no , muh deah , no , muh deah ...
i don't like fire .
you ... stay ... away from things that don't belong to you .
you hear me?
you hear me? !
yes , yes , muh deah !
you hear me? !
yes !
dumb nigger .
i tried everything i could ... to get her to like me ... and nothing ever worked .
were you the youngest of the foster children?
no , dwight was the youngest .
i was in the middle , and keith was the oldest .
ms. tate , she used to put us against each other ... so much , we started hating each other .
but i think deep down inside ... we really hated ourselves .
what do you mean?
keith was half white .
she would try to compare keith ... to me and dwight .
you know , he had the good hair ... and we had the bad hair .
she used to say how keith was better than us ... because his father was white .
i wished i was keith .
mmhh .
but not even keith could escape ... from being called a nigger .
she hardly used our names .
she said the word nigger so often ... called us niggers so often ... that we could tell ... who she was talking to by ... the way she said the word nigger .
what happened to dwight and keith?
dwight is in lucasville state penitentiary .
keith got taken back by his mother .
he was raped by one of her boyfriends .
mmhh .
did what happen to keith happen to you?
hell , no .
okay .
okay .
was mrs. tate ever ...
was she ever nice to you?
yeah , there were times .
sometimes she would tell her friends that ... we were good kids and that she was proud of us .
chummy times .
chummy times?
yeah .
i got to where i could tell ... what kind of day it was gonna be ... by the scent in the air when i awoke .
how could you tell?
well , if i awoke and there was the smell ... of grits and eggs ... or water steaming off the pavement ... as she hosed it down ...
i had to look out all day .
but ... if i smelled pancakes ... everything was okay .
she make pancakes very often?
no , sir .
i can delay my next appointment ... if you want to talk some more .
no , sir .
hey , slim .
what?
you going home next leave?
hell , yeah .
i gotta tend to the flock .
hey , when i get leave ...
i'm gonna be like a ... a vampire ... coming to town with his coffin .
just a place to lay before i get down .
what's that mean?
man , shut up .
people trying to sleep .
aw , shut your grouchy ass up .
jesus !
hey , when you going home , pork chop?
when your mama quit tripping ... and send me my money .
ha ha ha !
what about you , fish?
when you going home?
fish?
fish !
last night ...
i had a dream about jesse .
who's jesse?
he was my best friend .
when i wasn't at home ...
i was probably wherever jesse was for 3 reasons .
one was , being his friend ... he wouldn't beat me up .
hey , jesse , look !
i got 5 !
and the other reasons were ... so he wouldn't beat me up .
i only got 3 .
i liked him a whole lot .
give me yours .
we used to drive our friend kenny crazy .
let's get kenny .
kenny hung around me ... for the same reasons i hung around jesse .
hey , kenny , let me see .
where's jesse?
ugh !
aah !
stop , stop !
get 'em off , get 'em off !
hey , kenny , what's wrong?
hey , kenny , don't forget to write !
hey , kenny , don't forget to write !
ms. tate , she hated jesse .
she hated seeing us together even more .
but for years , she couldn't keep us apart .
i was so happy when she kicked me out .
twonny .
that hoodlum nigger jesse call up here askin 'for you .
said something about y'all going to the picture show .
now , that's the devil's work ... and who told you you could go ... to the picture show , anyhow?
i mean , where you get the money , nigger?
did you steal it?
i already told you .
i've been raking lawns .
well , you woulda stole it .
give me the money .
i said gimme the money .
you don't know what to do with no money no how .
that's why i never let you have none .
why you always got to make things ... difficult for me?
difficult?
difficult .
where you learnin 'such fancy words at?
fancy?
ain't no fancy word .
don't sassy me , boy .
no one's sassing you .
don't sassy me !
ain't no one sassing you !
don't you ...
i ain't gonna let you beat me no more !
no more !
lord jesus .
i want you out of my house .
hmm?
and who you think gonna take you in , huh?
retarded nigger , don't nobody want you .
your damn mammy didn't even want you .
gimme my shoe .
hmpf !
must've felt pretty good ... when you took that shoe from her .
yeah , i felt like i was gonna go ... right upside her head ... but i just chilled .
why'd you chill?
i don't know .
well , i'm glad you did .
how'd you feel?
i felt like i won a prize ... but it scared me .
why?
it was the first time i ever felt ... more powerful than her .
it was like a surprise .
whatever happened to jesse?
we lost touch .
you know how it is .
yeah .
it might be helpful to understand the mentality ... of people like the tates .
here .
it's called the slave community .
why i gotta understand somebody beatin 'on me?
what you went through ... was in part the result of the treatment ... that slaves received from their masters ... and then passed on to their own children ... generation to generation to generation ... right on down to the tates .
sir , that sounds like an excuse .
i mean , i was a kid .
i understand .
you sound like you takin 'up for 'em .
i'm not saying what they did was right .
what they did was wrong .
we all have choices .
they made the wrong choices .
but this is not about them .
this is about you .
you were sent to me ... because you have an anger problem .
well , you got the right to be angry .
but you also have to learn to channel that anger ... to use it constructively .
instead of gettin 'into fights ... go to the gym .
hit the bag , lift the weights .
you have to use that energy to better yourself .
you say you're taking japanese classes , right?
yeah .
okay , you're already on the right track .
can we talk about this next week?
3 sessions , son .
unfortunately ... that's all i'm given to make a recommendation ... and i'm gonna recommend ... that you be given a second chance .
that is what you want , isn't it?
to stay in the navy?
yes , sir .
okay .
okay , stay out of trouble .
antwone !
antwone !

i know .
i told you i was good .
yes , you are .
you are good ... because you're honest .
you're more honest than most people ... even in your anger .
the only thing you're not honest with yourself ... about is your need to find your own family .
your natural family .
i don't feel like i need to look for them .
mmm .
it would answer a lot of questions for you .
i don't have any questions .
you're upset with them ... because you feel they didn't come to your rescue .
maybe they didn't know .
how could they not have known?
that's a question you need to ask them .
regard without ill will ... despite an offense .
that's webster's definition of forgiveness .
why do i have to forgive?
to free yourself ... so that you can get on with your life .
why i gotta go look for my family?

i've taken care of myself .
i have .
i've never been in trouble with the law .
i've read hundreds of books ... written poems ... painted pictures .
i've traveled the world .
i serve my country .
i speak 2 languages ... and i'm working on a third .
i never fathered any children .
i've never done drugs ... or even smoked a cigarette .
i used to dream about you .
my mother .
my mother .
you know , what you'd be like .
how you look .
your voice and your smile .
even your scent .
for all these years i wondered about you .
i dreamed about you .
didn't you miss me?
on the way to school each day ...
i imagined you were just around the next corner ... and when i'd get there , you'd be there .
and in my mind , you was always there .
you just couldn't find me .
so i'd race to the next corner ... and you'd be there .
i'd know you would .
then you would buy me ice cream .
and then you would take me home .
i'm a good person .
i'm a good man .
hey , boy , how you doin '?
i'm your uncle horace .
get out of the way , horace .

i'm your cousin eddie .
my dad named me after your father .

how you doin ', son?
i'm great , sir .
all right .
good .
good , good .
very good to see you .
so?
i took your advice .
i found my family and i found my mother .
good .
yeah .
so?
well , in my heart i forgive her ... but if i never saw her again ...
i understand .
it's funny to feel that way about your mother ... but i did it ... and i owe it to you to tell you that you were right .
you owe it to me?
yes , sir .
i needed to find her .
yeah .
well ... if i was right , it was for all the wrong reasons .
sir?
this stays between you and me , okay?
yes , sir .
my wife and i , we were gonna have a bunch of kids ... when we found out we couldn't have any .
and it rocked her to the core .
i knew what to do for her , though .
she needed help , treatment .
i made sure she had it .
the best psychiatrist , the one that trained me .
but i ... the well one , the strong one ...
at the same time i went about the business of shutting down .
very subtle , very quiet .
it was my little secret .
until one day , a young man came into my office and into my life ... and he blew up that little secret , right in my face .
and he put me to shame in a way i never thought possible .
because of you , antwone , i'm a better doctor ... and i'm learning to be a better husband .
you don't owe me anything .
i owe you .
you're the champ , son .
you've beaten everybody who was beating you .
i salute you .
you hungry , sailor?
i could eat , sir .
let's go .
