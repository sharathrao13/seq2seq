you're in luck .
you can't buy a stove like this easily nowadays .
it's almost impossible to find any hardware to sell .
i'll take that comb , and ...
do you have an umbrella?
an umbrella ...
oh yes !
it's raining , it's raining .
big brother's coming home with an umbrella just for me .
drip drop , plip plop .
down the rain comes !
that's got it !
be careful with that fire .
right ...
what are they up to?
they're doing their own cooking .
good for them !
more please .
mother , did you scold them again?
yes , but they refuse to apologize .
and that boy even bought a stove .
just to spite me !
finished !
bad manners , seita .
doesn't matter .
we can sit any way we want .
rice for two .
that's it?
next ration will be in july .
let me !
like it?
it's all different tastes !
grape , strawberry , melon , mint .
all in there .
drink it all .
all gone .
great ...
left the dishes for me to do .
so selfish ...
honestly !
those brats are two of the worst !
not again !
mama !
mama !
seita , my daughter and that man work for our nation !
we can't have her crying keep them awake .
we've enough trouble getting sleep with the air raids !
report from central military division .
several waves of enemy bombers are approaching .
going to the shelter again , seita?
you're old enough to help fight the fires , aren't you?
i want to go home .
i hate living with her !
we don't have a house to go back to .
with a great big streamer shaped like a carp ... ... and longer than a house .
the big one's the papa , the little ones the kids .
stop it !
don't you realize there's a war going on? !
you two are nothing but trouble for me !
a couple of pests , that's what you are !
you're no help at all during the raids .
you could just go and live in that shelter for all i care !
that's it .
we'll live here .
no one uses it .
it's sturdy .
we can live like we want !
can we really live here? !
we've bothered you long enough .
we're leaving now .
leaving ...?
for where?
haven't really decided yet .
well , take care of yourselves .
bye bye , setsuko !
this'll be the kitchen !
this'll be the front door !
where's the bathroom?
that can be anywhere .
wanna go somewhere with me?
thanks for the wagon .
just leave it there .
do you think you can sell us some food and straw?
i guess .
not much left , though .
my mouth's watering !
man , am i hungry .
well , we can always eat frogs .
frogs?
they're great .
you'd better get under the mosquito net .
what's wrong?
i forgot my toothbrush .
one night without it won't matter .
it's getting buggy .
you'd better get under the net .
it's dark in there .
i'm scared .
i have to take a leak .
how about you?
a kamikaze .
it looks like a firefly .
yeah ...
let's catch some .
okay , get in .
i can see you !
i can see you , too .
a hair clip .
okay , let's get as many as we can !
i went to a naval review , once .
before you were born .
naval review ...?
uh huh .
dad's cruiser , the " maya " , was in formation with the fleet .
mighty fortresses floating on the seas ...
defending our homeland from invaders near and far .
enemy plane !
i wonder where dad is fighting now ...
get off me , seita !
whatcha doing?
making a grave .
mama's in a grave too .
auntie told me .
she said mama died , and she's in a grave now .
we'll visit her grave sometime .
do you remember the graveyard , the one near nunobiki?
that's where she is .
under a big camphor tree ...
why do fireflies have to die so soon?
hey , it looks like somebody's living here .
probably lost their house .
maybe it's some crazy hermit .
it's a swing .
a kid lives here .
what's this?
rest in peace !
wish it was real food .
it says " setsuko " .
look !
dried frogs !
who'd wanna eat that? !
nobody i know would ever eat this stuff !
ground soybeans !
and i thought the food i got was bad !
a ghost !
i've traded everything for rice .
even my mom's kimono .
there's nothing left to trade .
please , i can pay you money for the rice ...
sorry .
i can't trade or sell anything to you .
i'm a farmer , but even i don't have any rice to share .
don't you have other relatives?
i can't contact them .
then take my advice and go back to that woman .
everything's rationed now .
you can't survive outside of the system .
just swallow your pride and apologize to her .
thanks anyway .
i'll ask someone else .
you're a navy man's son , right?
try to be brave .
should we?
uh oh !
it doesn't matter if you like it or not .
you have to eat !
you need to , so you can grow up !
seita ...
i i feel funny .
are you cold?
i've been having diarrhea ...
why you ... !
i'm sorry !
sir , forgive me !
i didn't mean to .
my sister's sick .
i just wanted to get her some sugar !
yeah , sure !
stealing food's a serious crime in wartime !
you god damned ... !
come back here !
what the hell ...? !
potatoes too? !
so you're the one who's been stealing around here !
seita !
i'm sorry !
i'll never do it again , i swear !
tell it to the cops !
i'll take you there myself !
now walk !
i hope they lock you up !
please , she's sick !
she needs me !
seita !
seita !
seita ...
the nature of the crime is fairly clear , i think .
thank you , i'll handle this .
you may go .
but officer ...
you've knocked this poor kid around enough .
i'm even tempted to call it ... assault !
i ... er ...
thank you officer !
they hit fukui tonight .
would you like a glass of water?
setsuko ...
seita !
seita ...
where does it hurt?
should i get a doctor?
setsuko !
seita , i have to go to the bathroom .
can it wait?
hop on .
brother's gone to the mountain to bring back some firewood ...
setsuko .
dinner .
this pumpkin's great .
tastes just like sweet bean jelly .
don't like that stuff .
look , if you don't eat , dad'll blame me for it .
come on , i'll even help you .
now cheer up and eat !
once you get better , i'll take you to the beach again .
now i'll really get you something good to eat , setsuko !
seita ...
seita ...
these were your mother's?
don't make me laugh !
don't try to pawn off this garbage on me !
setsuko ...
setsuko !
seita ...
water ...
breathe in .
and out .
she's been having diarrhea for a while now .
prickly heat ...
rashes ...
and salt water hurts her skin .
weakening from malnutrition .
probably due to the diarrhea .
next?
can you give her medicine?
a shot?
don't wanna shot .
please doctor , help her !
medicine ...
all this child needs is food .
food ...
what's wrong?
where do i get food? !
boy am i hungry .
what do you want to eat?
tempura ...
sashimi ...
jelly ...
anything else?
ice cream ...
and also ...
i want fruit drops ...
drops ...
okay !
i'll withdraw the money and buy you all the food you need .
don't want anything ...
you can have it ...
don't go !
stay with me !
don't leave me alone !
don't worry , setsuko .
i'll buy you some good , nourishing food .
and i'll never leave you again .
never , ever again .
i promise .
3000 yen .
there's a typhoon coming?
great , we get our " divine wind " after we surrender .
figures ...
surrender ...?
we've lost the war? !
haven't you heard?
japan's lost?
the great japanese empire?
yeah ...
surrendered unconditionally .
what about the fleet?
all gone .
sent to the bottom .
not one left afloat .
what? !
was my dad's ship sunk too? !
is that why he hasn't written? !
how should i know?
crazy kid ...
damn him !
i'm so hungry ...
dad ...
now dad's gone too ...
he's dead too ...
dad ...
sorry i'm so late .
i'll make you some rice .
up they go ...
and down again ...
oh ...
firefly's stopped ...
i bought us some chicken and eggs .
and also ...
setsuko , what's in your mouth? !
this is a marble .
it isn't a drop !
i brought you something i know you like .
seita ...
have one ...
setsuko ...
what's ...?
rice balls ...
i made them for you ...
here ...
have one ...
you don't want them ...?
setsuko !
look , it's a watermelon .
i didn't steal it , either .
here , eat it .
it's good ...
hold on , i'll make you some rice gruel with eggs .
i'll leave the melon here for you .
okay?
seita ...
thank you ...
she never woke up .
there .
charcoal for the cremation .
since it's a child , you should do it at a temple .
the body should be lightly dressed .
use beanstalks for a good fire .
beautiful day , in spite of it all .
it hasn't changed a bit .
it's good to be home !
look !
the old phonograph ...
i've missed this view .
come back soon !
the next morning , i put some of setsuko's ashes into ... ... the candy tin , and then climbed down the hill .
i never went back to the shelter .
seita ...
time for bed .
okay?
