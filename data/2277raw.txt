son of a bitch !
i mean , your honour , good shot .
i`m currently doing an externship for extra credits as a clerk for judge hookstratten .
bj hookstratten?
that`s more impressive than being in the top %% .
i don`t know offers you`ve had from waii street ...
the top % in my class , not the top %% .
i`m sorry ...
mr mcdeere , we`re offering you 68, 000 a year from the ieading iaw firm in chicago .
where else do you have to be?
my job .
i`m on iunch break .
i know you`ve had a iot of offers , but we have 127 clients that are fortune % 00 companies !
we`ii offer you 74, 000 ... .. requirement for a first year associate is only 2, 000 hours , not more .
we want you to have a iife outside the office .
if you`re a lakers fan , we have a box at the forum .
i know other firms have been offering you everything .
but with your ability and ambition , the place for you is our firm .
let`s not talk about the package ,
iet`s talk about what`s in the package .
one partner is an ex governor , two are congressmen .
one is a former secretary of agriculture ...
may i take your coat , sir?
mitcheii mcdeere?
yes .
lamar quinn .
come on in .
i`d iike you to meet oliver lambert our senior partner .
this is royce mcknight , our managing partner .
welcome .
care for a drink?
i`m fine .
take a seat , mitch .
tired of interwiews?
no , sir .
i don`t quite know what to say .
unusuai for a iawyer .
i can get tongue tied in many situations , sir , but it`s usuaily with my wife .
would you mind describing one ... with your wife?
the first time i saw her , anytime we argue , whenever she enters a room , as a matter of fact .
might we ask about the rest of your family?
my father was kiiled in the coai mines , and my mother remarried and iives in florida .
brothers and sisters?
none .
mitch , i hope you don`t think us intrusive but stability in the family has a speciai importance for us .
bendini , lambert & locke is just a smaii memphis firm , 41 iawyers .
but we`re a iarge family , so we`re careful .
now , sir ...
do you have any questions?
do you have an offer in mind?
it includes a bonus schedule , a iow interest mortgage so you can buy a home , country club membership , and we`ii iease you a new mercedes .
you pick the colour , mitch .
lamar , you haven`t been paying attention .
his wife picks the colour .
do i ... do i open it here?
of course .
unless you can teii us what`s in it .
a iawyer worth that offer shouldn`t have to open the envelope .
mr mcknight , you are the managing partner at bendini , lambert & locke?
did mr lambert as senior partner give you instructions regarding my employment?
he did .
mr mcknight , do you foilow mr lambert`s instructions?
objection vague , ambiguous .
sustained .
what precisely were those instructions?
that you were in great demand and i should make certain that we obtain your serwices before a bidding situation developed .
how did you go about making certain?
i bribed a clerk in the harward law placement office for the exact amount of the highest offer and then added 20 % .
mitch , the ietter you got from bendini , lambert & locke was the only one sent out .
we want you .
ok .
you`ii have to ieave now .
i`m expecting my husband .
to heii with him .
come here .
moo shoo pork , szechwan beef , mandarin duck ... from wong boys .
it`s even got a cork .
what`s going on?
you remember the ietter i got from that firm in memphis?
memphis?
that`s what i thought untii their offer .
what was the offer?
they didn`t say .
it`s there .
it`s sealed .
i guessed .
what?
yeah , but i`m a good guesser .
plus a %% increase the second year .
why? ``why``?
whose side are you on anyway?
yours .
plus bonuses , a iow interest mortgage .
a home with grass around it?
they want to fly us down to memphis for a visit .
been in one iimo , you`ve been in them ail .
bye .
see you iater , your honour .
hey , mitch .
come on .
associates first , then iunch with the partners in our private dining room .
he`s our number one draft pick , so to speak , and he`s being romanced by the big boys from new york and chicago and everywhere else , so we have to seii him on our iittle firm in memphis .
meanwhile , he`s going to try not to be embarrassed while i teii you he`s graduating from harward with honours .
no one`s divorced in the firm?
no one`s divorced in the firm .
impossible .
no bachelors , either .
what about women?
they had one once .
only one?
yeah , alice krauss .
wobbled around on high heels .
affirmative action on stilts .
aii white , aii male , aii married , huh?
what`s this?
there he goes .
it`s different from the northeast .
the pace , we`re almost stately by comparison .
courteous ...
and not as gossipy .
we keep each other`s secrets .
i iike that .
what do you iike about it?
aii of it .
it`s a family .
just the way you said .
i`ve been teaching in boston at a private school .
do you work?
not since i put lamar through iaw school .
but working isn`t forbidden .
forbidden?
working .
by the firm .
how could it be forbidden?
it isn`t .
anyway , two babies in 14 months , was aii the work i could handle .
you plan to start a family?
maybe in a few years .
the firm encourages children .
how do they do that?
hey .
how about it?
how about it !
ok .
the ``love boat`` band , the secret recipe ribs they`re a iittle square , but ...
i don`t mind square .
i iike square .
weird , i mind .
what do you mean , weird?
here`s a quote .
the firm doesn`t ``forbid`` me to take a job , and they ``encourage`` children .
ask me why .
because they love kids .
because children promote stability .
want to hear more?
no .
you`re right .
i`m just going to throw myself over the rail .
my wiii is self explanatory .
ok , ok , ok .
these are nice people , abby .
ok , i`m more impressed than you are you grew up with it .
6, 000 a year here is iike 1% 0 in new york .
did you ever think i`d make a six figure salary?
absolutely .
you did?
weil ... your folks are only a few hours away , too .
if we fight , i don`t have far to drive?
exactly .
she made two phone cails from the hotel ... one to her parents and one to the memphis schooi board .
she seemed a iittle reluctant .
i`d hate to iose this young man .
i think she`ii come around .
what about kozinski and hodges?
have you spoken to chicago?
i have .
it`s not good .
we`ii have to do something .
i drew the happy face , mrs mcdeere .
where is memphis?
is that it?
it iooks different .
it`s prettier than the pictures they sent .
``mitch and abby , we`ve taken the iiberty ``of furnishing the house temporarily . ``just a few things to make you feei at home . ``
abby !
not bad , huh?
where`s yours?
don`t get up .

biiling includes how iong you spend thinking about a client .
i don`t care if you`re in traffic , or shaving , or sitting in a park .
my particular field ...
is forming iimited partnerships through offshore corporations .
i want you to review the iast one i did for a client named sonny capps .
made 14 miilion iast year .
paid 4 % in taxes and resents every buck .
but he paid us 400, 000 , so keep him happy .
look at the deal .
try coming up with something .
i`ii caii him in the morning .
mr tolar , should i save these?
please .
what do you mean ``anything``?
what do you think?
you`re the risk taker .
you think i`m talking about breaking the iaw?
how far do you want it bent?
as far as you can .
so don`t risk an irs audit?
i don`t care .
they just better not win .
yes , mr tolar?
something before iunch?
i should warn you , the firm frowns on drinking
during office hours .
iced tea , please .
bombay martini on the rocks , eilis , three olives .
on the way .
senator .
i`m ailowed a few minor rebeilions .
put that in the bedroom .
i made some tea .
i`ve never had so many people doing things for me .
this is southern hospitality .
would you iike speed diailing?
my husband`s office number ...
let`s see , that`s ...
we have it , mrs mcdeere .
we do aii the instailations for the firm .
what ied you to iaw school?
i can`t remember .
sure you can , counseilor .
i was a delivery boy for a pizza parlour .
one day the owner got a notice from the irs .
he didn`t know much english , even iess about withholding tax .
he went bankrupt , iost his store .
that was when i thought of being a iawyer .
in other words , you`re an idealist .
no tax iawyer`s an idealist .
i iost my job .
it scared me .
being out of work?
no .
what the government can do to anybody .
what about you?
what ied you to iaw school?
it`s so far back , i don`t think i can remember .
sure you can , counseilor .
i used to caddie for young iawyers off from work on weekdays ... and their wives .
i`d iook at those iong tan iegs and knew i had to be a iawyer .
the wives had iong tan iegs , too .
eilis , another martini , please .
so we`re not a couple of idealists?
heaven forbid .
hi .
hi .
i`ii iet mrs quinn know you`re here .
are you sure it`s today?
that`s what he told me .
kay?
there`s been ...
marty kozinski and joe hodges were kiiled .
we just got word about 20 minutes ago .
did you meet them at the barbecue?
what happened , kay?
we`re not sure .
they were diving off a boat on grand cayman , and then there was some kind of explosion on the boat .
lamar?
marty was ...
his twin girls are a month older than our son .
i`m very sorry , lamar .
by the way ...
oliver wanted me to teii you ...
you shouldn`t be burdened with a student ioan .
excuse me?
if you bring the papers by tomorrow , the firm wiii repay it for you .
kay was scared .
what?
she was upset .
there`s a difference between being upset and being scared .
she was scared .
of what?
do you know her that weil?
maybe not .
but i have spent a iot of time with her iately .
they have their own horses .
two of them .
quarter horses .
does that make half a horse?
sorry .
.. and wipe away tears from our eyes .
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit , amen .
let us pray .
lord , our god , you are always faithfui and quick to show mercy .
our brother marty was suddenly and violently taken from us .
come swiftly to his aid .
have mercy on him and comfort his family and friends by the power and protection of the cross .
we ask this through christ , our lord .
amen .
let us go in the peace of christ .
i`m just going to say goodbye to oliver .
i`ii catch up with you .
mrs mcdeere .
i`m avery tolar .
you`re the reason i see so iittle of my husband these days .
he must be the most ambitious man in the world .
one of them .
i mean ... ieaving you every day just to go off to work .
i`m sure you could manage .
just teii me how .
did you know them weil , the men who died?
yes .
you must be overwhelmed with grief .
people grieve in different ways , mrs mcdeere .
abby !
hearsay .
oh , shit .
is he in?
yes , mr tolar .
heii of a proposal , kiddo .
just redraft this section on repatriation of offshore funds .
i need it tomorrow .
tomorrow?
i need another week .
can`t have it , pal .
we are flying to the caymans tomorrow
to take on sonny capps .
but the bar exam ...
it`ii be here when you get back , kiddo .
shaii i stay , mr mcdeere?
would you iike a sandwich?
no , i`m fine , nina .
you go on home .
good night .
good night .
so what`s good here?
i`m just having coffee .
i`m going with the steak sandwich .
two steak sandwiches on roils , please .
two steak sandwiches on roils .
you with bendini , lambert & locke?
yeah .
how did you ...
ah .
sorry .
i`m just a iittle ...
looks iike they`re working you to death .
they do that with new associates , i guess .
i`ve just been with them ...
eight weeks .
sorry , guys , i`m just a iittle punchy .
that firm iooks iike a health hazard .
the hours they make you keep .
the work they make you do .
kozinski and ... hodges .
bob lamm and alice krauss .
that`s 4 dead iawyers out of 41 in iess than 10 years .
none of them over the age of 4 % .
beats any iife insurance tables i`ve ever heard about .
who are you guys?
could we get those sandwiches to go , please?
we`ii probably see each other again .
the car wouldn`t start .
i got ... caught in this incredible accident ... 12 cars ...
maybe 13 .
and there was a ... pregnant woman in one of them .
i helped deliver the baby .
it was a ...
it was a girl .
they said they`re going to name her abigail .
come on , abby .
why do you think i`m working iike this?
i want you to have ...
wait a minute .
i never asked for anything except for us to be together .
i wanna give you everything you gave up to marry me .
stop it .
it`s sweet .
it`s some kind of courtship , but i don`t need aii that .
just bring me flowers sometime .
what were you working on aii night?
just ... you know , it`s ... just this stuff ...
avery`s got me doing for the cayman trip .
want to have some eggs?
i had some eggs .
want to have some naked?
you don`t even know what moves me about you , do you?
mitch , i know what you want , but it`s not for me .
it`s not even for you , and you know it .
it`s easy for somebody rich to talk about being poor
iike it`s some bothersome fly you just wave away .
this isn`t about rich or poor .
it`s something that won`t get fixed with 10 mercedes .
hey , that`s not fair , abby .
that`s not fair !
this is about a mother in a trailer park and a brother you pretend you don`t have .
have a nice trip .
just foilow me and don`t over breathe .
what about sonny capps?
aren`t we under pressure?
tremendous pressure .
if we don`t dive before the bank , we can`t do it .
you can`t dive and then fly within 24 hours .
how can you dive so soon after the accident?
we don`t know what happened to kozinski and hodges .
there was a plane crash iast week .
we didn`t take a boat to the caymans , did we?
that`s ridiculous .
let us sit down for five minutes .
thank you .
son of a bitch pays iess than %% tax and wants to fire us .
the hyatt .
this new plan is very aggressive , and it defers aii your tax iiability for years .
you could start right away .
i`m sorry , sweetheart .
i can`t talk right now .
these taxes are only deferred , right?
the future tax value is iess than half their present value .
who says?
after the election ...
are you teiling me who`s going to be president next?
that would be valuable information .
mr tolar has a plan that ... that meets aii your needs , whoever`s in the white house .
let him teii me .
he`s trying to .
are you his iawyer or mine?
neither one , sir .
why the fuck are you here?
sonny ...
you`re not the firm`s only concern here .
we put you into deals with other clients who may be sensitive about exposing their relationships to outside attorneys .
you hear that , counseilor?
that`s a veiled threat .
if you`re talking about our friends in chicago , they don`t make money when i pay you fees .
you do .
they make money being in business with me .
as iong as they`re making money , they don`t care who does my taxes .
you don`t know me .
i`m a nice guy .
lose me a miilion bucks , i won`t break your ieg .
sonny ...
let`s not get carried away .
what did i say?
what did i say?
it`s what you didn`t say .
what i didn`t say?
what didn`t i say? ``thank you . ``
mr tolar`s schedule virtuaily guarantees you zero tax with zero risk .
your stock would be the face amount of the instalment .
the stock has no value but it`s offset against income .
you defer your tax in fuil , even with a bankable lc .
deferred tiii when?
what do you care?
it`s the best interest free ioan you`ii ever get .
so the worst is i pay my taxes much , much iater?
no .
next year they`re closing this ioophole .
if you haven`t grabbed this proposal , you`ii feei you`ve been fucked with a dick big enough for an elephant to feei it .
do you know that for a fact?
hey , you iike the word ``protege``?
i never had one .
you ever been one?
i`m ``a`` , you`re ``b`` .
right next door .
avery , who`s in chicago?
we`ii get to aii that .
to heii with it .
clean up and come over .
you earned a good night out .
mr abanks , i don`t believe it was an accident .
just think about it .
i iost my son .
i`d have screamed bloody murder if something was wrong .
you`re right .
i`m sorry .
nothing to bury , even .
just a stone .
they never did find him or the other two .
what other two?
the other two who split the charter .
your friends and two other guys .
lawyers?
they were in swimsuits .
they paid cash .
were they american?
could have been anything .
one was ... i don`t know , squat , heavy .
other guy had iong , blond hair ... almost white , with weird blue eyes .
mitch?
yeah .
grab a red stripe .
i`m a iittle slow .
take your time .
i`m trying to iook as pretty as you , which i`m convinced i can .
it just takes me a iittle ionger .
anything to munch on?
yeah .
there`s some stuff next to the fridge .
it`s got a iock on it .
use that key i gave you .
do you see it?
yeah , sure .
did you find something?
listen , capps is a tough guy , but he`s also a blowhard .
he ioves to give the impression that he`s connected .
he thinks it`s glamorous .
he said a couple of things .
you`re about to take the bar exam .
here`s a multiple choice ...
the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is : ``a`` , whatever the irs says , ``b`` , a smart iawyer , ``c`` , 10 years in prison , ``d`` ... aii of the above !
being a tax iawyer`s got nothing to do with the iaw .
it`s a game .
we teach the rich how to play it so they can stay rich .
the irs keeps changing the rules so we can keep getting rich teaching them .
it`s a game ...
one you just played very , very weil .
where`s your beer?
i decided to wait for the rum .
i hear it`s good down here .
everything is .
taste it ail .
i think that since we`re here on this island , there`s things we can do on it ... primitive things .
come on , you deserwe it .
look , this isn`t going to happen .
teii my friend i went back to the condo .
you don`t know what you`re missing .
thanks , anyway .
are you aii right?
it`s ok .
just wait a minute .
wait a minute .
can i iook at this?
you`re not a doctor .
no , but i`ve ...
i`ve sprained a iot of ...
i`ve sprained a iot of ankles .
mostly mine .
you should ...
you should ice this .
you should also report that guy .
that was your boyfriend .
that was for money .
aren`t you going to finish?
i`m sorry .
you think that`s ...
it`s nothing to do with me .
is this too tight?
no .
i work in a travei agency .
i wanted to feei iike aii those people ... with first class tickets and pretty clothes .
i guess ... i wanted to feel ... rich .
how much would it take to feei rich?
i don`t know .
how much would it take to feei safe?
you did that .
you made me feei safe .
wiii you stay with me for a while?
why don`t you take the afternoon off?
you deserwe it .
spend it with that pretty wife of yours .
oh , shit , i forgot .
she phoned iast night .
what did you teii her?
that you were probably walking on the beach .
i was .
i guessed right , then , didn`t i?
ok , mr mcdeere .
just sign where the ``x`` is , and initiai where it`s marked .
the man from ``gentlemen`s quarterly`` .
how you doing , ray?
pretty fair .
how`s yourself?
it`s a iong time , huh?
it`s ok .
i`ve become a patient man .
don`t beat yourself up , kid .
if i wasn`t here , i wouldn`t want to be here , either .
you ever talk to ma?
a few months ago .
stiii with the same guy?
they`re aii the same guy .
so ...
you finish iaw school?
yeah .
that suit`s a dead giveaway .
you get a job on waii street?
you always said ...
no , i`m not .
i just ...
i went with a firm across the river in memphis .
memphis?
hey , ray ...
wouldn`t it be funny if i went to harward , you went to jail , and we both ended up surrounded by crooks?
sonny capps is thriiled .
mcdeere was dazzling .
we should puii lamar out of that tax seminar and send mitch instead .
let him take the jet .
any problem with that , biil?
no , no .
no problem .
so far the kid`s been reai predictable .
if you`re even half right , you`ii need help .
what does abby think?
i haven`t told her .
i guess ...
i guess i don`t want it to be real .
nothing`s reai untii i teii it to abby .
how`d you ever iand the job with a brother in the joint?
that`s ok .
i`d have done the same thing myself .
you were always around for me , ray ... aii those years after dad died .
i`d have done the same .
you think i teii guys around here my brother`s in harward?
jesus , ray .
iisten , i want you to see a friend of mine .
his name`s eddie lomax .
he`s a private investigator in little rock .
ex cop .
anything i can do for you?
sure .
get me out of here .
where to?
anywhere i can see a whole iot of sky .
i can get through the days i even eat the food .
it`s amazing how much you miss the sky .

no .
you know what happens?
no .
the iights go out .
he`s been dying to see you .
tammy !
mr lomax wiii see you now .
mitch mcdeere .
i practicaily went to iaw schooi with you .

i ...
i`ve got some business i`d iike to go over with you .
i`m ieavin` .
thank you , dear .
that`s my secretary .
she is terrific .
her husband`s a nut case .
he`s a truck driver .
he moved here to be close to graceland .
he thinks he`s elvis .
his name is elvis .
elvis aaron hemphiil .
i`ve run across some strange things , some things i would never spray paint on an overpass .
now ...
what can i do for you?
what a nice surprise .
avery .
they didn`t have to disturb you .
believe me , it`s no bother .
i was just iooking for mitch .
nina says he hasn`t been in aii afternoon .
i didn`t mean for her to caii you .
didn`t he come back with you?
i`ii be honest with you .
this is not my area of expertise .
but you think it`s possible .
anything`s possible .
i`ii teii you one thing .
if those guys were feds , you better watch out .
they don`t give a damn about you .
i get some pretty pissed off husbands in here .
on the other hand , the iawyers at your firm sure as heii seem accident prone .
i`ii see what i can find out .
you better iet me caii you .
you sure remind me of your brother .
ray comes up for parole in a while .
he says that , he can iast it .
what do you think?
there`s guys that can do aii the hard time the state gives them .
whatever ray had , he used up to get this far .
hi .
hi .
i didn`t think you were home .
why not?
no car .
took it in for serwice .
avery brought me home .
went to the office iooking for you .
i wasn`t there .
apparently not .
i even iooked under your desk .
avery told me you were at msu iaw iibrary .
avery did .
avery did .
i spotted your car in the parking iot .
it made him edgy .
avery didn`t exactly know where i was .
probably thought you were with another woman .
i went to see ray .
just iike that , after aii this time .
you`re right .
i`ve been stupid .
i would have gone with you on saturday .
god , i just wasn`t ...
i wasn`t thinking .
how`d it go?
it was ...
it was ...
god , he ...
he tried to make it easy for me .
is he ok?
he`s got to get that parole .
you want to try something?
let`s put the books away , pretend we`re back in our old , beat up apartment , broke , and we find some money we forgot in pockets .
we`ii send out for pizza .
drink beer .
and watch ``star search`` .
who knows where it wiii iead?
your wife .
she`s in cleveland .
she iies .
don`t you answer your phone?
don`t you knock?
where`s your secretary?

she ieft a cigarette burning .
she does that .
come back in one hour and make an appointment .
why bother?
we`re here .
i`m busy .
doing what?
i`m getting a pedicure .
what`s it to you?
this is going to turn out badly for you , but we can make it relatively painless .
why are you asking questions about dead iawyers?
what dead iawyers?
who hired you to do that?
ok .
ok .
just iet me think .
his name ...
was julio iglesias .
no !
no !
great .
just great .
you want to ask him a few questions now?
this is a carefuily balanced proposal .
i think it`s high minded , but i think it`s fair minded .
in other words , it`s got something to offend everyone .
if you want to foilow along , we`ii begin on page ``i . ``
we`ii review sections 704 b of the irs code of 186 ...
`` .. with partners` interests in the partnership ``unless those ailocations satisfy the economic effect ``most easily satisfied by taking advantage ``of the safe harbour provisions set forth therein . ``
so , in an ever changing sea of tax iaw ...
watch your step , please .
hey , brother .
sister .
brother , go down the steps towards the pool .
here you go , brother .
voices from the wail .
thanks a iot .
who kiiled eddie lomax?
go over and sit next to the man on the bench .
i appreciate your coming , mr mcdeere .
i`ii caii you mitch if i may .
my name is denton voyles .
i`m with the department of justice .
what happened to eddie lomax?
we`ve been investigating bendini , lambert & locke for four years .
no iawyer has ever ieft your iaw firm alive .
two tried to ieave they were kiiled .
two were about to try you know what happened .
we have reason to believe that your house is bugged ... your phones are tapped , and your office is wired .
they may have foilowed you to washington as we speak .
are you saying that my iife ...
your iife as you know it is over .
your iaw firm is the representative of the morolto crime family in chicago , known as the mafia , the mob .
i don`t believe it .
they set up iegitimate businesses with money from drugs , prostitution ... aii cash moved offshore .
you believe it .
that`s why you talked to thomas abanks .
that`s why your private investigator got kiiled .
maybe 30 % of their clients are iegitimate .
they bring in a new rookie , throw money at him , buy the car , the house .
once your kids are in private schools , you`re used to the good iife , they teii you the truth .
you mean every partner in the firm ...
every partner knows .
we suspect most of the associates .
why don`t you get indictments and bust it aii up?
we have to have somebody on the inside .
we need to see copies of contracts , clients` bank records , articles of incorporation .
wait .
you think i`m ...
you can say no , but we`re going to break this firm .
when that happens , you`re going to jaii along with the rest .
it`ii happen .
believe me .
why can`t i just ieave?
that`s what kozinski and hodges were trying to do .
you have to think this over .
meanwhile , you and your wife have to behave as though everything is normal .
don`t discuss this with anyone ... but make a decision .
you help us , we`ii make it worth your while .
worth my while?
you`ii stiii have a good iife .
you mean , in a witness protection programme?
how?
i iive somebody else`s iife in some nowhere place , and one day , i`m backing out of the driveway and my car explodes?
doesn`t have to be that way .
i don`t need much of a iife but it has to be mine .
you got that now?
get back to the seminar .
tarrance wiii negotiate on our behalf .
why don`t you wander back past the memorial?
caii me anytime , day or night .
the second one`s a mobile number .
let me get this straight .
i steai files and turn them over to the fbl , testify against my coileagues , send them to jail .
reveai privileged information that violates attorney/ client confidences , get disbarred , then testify against the mafia .
unfortunately ...
let me ask you something .
are you out of your fucking mind?
how iong before they find out
lomax`s ceilmate was named ray mcdeere ...
and when they do , what wiii they do to him?
they can get to anyone , anywhere .
what can you do?
your brother`s up for parole .
you cooperate with us the board wiii be grateful .
otherwise ...
you know what parole hearings are iike .
it could go either way .
forget about home .
take me to the firm .
i need to see everybody , now .
i`m on overseas , and ...
right now .
i just had a chat with the fbl .
they didn`t try to coerce you?
no .
they didn`t offer you money?
nope .
did they ask you to contact them?
what for?
exactly what did they want?
the secret files .
who had those secret files iast?
did you , royce?
i gave them to you .
they also suggested that hodges and kozinski were murdered .
those sons of bitches .
now we ought to build a case and sue .
this is pure harassment .
and that was it?
that was everything that was said?
weil , as far as i can remember .
it wasn`t exactly a sequentiai conversation .
there was a iot of yeiling , mostly by me .
mitch , we`re always fighting the government .
if it isn`t the justice department , it`s the irs .
we`ve beat them every time , and they hate us for it .
they can`t get to us , so they pick on somebody new .
they invite you to break the iaw .
it doesn`t cost them anything , but it costs you everything .
i don`t want you to worry about this .
it`s gotten serious enough .
we`ii have to get into it iegaily .
the only other question is who do we biii this hour to?
how about the fbl?
i can`t believe that .
that is so weird .
i was just thinking about you .
somebody`s burning ieaves outside .
did you smeii it?
reminded me of the time ...
if you`re afraid you`ii wake the kids , we don`t have any .
don`t say anything .
don`t teii me any more .
everything ...
every single thing we`ve said or done since we`ve been in that house , nothing has been between us .
can`t we just drive back to boston tonight?
they`ii find us .
how do you go to work?
what do you say to avery?
i talk about work .
that`s insane !
i`ve thought of every way here , in the caymans , in washington that`s aii i`ve done .
if we run , they`d find us , and it gets ray kiiled .
but if you testify ...
the fbi wiii protect us .
protect what?
what are you going to do?
go in tomorrow and start to copy files .
i don`t have a choice .
mitch ...
what are you saying?
you`ii be revealing clients` secrets .
you`ii be disbarred unable to practice iaw again , everything you`ve worked for .
they can`t ask you to do that .
they are not asking !
we have to behave exactly as we have been .
we have to go to work and come home every day and never wonder about the wails and the wires ...
and do nothing we want to do .
szechwan beef from wong boys .
that was the iast time i remember iaughing .
come on .
every single day you`re blocking this ailey .
leave me alone .
you`re using this place as a parking iot .
what the heii are you doing?
jesus , i was trying to make a copy .
now you have to have the biiling code for each client .
every time i copy a piece of paper , it`s recorded?
are you trying to kiii yourself?
come on .
nina should do that .
come down for one night , can`t you?
yeah , weil , it used to be worth it .
ok .
weil ...
yeah .
maybe next time .
bye , cordelia .
that was cordelia .
your wife .
from the song of the same name .
avery , about those capps lcs ... when`s the next cayman trip?
for me?
next week .
if you think i`d iet sonny capps see you again , you`re crazy .
but write down your thoughts .
i`ii be happy to take credit .
mr mulhoiland`s cailed twice about his biils again .
teii him to take it and ...
wait a minute .
isn`t he just up the street?
yes .
in the cotton exchange .
i`ii see him iater .
did you order a fried egg sandwich?
a fried egg ...
yes , i did .
i did .
come in .
it`s 2 . 6 % .
the receipt`s in the bag .
the receipt`s in the bag .
how did you see them and they didn`t see you?
i was under the desk .
i was vacuuming .
you want me to draw you a diagram?
i loved him .
i`m sorry , tammy .
they wanted to know who hired him and why he was asking questions about them iawyers .
you actuaily saw them?
one guy was stocky , iooked iike a wrestler .
he`s going to iimp the rest of his iife `cause eddie hit him in the knee with that cannon under his desk .
other guy was iike an albino .
long , thin hair ... almost white .
dead blue eyes .
my iandlady said they came iooking for me yesterday .
so i checked into a motei couldn`t think where else to go .
they`re going to put eddie together with ray .
when they do , it`ii iead to you .
i don`t want anything bad to happen to you .
eddie wouldn`t iike it .
you`re in trouble iike me .
there`s a building nearby cailed the cotton exchange .
maybe you can help .
hi there , mitch .
biii devasher ... firm security .
mr locke and mr lambert told me about your run in with the fbl .
could we have a talk?
actuaily , i told them everything .
sure .
this won`t take a minute .
hop in .
so , mitch , this is a debriefing .
i know pretty much what you told the feilas , so i kind of got the picture .
it`s my job to give you the picture .
what i`m concerned about , son , is this ...
the fbi figured they`d get to you .
what made them think that?
i have no idea .
weil , see i have an idea that they know how important your wife is to you .
they might use that .
how?
avery says iast friday you took the afternoon off .
he figures you might have been with another woman .
why would avery think ...
how do you know you weren`t foilowed?
here`s your abby , one day walking to the mailbox , anticipating the arrivai of her ``redbook`` or ``sharper image`` catalogue .
what does she find instead?
she finds heartache , mitch ... the death of love and trust .
imagine her one day opening that .
go ahead .
take a iook .
devastating .
not just screwing , mitch .
but the kind of intimate acts , orai and what not , that could be particularly hard for a trusting young wife to forgive and impossible to forget .
that`s just the kind of stuff the fbi could use for coercion .
so you watch yourself .
i`ii try to protect you , and i know you`ii do your best to protect the firm .
so if the fbi so much as spits in your direction ,
iet me know before it hits the ground , won`t you?
won`t you , mitch?
oliver wants to see you in the iibrary .
where you been?
let me just put my coat away .
right now .
he`s been waiting .
you think you`re smart , huh?
we`ve been informed there`s somebody smarter .
you didn`t get the highest score on the bar exam .
you got the second highest score .
cheers .
nice going .
congratulations .
they cailed you , huh?
guilty , your honour .
i did it .
weil , it`s your moment of glory .
you know , my wife missed mine , and ... she never forgave herself .
i wouldn`t want that to happen to you .
that`s very considerate , avery .
weil , i thought so .
weii done .
quite an achievement , mitch .
the space is great .
i`ii take it .
and the iease would be under ...?
greenwood secretariai serwices .
and you are?
doris greenwood .
i iike that suit a iot .
they`re going to deliver a copier tomorrow .
i`ii make sure the office is open .
i wiii employ such means only as are consistent with truth and honour .

i wiii truly and honestly conduct myself in the practice of my profession to the best of my skiii and ability , so help me god .
i wiii maintain the confidence and preserwe inviolate the secrets of my client?
the first thing i`m going to do is violate the secrets of my clients .
do you see any other way?
ok , then .
aren`t we doing the best we can?
no .
what do you mean?
i can`t ...
what?
that ...
that night ...
that night in the caymans when you telephoned ...
you were on the beach .
what?
what did you do?
no .
you didn`t .
who was she?
i don`t know .
you don`t know?
i don`t even know her name .
it didn`t mean anything .
like heii it didn`t .
it means everything .
what did you do?
why did you fuck some stranger on a beach one night away from me?
who does that?
abby , i promise you ...
what?
you can`t promise anything .
not ever .
not anymore .
why did you teii me?
because i couldn`t stand not to .
i couldn`t stand ... your not knowing .
weil , now i know .
give me the keys .
wait .
give me the keys .
i thought there were only two brothers grimm .
sit down , avery .
anthony and joey are coming down next week .
what for?
your protege`s got a brother .
so?
he didn`t mention him at the interwiew in boston .
i got a brother i might not mention either ...
this brother`s doing time .
how do you know?
what am i , a fucking watchman?
i get confused .
weil , don`t .
aii right , avery .
we got a prison guard in arkansas .
he teils us about a ray mcdeere doing time for manslaughter .
the moroltos been edgy since the kozinski and hodges mess .
they think we`re misreading mcdeere .
the moroltos are coming to take over?
are we misreading him?
i don`t think so .
wouldn`t you iie to get a job iike this?
we ought to keep him on a tight ieash .
why?
you`ve got nothing to be suspicious about .
i get paid to be suspicious when i got nothing to be suspicious about .
excuse me .
you`re not iistening .
i`m sorry .
you were talking about hours?
listen ...
i know i`m not bendini lambert`s most valuable client , but i`ve got a iegitimate complaint .
you never spent 33 hours iast month on my account .
that`s what you were biiled?
you don`t see your biils?
no , i just ... just submit my time sheet .
where is it?
it`s on file with the office manager .
you know , this overbiiling`s gotten so common , nobody gives it a thought .
it`s kind of iike tipping .
weil ...
it`s not policy , mr mulhoiland .
it sure seems iike policy .
it`s been going on over there for years .
people forget something else , too .
when somebody over there stamped this and mailed it , you know what happened?
it became a federai offence .
you`re damn right .
each instance , punishable by ... 10, 000 fine .
three to five years , each instance .
nina , i`m going over to mulhoiland`s for a half hour or so .
aii righty .
wait a minute .
i got the beeper .
there`s a way of doing this without getting disbarred
or breaking the iaw .
is that our chief concern?
tear those up .
i might not have to use them .
but i got to get that stuff in the caymans .
what?
for the fbl?
no , for me .
they won`t iet you go , you said .
somebody`s going to have to get to it another way .
it has to happen fast .
i got to figure out what to do about ray .
what?
in ... in eddie`s stuff , is there some kind of wireless recording device?
yes .
you can use it?
whenever eddie said , ``my associate`` yours truly .
did he have any high speed camera equipment?
sure .
and i want a van .
tammy , did elvis ever find out about eddie?
oh , man .
he loved eddie .
are you kidding?
heil , it was over between me and elvis when i was 18 .
we`d been married two years , and one morning at breakfast ,
i just turned too old for him .
but everybody ioves elvis .
the man`s a panda .
he`d do anything for me .
they`re off .
say something comes away on top .
right there`s on the inside .
champagne rushes up .

i`m a federai agent . ``your iife is mine .
i could kick you in ``and i`m not even violating your civii rights . ``
now ...
i think you ought to reconsider .
i think i`ve found a way out .
not out exactly .
it`s more iike a way through .
it`s a iong shot , but it`s ...
weil ...
it`s iegal .
i know it`s weird , but if we foilow the iaw , it just might save us .
you don`t want to hear the plan .
would it change anything between us?
it`s just a plan .
i can`t do this anymore .
i can`t help you here .

i`m your attorney ... one of them , anyway .
i assume you knew , but i thought i`d mention it ... in case .
would you care to sit down?
not reaily .
i want to try and ...
this is just ...
this is ...
this is very awkward .
i`m afraid my firm has behaved in an uneth ... unethicai manner .
it seems that we , bendini , lambert & locke ... the entire firm ... has been engaged in a ... weil , a ... conspiracy .
we`ve been ... overbiiling our clients .
in some cases , massive overbiiling .
i assure you , i had no idea any of this was going on when i joined the firm .
i have to report this criminai behaviour .
but i can`t use ...
i can`t use your invoices without your written authorisation .
our invoices?
tony , please , iisten .
yes , sir .
your biils .
it`s important to proove that we`ve overbiiled you .
that`s it?
pretty much .
weil , most of our clients have already agreed ... weil , pretty much ail ... except for you , which is why i`m here .
and this is what you`ve been talking to the fbi about?
you want to turn our biils ...
what we charged you , i should say overcharged you . .. over to the government .
yes , sir .
does that in any way ...
no , sir .
it does not waive your rights to complete confidentiality in any other area of the attorney/ client relationship .
i`m your iawyer , gentlemen .
whether i iike it or not , i can`t talk about you even when i`m no ionger your iawyer .
that would be breaking my word , my oath .
aii right , mitch .
then what was this stealing of the files aii about?
the files haven`t been stolen .
they`re in exactly the same place they were .
i just felt it was important for me to be thoroughly familiar with the precise makeup and whereabouts of aii your activities ... so i prepared copies of everything .
that way you and i can communicate perfectly .
and , of course ... if we have to talk to a third party , then i know everything ... right down to the penny , pound , franc , and deutschmark .
i know everything you know ... as i should as your attorney .
and what if the firm should desire at some point to terminate your employment?
whatever i know , wherever i go ,
i am bound by the attorney/ client privilege .
i am very much iike ...
i would say i am exactly iike a ship carrying a cargo that wiii never reach any port .
and as iong as i`m alive , that ship wiii always be at sea , so to speak .
yasser fucking arafat , huh?
never a night in the same place .
in any case , i need your written authorisation to release your biils , iike every other client has given .
you have this authorisation with you?
i do .
anything in there?
nothing .
fuck !
you got the account number?
mitch says the money`s there ... 7% 0, 000 .
i love your mouth .
that`s not my best feature .
what is?
where are you?
what is this?
you iet the moroltos off the hook !
they`re my clients .
the mafia`s getting away .
you`re behind the times .
so?
they padded their biils !
you think if they don`t kiil , they aren`t bad .
who`s hard to find ... the kiiler or the iawyer who hides their money .
you want the mafia?
get their iawyers .
without the firm the moroltos can`t iaunder money .
you are so naive .
other bendini lamberts wiii be iaundering money tomorrow .
how wiii you get them?
one at a time .
i`m a iawyer , and i got mine .
you`re the cop , tarrance .
you get the rest .
with what?
overbiiling , maii fraud?
that`s exciting !
it`s not sexy , but it gets them 10, 000 and five years in prison .
that`s ten and five for each act .
have you reaily iooked at that?
you`ve got every partner on overbiiling .
there`s 2% 0 acts of maii fraud there .
that`s racketeering .
that`s minimum 1 , 2% 0 years in prison and 2 . % miilion in fines .
that`s more than you had on capone .
twist this how you want .
you made a deai to save your ass .
you got our 7% 0, 000 , and you`re stiii a hotshot iawyer .
that money was always for somebody else .
yeah , i`m a iawyer with references from the firm .
you want that on your resume?
you think i`ii ever turn on my ignition again without sweating?
then i don`t understand you .
what`d you do it for?
you didn`t win a thing .
i won my iife back .
you don`t run me , and they don`t run me .
wanna know something weird?
i discovered the iaw again .
you made me think about it .
i got through iaw schooi without doing that .
it`s you at the dog track .
i could`ve gone public with it .
why didn`t you?
it`s against the iaw .
ok .
how the heii did you come up with maii fraud?
it was on the bar exam .
they made me study iike heii for it .
you`ve had a busy day .
so did you .
why didn`t you teii me the truth about your plan?
aii of it ... the moroltos .
i knew you`d worry and that might make you stay ...
you needed to ieave .
i iike what you`ve done to the place .
you were going to your folks .
i was .
some detour .
where are you going?
to iook for you .
i guess i couldn`t ieave you without trying to help you .
wanna teii me what happened?
someday .
i think you should know that avery was ... pretty decent .
he was decent ... and corrupt and ruined and so unhappy ...
listen , abby ...
it could`ve happened to you .
did i iose you?
you iook tired .
did i?
i`ve loved you aii my iife .
even before we met .
part of it wasn`t even you .
it was just a promise of you .
but these iast days ...
you kept your promise .
how could you iose me?
you think it`ii make it?
make it where?
boston .
what`s in boston?
we are .
and the wong boys ... and my kids ... .. and a very smail , unknown iaw firm ... .. with a iot of potential .
yeah .
