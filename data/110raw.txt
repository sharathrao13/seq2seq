rescue 3 , jessie , do you see him yet?
patience , my love .
i think i have him sighted .
frank , what's the word?
we've got him .
other there .
rescue centre , over .
this is 3 .
go ahead .
you will have sufficient cloud base to get into the tower .
there is still some turbulence .
we advise against a winch rescue .
i'll proceed with a wire cross from the opposite tower .
gabe , hal's signalling that he's okay .
gabe , where are you?
i'm just hanging out , jess .
that butt looks familiar .
careful , you'll embarrass frank .
it'll take more than that .
gabe , they're below the top , on the ledge just above you .
glad you could join us .
sure .
hi , sarah .
so , how's the knee?
i think it's out .
no big deal .
i remember when you twisted it getting out of the hot tub .
i thought you did it in nam?
really?
i've located a stranded climber .
please send down a transport line .
how are you feeling?
fine , considering .
what do you say we take off and leave this clown behind?
don't tempt me .
rescue 3 ... be advised ranger walker is making advances toward my girlfriend .
say he'll make advances to me only , or he'll be climbing down 4, 000 ft .
baby , he lies .
is it really 4, 000?
about that .
whatever this guy says about me , don't believe it .
okay , come on over .
i know you're nervous , but we've done this 100 times .
captain hot tub , keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle .
great , hal !
that really inspires confidence .
how did he get you to climb here?
he said it was better than sex .
ready for the park's best ride?
i'll let you know .
you look like hell .
he made it .
of course , there's nothing to it .
i can do this .
sure you can .
i'm sorry for all the trouble .
don't worry about it .
did you see that?
we're still on for dinner tonight?
of course .
okay , you're ready now .
that's it .
just sit down into it .
come on , guys .
the wind's picking up .
sarah , just keep your eyes on me .
don't look ...
look at me .
start to pull .
one hand after another .
you're doing great .
keep going .
keep looking at me .
that's great .
you're starting to look like a pro .
nice and easy .
hal , we're going to be out of a job soon .
a little more , sarah .
that's it .
that's it .
one , two ...
sarah !
i'm going to fall .
no you're not .
you're okay .
can you reach the main line?
no !
keep the line steady .
that clip won't hold .
gabe , you have to go after her .
sarah , i'm coming to get you .
no , it's not rigged for two people .
i'll send out my harness .
there's no time for that .
shit !
no !
sarah , i'm coming for you .
i'm slipping .
i'm coming for you .
hurry , i can't hold on .
don't look down .
look at me .
i'm trying .
she's losing it .
he'll have you in a second , baby .
hurry , gabe .
you're almost there .
i'm here , sarah ,
i don't want to die .
reach up and grab him .
reach up .
use your other hand .
hold on .
i've got you .
i can't hold on .
you're not going to die .
don't lose her .
i'm slipping .
you can do it , sarah .
hold her , gabe .
i don't want to die .
you're not going to die .
i've got you , just reach up .
please , just reach up .
hal , i'm slipping .
gabe , don't you lose her .
don't let me fall .
i'm slipping .
sarah , please .
don't let me fall !
i'm falling !
gabe !
no , sarah !
8 months later
lock them up .
we'll be ready in ten minutes .
good .
mr. travers .
this is agent matheson , fbl .
richard travers .
matheson has been transferred to the frisco office .
can he hitch a ride?
we've got plenty of room .
i appreciate it .
have you been totally briefed?
i don't know about totally ...
it's a protective shipment . $1, 000 bills aren't in circulation .
they're for international exchange .
do you always transport by air?
cars and trains can be hijacked .
nobody can touch us in flight .
i haven't lost a bill in 12 years .
treasury agents are the most superstitious of all .
we should be .
everybody wants what we have .
it's gabe .
he's back .
i can see that .
gabe !
let's go .
how are you doing?
turn that down .
how you doing , guys?
did you fall off the planet?
i've been working in denver .
don't say that word , man .
i hate work .
we're flying off the tower today .
come with us .
today's the day .
killer jump .
no , thanks .
are you scared of heights now?
no ...
you guys better watch out .
some bad weather's coming in .
we like it extreme .
it's good to have you back .
good to see you .
how are you doing , jess?
hello , gabriel .
you've got yourself a new horse?
where have you been?
working .
after the funeral i had to leave .
had to leave?
a lot of us wanted to leave .
but you know what?
we stayed .
things fell apart on that ledge .
i know .
you don't know how much .
you did everything you could .
did i?
maybe i shouldn't have gone out on that line .
maybe i panicked .
i was there .
you didn't panic , so quit hoarding all the guilt .
you held on as long as you could .
and what was hal doing on the tower with an amateur?
i can't blame hal for anything .
it was me .
all me .
give it up , gabe , because it doesn't get any better .
it doesn't get any better?
you really don't understand .
what?
i don't think you understand .
i don't understand?
i think i'm the only one that understands .
there were times when i didn't know whether to hate you or love you .
but one thing i do know is , i understand you .
did you come back to stay?
you didn't .
i can't , not here .
jessie , i came back for you .
i want you to come with me .
you've been gone almost a year and you expect me to just leave?
this is our home .
now it's my home .
i can't just pick up and go for all the wrong reasons .
i better get the rest of my stuff .
you know where everything is .
i'm late for work .
r 5 l , broken cloud at 20, 000 feet .
severe storm advisory .
check the scope .
i hear you've been transferred .
yeah , moving up in the world .
jessie , look at this masterpiece .
i think old frank nailed it with that stroke .
what do you think?
i don't know .
what do you see?
surprise me .
what usually eats a banana?
a monkey .
this is a banana eating a monkey .
nature in reverse .
where?
right here .
frank , you look like a normal guy , but he's not .
are you , frankie?
hey , i'm an artist .
we're being tracked .
we have a jetstar at three o'clock .
don't anyone jump to conclusions .
he's coming in too slow .
slow down to 180 knots .
he's slowing down .
get your guns .
i have jurisdiction on this jet .
now i have jurisdiction .
get your weapons .
mr. matheson , you're overreacting .
calm down and give me the gun .
don't you see what he's doing?
he's hijacking the shipment .
what the fuck was that?
move into position .
crossover transfer in ten seconds .
n 1295 l , this is jetstar 680 tt .
is frequency secure?
roger , tt .
go ahead .
what is your heading and speed?
we're heading 080 , doing 250 knots .
our flight level is 2109 .
5 l , we're opening up .
we'll begin closing .
bring your speed back to 150 .
commence descent to level 140 and turn right onto 260 .
we're level at 140 .
the weather ahead is threatening .
travers , report your position .
disengaging tail cone .
tail cone is clear .
roger .
phase 1 , complete .
prepare to receive cable .
standing by .
what's the turbulence back there?
she's all over the place .
sounds like fun .
we're streaming the drogue now .
the welcoming party is ready .
we're coming to pick up the drogue now .
we've got it .
stand by , kristel .
standing by .
we're locked on .
lnto the transfer position .
moving into transfer position .
closing to 1 40 feet .
we're closing .
will report when in position .
we're too close to the storm .
that'll make the crash look real .
hurry up , travers .
i'm on my way .
the cases are hooked up .
the charge goes off in five minutes .
stick to the plan and you're rich .
tt , in position .
what's taking so long?
patience .
i'm coming over .
tt standing by at level 140 and 260 degrees .
5 l , i'm out of here .
what the hell is he doing?
where are the cases?
we've got him , kristel .
why didn't you send the money first?
somehow i didn't think you'd wait for me .
we're approaching the storm fast .
90 seconds , kristel .
what's keeping him?
move your ass .
i'm at the cases .
tt , standing by .
you fuck !
we've lost the pilot .
who did you leave up there?
get underneath the jet .
the cases will slide over .
who the fuck is that?
just get those cases .
he's hurt bad .
get him to a hospital fast .
we're not levelling out .
i've lost hydraulics .
the cable has blown free .
don't lose the money .
pull the cable .
the switches are dead .
nothing .
okay , switch to manual .
hold the plane steady !
pull !
come on !
how's number one engine?
oil pressure falling .
shit !
we've lost them .
release the cable .
close it up .
so this is your idea of a fool proof plan?
stupid bastard .
what's the report?
he shot out the hydraulics .
i've got a fire warning light .
we're going down .
pick your way through the peaks .
shut off all fuel pumps .
don't buckle up , you may not want to survive this .
flaps to 25 degrees before we lose all power .
reduce power 60 % .
crank the flaps down .
gear down?
no .
shut down all power .
give me a hand with the controls .
did you catch that thunder?
that wasn't thunder .
come on .
i'm free !
radical , man .
look at me .
mike?
shit .
you thought of everything .
except this .
kill the pig .
pig , my ass !
we're partners in this .
we were .
give me the tracking monitor .
what the hell for?
don't make him ask you twice .
give it to him .
here , it's only got 50, 000 code variations .
i'll break your fucking neck .
go ahead .
but you're going to need that money to buy your way out of this country .
you know it , and i know it .
how do we get off the mountain?
kristel?
i think we've found a frequency .
somebody help .
is there somebody there?
rocky mountain rescue .
come in .
thank god .
we're stranded .
we were hiking and lost our way .
the weather came in fast .
how many people in your party?
five .
i don't know where we are .
by a cylindrical rock formation .
it's got to be comb bluff .
we can't get a chopper up there .
we're on our way .
please hurry .
billy's in shock .
we need insulin .
please , hurry .
we need insulin .
would you have thought of that?
five climbers are stranded on comb bluff .
hal's gone up alone .
hal's a good climber .
what's that supposed to mean?
he can handle it .
if he gets socked in by the weather , they'll never make it down .
he needs someone to help him .
it's not me he wants help from .
those people need help .
what if he can't do it alone?
i haven't climbed in months .
you've lost your nerve .
i didn't mean that .
it's okay .
you don't want the responsibility anymore , but he was your friend .
he took the west ridge .
if you take the north face , you can beat him .
don't you feel anything anymore?
feel anything?
jessie , i came back for you .
it's not about me , it's about you .
if you leave , you'll be stuck on that ledge all your life .
where the hell is that plane?
she went down in the storm .
the storm's still building .
it's impossible to see anything .
what about roads?
there aren't any roads .
mr. wright , these men are fbl .
agents hayes and michaels .
if it's about your agent , i've got nothing to tell you .
matheson was on surveillance .
surveillance of what?
there have been reports of treasury jets being monitored .
we thought it was an inside job .
you're suggesting a hijacking?
i had my best men on that flight .
those cases were monitored .
the currency isn't exchangeable .
it's useless for anyone to steal it .
except for this man .
his name is eric qualen .
we've been tracking him .
a former military intelligence guy who decided to change sides .
industrial espionage , diamond smuggling , stolen bearer bonds .
he has the international connections to move this currency . $100 million is a hell of a temptation to him .
what the hell are you doing here?
jessie filled me in .
well , now let me fill you in .
you take your ass back down to that hole you've been hiding in .
let's get these people down first .
no , you're out of here now .
did you come up here to prove something?
i know how you feel about me .
you don't know anything .
you did it your way ... and she died .
i did what i thought was right .
your weight on the line did it .
there wasn't any other way .
i guess we'll never know .
it was a bad time for everybody .
what the hell do you know?
you didn't love her .
and you didn't have to look into her eyes when she fell .
now , drop it .
no , buddy .
it was you who dropped it .
you want to do it?
do it .
no .
you live with it .
they're here .
right on time .
how many of them are there?
two .
we'll greet them at the top .
where's the helicopter?
what's going on?
where's the helicopter?
it can't fly in this weather .
are you chopper pilots?
no .
what are your names?
tucker and walker .
we're missing three bags .
what's in them?
none of your business !
socks and $100 million .
the usual stuff .
travers has a tracking device .
don't use my name , damn it !
key it .
look at the map .
those are our belongings .
the red dots are the three cases .
do you recognise these locations?
if you don't , you're useless .
useless items are discarded .
right , travers?
get off my back , qualen .
off?
i haven't even got on it yet .
do you recognise these locations?
ryan .
yeah , we do .
then let's go .
wait a minute , asshole !
where is it?
up there .
this is rescue centre .
come in , hal .
you're hal?
you , stay .
you ... ... fetch !
fetch !
do it .
rescue 1 , do you copy?
hal , come in , over .
watch yourself under the overhang .
when you feel like talking , don't .
we're waiting .
i need my bolt gun and ice axe .
no .
take his coat for insurance .
he could freeze to death .
you've got your own problems , hal .
ryan , get a rope .
i want this dog on a leash .
tie it .
it'd better hold .
forget me .
get away .
would you?
go fetch , wonder dog .
move it , walker .
ryan , keep it taut .
hal , come in .
i don't trust him .
damn !
i don't think we need two guides .
retire him when he comes down .
they're gonna kill you !
pull the rope !
pull , goddamn it !
pull it .
pull , goddamn it .
watch it !
get him .
no !
your friend just had the most expensive funeral in history .
come in , rescue unit .
what's going on , hal?
talk .
no messages , no codes , no tricks .
you haven't found us .
it was a fake call .
i've reached the top of the tower .
there's no sign of anyone .
it looks like a phoney call .
you're kidding .
do you want me to fly up after you?
no , the winds are still too high .
i'll ride out the storm up here .
we'll shelter at douglas ...
i'm losing you .
come in , hal .
we go on to the next case .
he said the tower , but he's on comb bluff .
fly me to the west valley .
the winds are never strong there .
he's headed for the douglas shaft .
that is a bad idea .
if i don't find him , come and pick me up by nightfall .
hal would have my head .
it's such a handsome head .
please , frank .
i'll buy one of your paintings .
hold up !
where is it?
there .
on top of the peak .
hold it .
that looks like a winding route to me .
the fastest route is the east face .
only 12 guys in the world can do it .
you want to try it?
gabe !
what's happened?
you're frozen .
where's your pack and sweater?
they got hal .
it was a fake call .
what do you mean?
before they crashed they dumped cases of money .
who's they?
they're using hal to find them .
when they do , he's dead .
you've got to call frank .
tell him to call the state police .
the cold killed my radio , but frank will be looking for me .
the sun goes down in an hour .
what should i do?
pack everything we need .
we've got to get to that next case .
we're close .
it's just up there .
it better be .
i'm getting tired of your threats .
are you?
there .
what do we do now?
have you got a pencil?
over here .
want to trade?
that son of a bitch is still alive .
i'm beginning to dislike this mr. walker .
he can't be far .
find him .
go .
give me a flare .
meet me in eagle's cave .
gravity is a bitch , isn't it?
fuck the money and fuck you .
i wasn't born to die out here .
where were you born to die?
i don't need your shit , boy .
you've got a big mouth .
stop this .
the fight's not here , it's there .
find us some shelter .
next time you're watching mtv , flip it to the weather channel .
i mean , where would you rather be?
here or playing some air hockey?
air hockey has got my vote .
exactly , cheesehead .
cheesehead?
he was here .
what was in there?
answer the man .
nothing , just tourist souvenirs .
or equipment for your friend .
he's not my friend .
i don't like him any more than i do you .
nice try , but i never underestimate the power of natural loyalty .
not like the kind that has to be paid for .
make a fire .
it costs a fortune to heat this place .
that's bad humour , i know .
get some sleep .
we're going to need it .
rescue units , come in .
do you read?
what the hell is going on up there?
jessie , do you read?
jessie !
we're drawing a crowd .
before the whole world shows up we'd better find the next one .
it's on the tower .
how far?
he asked how far , goddamn it !
we've been taking the scenic route .
how far is it?
half a day .
check it out .
it's hal .
are you stuck up here , too?
walk over .
christ , they're just kids .
we're not animals .
don't force us to be .
walk over .
that storm was a real bummer .
we went tent city last night .
we're going to take one last jump .
are you baby sitting hikers?
run !
get the hell out of here .
get him .
you son of a bitch !
you didn't have to kill them .
sue me .
shoot him , damn it !
don't let him get away .
you murdering motherfucker .
kill a few , you're a murderer .
kill a million , you're a conqueror .
go figure .
move on , tucker .
time is short .
just like you said .
he's taking them the long way round .
we have to go through there .
you said there was a way across .
where the fuck is it?
there .
are you blind?
the hell with the money .
radio the chopper .
you just don't get it , do you?
we're partners in crime .
you've crossed over , travers .
there's no crossing back .
that'll keep it dry .
let's do it .
get a good footing .
it's slick , jess .
good foothold .
jessie , don't move .
my god !
let's get out of here .
no !
jessie , get down .
hold on to me .
it's on my back .
i've got him .
there's one on my back .
there's nothing on your back .
rocky mountain centre , this is rescue 3 .
rescue centre , go ahead .
visibility is good .
if anyone is out here , i'll find them .
roger , 3 .
centre out .
i've picked up a signal on the thermal imager near comb bluff .
get out of here !
get out !
jesus christ !
here , i've got you .
there's the opening .
i'll hook up the line , and you follow me up .
the other one is following .
i'll flank him .
don't kill him till you get the money .
we've got the id on the dead pilot .
he was known to fly for qualen .
what about the treasury jet?
the wreckage is scattered .
finally .
a satellite has located the aircraft .
head 110 miles south southwest of the park entrance .
treasury control , get the rescue people on their way .
i've got it , jess .
we're almost out .
i can chop through .
jessie , come on up .
walker , small world , ain't it?
don't even think about it .
your life's on sale . $30 million .
where is it?
it's gone .
where the fuck is the money?
i burnt it .
i never could save up .
not even a dumb mountain boy like you would burn $30 million .
i'll make a deal with you .
hand over the money and i'll just kill you and not the girl .
give me the money !
gabe?
come on .
can you walk?
kynette , where's the money?
he said he torched it .
where is he now?
in a cave .
you've had your chance .
kristel , get the c 4 .
just give me five minutes .
get the fuck out of there .
good .
blow up that black bastard while you're at it .
if you want me , i'm in here .
i'm in here .
i'm in here .
you're making it too easy for me .
no bullets , bitch .
where's the money?
cissy .
you hit like a cissy .
wrong answer , motherfucker .
get up .
where is the money?
i burnt it .
wrong answer .
time to kill a mountain man .
it amazes me
that a man would put money before the personal safety
of himself and his bitch .
you can go to your grave knowing
that i'm going to treat the bitch right !
are you okay?
god !
i thought he'd killed you .
are you okay?
jessie , do you read?
do you read?
what the hell's going on?
find it .
it's ready .
rescue 1 , do you copy?
over .
here it is .
i found evan in the east valley .
he's got a gunshot wound .
he's en route to the medical centre .
in case you can hear this , i'm resuming my search .
you'll make a fine wife .
you should see me bake a cake .
he's still alive ... for another four minutes .
where is it set?
right over his head .
gabe , there's a bomb .
get out of there .
jessie , get the gear .
that charge may cause a landslide .
we've got to get to the west face .
why are we wasting time?
he's not getting that last case .
you want to kill me , don't you?
well , take a number and get in line .
tie this together , we're going to rappel down .
this rope is old , will it hold?
i don't think so .
frank !
he can't see you .
go .
here comes our ride .
move .
swing as hard as you can .
push .
jump .
frank ...
what's happening here?
welcome .
what are you doing?
back off .
i came here to help you .
dumb move .
frank .
you'd better hurry , tucker .
get the hell out of here !
maniac !
no one told you to shoot .
we've wasted enough time .
i'm sorry .
this man never hurt anybody .
touching .
kristel , check the chopper .
get back !
jessie , run !
that son of a bitch .
we use the chopper to locate the third case , then we're gone .
no , there's only enough fuel to get us down .
you're not running things , travers .
as soon as he finds the money , you're as dead as me .
give me the monitor .
now .
enter code
what's the code?
there are 50, 000 possibilities in 1 5 second intervals .
what's the fucking code?
look what agent travers has found .
i guess he is running things now .
so what's the plan?
use the chopper to find the money?
good idea .
but then ... ... without a pilot ... ... nobody even gets off this mountain .
what are you doing , eric?
do you know what real love is?
no .
sacrifice .
now i'm the only one who can fly us out of here .
now take your toy and find our money .
radio when you find it .
i'm waiting here .
the last one is at crockett river .
we take the northern ridge .
i'm going to take the north trail and you're going back for help .
are you crazy?
if they find the case , hal's dead .
where are the choppers?
they had a mechanical problem .
their eta is one hour .
you've got to do better than that .
stop there .
we're close .
i've locked in .
i'd say we've finished with him .
yeah , but do it quietly .
your insane boss has already made enough noise .
it's been fun .
you're an asshole .
and you're a loud mouthed , punk slag who's about to die .
maybe .
but in a minute i'll be dead , and you will always be an asshole .
go ahead and shoot .
i'm getting cold .
shoot .
who's shooting?
tell me ... do you like soccer?
it's a great sport .
i was a fucking good striker .
here's an outside right .
fuck you !
you're swearing now .
that's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct .
a lovely little chip shot .
he's passed one defender ...
two defenders ...
three defenders ...
the striker lines up for a penalty .
he focuses on the ball .
the crowd is on its feet .
the striker moves to his left .
he draws back his foot .
he comes in .
season's over , asshole .
i said quietly .
enter code
what the fuck is going on?
this is not right .
fuck !
