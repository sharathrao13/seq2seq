sure looks like a lonely place to be , way up there .
if indeed you were , i'd have to disagree .
truth is , when you stop to ponder it , there's really no such thing as a lonely place , ... .. just lonely people .
that's what i believe .
you can be lonely any place : up on a rooftop , at a big family shindig , ... .. in a football stadium , with 60, 000 other humans all around , ... .. or even in a small town , like shelbyville , indiana .
now , i'm not sayin 'there's anything wrong with it .
in fact , loneliness is what ensures the propagation of our species .
i think that's why most people get married .
because they're lonely , horny or out of money .
but mostly cos they're just damn lonely .
of course , that is one hell of a milk toast reason ... .. to link up with one person for the rest of your existence .
but people do it every day .
they give in to their loneliness .
and the next thing they know , they're trapped .
perhaps i'm being too picky .
i talked to this counsellor once .
he told me that the fact i was raised in an orphanage ... .. has rendered me afraid of abandonment , and therefore fearful of commitment .
now , you can tell by my tone , i don't think much of his opinion .
i'm ready to commit , just as soon as i find that one woman i can't live without .
that one woman that gives me goose bumps all over .
i simply refuse to settle for anything less , like most people seem to do .
like my boss , larry .
be a sport , will ya?
i missed ruthie's birthday dinner last night and she's makin 'my life hell in a handbasket .
i know she'll go easier on me if you're there .
come on now , gilly .
do me this .
bring her a puppy , larry .
she'll love that .
what the hell is this?
it's a russian pomeranian , larry .
nah , i don't wanna put any american dogs outta work .
come on now , gilly .
be a friend .
come on over .
i don't know , larry .
last time i ...
thanks , buddy .
a slice of family life and home cookin 'will do your heart good .
bring some wine coolers .
we'll make it a wingding .
this is fine cuisine , mrs p.
it's takeout , gilly .
from pizza hut .
larry hates my cooking .
that's not true , ruthie .
you know i ...
that's why he never comes home for dinner .
i'm out there busting my ass .
if you're busting your ass , how come it's the size of a goddamn beanbag chair?
if you put out once in a while , maybe i wouldn't be seeking carnal pleasure in food .
all right !
call me old fashioned , ... .. but i don't think a child should be made to picture her parents humping .
i don't tell you about my sex life .
you're not having sex .
are you having sex?
cher , tell daddy you're kidding .
she's kidding .
she doesn't even have a boyfriend .
you don't need to have a boyfriend to be having sex .
i'm just saying that a boy doesn't have to be a friend to be nibbling my package .
what? !
are you ...?
i think she's saying she's a whore , pop .
buddy !
pervert !
i am not .
i'm just popular .
like gilly here .
he doesn't have a girlfriend , but i'll bet he's having sex .
well , occasionally , sure , but ...
well , ultimately i believe in waiting till one is married before ...
how come you don't have a girlfriend?
dad says you're confused about your sexuality .
no , i never said that .
i believe the term he used was " fagnostic " .
right .
fagnostic .
larry !
that's it !
go to your room , you two !
what?
why?
she's just repeating what you said .
you always take her side !
you let her get her ears pierced .
you try to stop her !
i got my ears pierced because i like it , ok?
and i got these pierced because i hate you !
hey , that was you on the lnternet !
i am sick of bein 'treated like dirty bath water .
i chase poodles all day so she can drive around in a brand new saturn .
fully loaded !
the usual , hon .
this kinda thing makes a man wanna bludgeon his family and get drunk .
that's pretty serious talk , larry .
maybe you should speak to a professional about this .
you mean a hit man?
no , man .
that's the easiest way to get caught .
unless you did it .
i was talkin 'about a shrink , larry .
get real , man .
that's for crazy people .
hey , maggots .
hey , stewart .
what the hell happened to your hair?
you like it?
i just got it cut ... .. by the most beautiful woman on the face of god's green earth .
looks pretty weird .
yeah , thanks .
she called it a european cut .
says it draws attention away from my ears .
what'd she use?
a fuckin 'chisel?
who the hell cares?
i tell you , she's well worth the price of a hat .
she's new , over at mega kutz .
i can't trust the opinion of a guy who scrapes up road kill for a living .
you can trust me with this one .
man , she got the face of an angel .
just gives you goose bumps all over , you know?
i've been searchin 'for you at the wrong times
and i just can't win
but i try
to find you
i try
to find you
you have left the most beautiful hand print
i am meltin 'away
you have left the most beautiful hand print
i ...
i melt away
like it?
who's next?
uh , right here .
come here .
so how do you like it?
oh , you know , just ...
just like it is , only not quite so long .
so you want it shorter , then?
yeah , shorter .
i think shorter's the way to go .
so you cut a lot of hair?
i guess so .
i mean , i've been working here a month or so , ever since i moved back .
oh , so you're not from ...
uh , where are you from?
oh , i'm from here .
i was livin 'in oregon for a while .
beaver , oregon .
but then i moved back because i had to help out with my daddy .
he had stroke number two and he's paralysed now , so ...
ow !
that's a ... shame .
it truly is .
well , it's his own damn fault .
he's so tense all the time .
it's like he's got fire ants runnin 'through his veins .
oh , i'm sorry !
how's that , um ...?
i'm sorry .
what did you say your name was?
actually , i didn't .
it's gilly .
ok , gilly .
i'm jo .
could you hold that there for me?
how's that for length?
beautiful .
so i see you have a cat .
well , i had a cat .
he ran away two weeks ago and i haven't heard from him since .
oh , he'll be back .
you know cats .
i've had him since he was a pup .
i don't know what i'd do without my little ringo .
ringo?
that must be a pretty popular name for a cat these days .
it is?
i work down at the animal shelter and i just took in a cat yesterday named ringo .
too bad this ringo's missin 'a tail .
that's my cat !
aargh !
hey , watch the corner !
yeah , yeah .
she said put him in er 4 .
gilly !
are you ok?
were they able to sew it back on?
no , but they tell me i'm first in line for an ear donor .
you lying sack !
well , listen .
what are you doin 'tonight?
just healin ', mostly .
why don't you come over to my house?
i'll cook you dinner and you can bring ringo .
listen , jo .
i don't want you to feel you owe me dinnerjust because i found your cat ...
.. and you cut off my ear .
i do owe you dinner .
just say yes , or else i just might cut off your other ear .
ok .
uh ... 6 . 30?
yeah , 6 . 30's great .
don't worry .
i'm a much better cook than i am a hairstylist .
i just don't know why you're doing this .
doin 'what?
cookin 'dinner for this fella .
you oughta be fixin 'dinner for jack .
the man who wants to marry you , not some dog catcher who makes 18 grand a year ... .. and comes home smellin 'like cat piss every night .
promise me you'll be polite .
of course i'll be polite .
of course i'll be polite .
gosh !
jack called again today .
i talked to him for a long time .
he asked me why you left him .
i wish you would tell him , because i can't make any sense out of it .
are you listening to me?
hold on .
oh , would you ... just put the thing down !
you listen to me now .
good men are few and far between in this world .
when you find yourself a keeper the way i found your sweet pop out there .. then you grab ahold of him and you treat him the way he wants to be treated .
valdine !
what? !
valdine .
valdine !
what is it , gimpy?
i want a beer , goddammit .
now , look .
you curb your language or i'll take this voc a lator 3000 right back to wal mart .
you hear me?
jeez !
what in the name of god ...?
i was watchin 'that .
yeah , i bet you were .
you've just had a stroke .
do you want another one?
i want you to stay calm .
get me a goddamn beer .
gilly !
ringo !
all the dogs at the animal shelter chipped in for a little going away present .
well , thank them for me , and thank you .
just doin 'my job .
how's your ear?
it's ok .
i got all the pus drained out of it .
close the goddamn door .
you have a robot?
daddy , i'd like you to meet gilly noble .
it's a pleasure to meet you , mr wingfield .
he's a little shy around strangers .
i'm gonna get ringo some half and half .
ok .
so ...
oh , golf , huh?
it seems every time i play , i get tourette's syndrome .
you know ...
fore !
shit , damn , crap .
fore !
shit , damn , crap .
hey , dork .
turn it to channel 7 , dipshit .
whoa .
you can say " dipshit " with that thing .
that's neat .
come on , have some more .
you probably don't eat this well very often on your salary .
mama , leave him alone .
aw , that's ok , jo .
i'll find room .
so , willy , what do they pay you down there for gassin 'strays?
no , ma'am , i don't gas them .
what do you do?
hit 'em with a bat?
no , i meant i'm not the one who actually puts them to sleep .
i , uh ...
i couldn't do that .
and as for the pay , it's not much , but it plays into my long term career goal .
which is?
i wanna be a veterinarian .
you'd be a great vet .
doctor noble .
thanks , but it's not gonna be easy .
four more years at the junior college and i'll have my two year degree .
and then i'll transfer over to state , and with a ba in general studies ... .. i should be able to get into any vet school in mexico .
sounds foolproof
if gilly says he's gonna be a vet , then i believe he's gonna be a vet .
excuse me a minute .
care for a taste of my pie?
no , thanks .
i'm full .
suit yourself .
i'm gonna have a slice .
easy on the corns , dr dolittle .
the lord , ... .. our lord , ... .. has blessed me with the divine gifts of tracking , finding and retrieving .
come on , vic .
just tell me what you have so far .
i'll tell you what i got .
now , i'm about 90 per cent on this .
but i believe that your birth mother is still alive and living somewhere in the local area .
and her name is ... .. suki yamaguchi .
that sounds a little , um , ... .. japanese y to me .
this detective , vic vetter , is lookin 'for my family .
but so far , no luck .
what if you find out you're the son of the guy who invented shoe polish?
you'd be rich .
i wouldn't care if he just shined shoes for a living .
not havin 'a family's left a big , empty space inside of me .
it's really important that i find them .
you will .
this is the first time i've ever been up here with anyone .
you don't like it up here , do you?
no , no , it's fine .
it's fine .
just being here reminds me of a bad time .
i was seven and we had to put our dog humpy to sleep .
i still haven't gotten over it .
it's ridiculous , i know .
no , that's not ridiculous at all .
every friday i see animals being put to sleep here ... .. and i wish that i could take 'em all home with me , but i can't .
and every time one of those animals dies , i feel like a part of me dies too .
about a year ago , i wrote this poem that i recite to all the dogs before they go .
it helps me and ...
i like to think it helps them too .
i'd love to hear it .
no , it's not very good .
i don't care .
ok .
o noble creature
the time has come
for the two of us to part
and for you to go to a better place
a place deep inside my heart
a place where you'll be free to run
after a car or a bouncing ball
so go , noble creature
through that doggy door
and fetch a stick that's thrown by god
and wag thy tail for ever more
while a friendly voice repeats
good dog , good dog .
so that's it .
and after i read it , ... .. i usually fire off a one gun salute with a pistol we keep here at the shelter .
i know it sounds silly , but ...
it doesn't sound silly .
when the daylight's gone
and you're on your own
and you need a friend
just to be around
i will comfort you
i will take your hand
and i'll pull you through
i will understand
and you know that i'll be at your side
there's no need to worry
together we'll survive
through the haste and hurry
i'll be at your side
when you feel like you're alone
or you've nowhere to turn
help .
very funny .
if life's standing still
and your soul's confused
and you cannot find
what road to choose
and you know that i'll be at your side
this is a great day .
it was a good idea .
shall we have the champagne?
no , uh ...
let's wait till later .
you know , the day i cut your ear off , ... .. i never dreamed we'd be spending six months together .
yeah , that is pretty funny .
i've had such a good time with you , just hanging out , having fun .
no strings attached .
most guys are so possessive .
you know , they talk about marriage before the first year is even up .
there was this one schmuck , he actually went out and he got a plane and a banner .
it was so lame !
talk about pressure .
i'd love to , gilly .
love to what?
i'd love to marry you .
that's my uncle joe's plane up there .
joseph wingfield ... is your uncle .
i'm named after him .
you know , it probably should have occurred to me .
should i just keep rollin '
all over this town
boy , you don't quit , do ya?
oh , that's it .
that's the spot .
oh , don't go back there !
we gotta save some for the honeymoon .
what are you sayin ', gilly?
nothin '.
i was just ... messin 'around with ringo .
hey , jo .
who's jack?
what jack?
you know .
on your ass jack .
well , he's my ex boyfriend from oregon .
i've been meaning to get it removed .
you're notjealous , are you?
you're the one with the half naked suzanne somers over his bed .
come on .
now don't bad mouth suzanne .
she got me through my awkward teenage years .
do you mean you beat off to her?
not to brag , but ... up to five times a day .
wow .
do you wanna try to break that record?
hey , it's gilly .
leave a message .
hey , noble .
it's vic .
i know it's early , but are you there , buddy?
pick up .
i got a package in the mail .
i love you , jo .
surprise !
i found your mother .
i love you , gilly .
i touched all the bases on this one .
i'm 110 per cent sure .
your mother's name is valdine wingfield .
wingfield .
you gotta understand .
i had just had little jo and we were strapped for cash ... .. and then i found out i was pregnant again ... with you !
old r2 d2 couldn't keep it in his pants back then ... .. and now he can't even wipe his own ass !
i just didn't know how i was gonna feed everybody and you were such a hungry child !
i figured the best thing to do was to give you away .
you know , to somebody who wouldn't resent you for your burden .
i mean , one of you had to go and jo was already house broke .
this can't be happening .
i know how difficult this must be for you .
but think how lucky you are that you found out before it was too late , ... .. before you got married and consummated this forbidden relationship .
sweet lord !
you ponied your sister .
oh , my god .
hey , maggot .
what are you doin 'out here?
nothin '.
what you got there?
well , i'd say cougar .
what do you think , wingfield?
it's a coyote , stewart .
there are no cougars in indiana .
hell , i'm talkin 'about the car .
looks like cougar tread .
i used to work in a tyre store , you know .
yeah?
well , i used to work at the animal shelter .
hey , gilly , you know i had no choice .
know how it feels when newspapers call you the boss of a sister fucker?
whole damn town thinks i'm runnin 'a sister fuckeria .
coulda stuck by me , larry .
it was gonna blow over .
come on , gilly .
who are you shittin '?
not that i blame you .
i mean , if i had a sister that looked like that ... whoa !
wham bam thank you sis !
you're right about that .
you know , i'd say , sister or no , i'd still like to get a crack at her .
that is , if she ever comes back .
is she still up in oregon?
as far as i know .
all right , maggots !
chop chop !
dearest gilly , i'm sorry i left without saying goodbye .
i just couldn't face you after all that's happened .
the feelings that once seemed so right became in an instant so wrong .
though it pains me to say it , we must never see each other again .
and though we must never forget the love we shared , ... .. we must , like noble creatures , move on to another plane .
valdine?
valdine !
what?
i'm busy .
put lots of salt on that sandwich .
you want a lot of salt?
yes .
here you are , honey .
nice and salty .
thank you .
hey , gilly .
how was your day at work?
i don't know .
it was pretty slow .
just snakes , mostly .
well , dinner's almost ready .
i made that nice chicken thing you like .
hey , dad .
i thought you were gonna get a haircut .
now , walter , hush .
gilly's been through a lot .
includin 'his own sister .
i'd better get it .
hello?
hi , honey .
how are you?
how's jack?
good , good .
oh , he's fine .
he's been through a lot , but he's hanging in there .
i know you miss him .
but guess what .
he's regained the use of both of his arms now .
both of 'em .
you know , they move every which way .
all right .
ok , well , what is it?
you're getting married?
oh , jo jo , that is so wonderful !
it's jo jo .
she and jack are getting married !
oh , my god .
isn't that wonderful?
sweetheart , i am really , really happy for you .
i am .
ok , sure .
i'll talk to you tomorrow .
bye bye .
yes !
yes !
sweet jesus !
the wingfields have arrived !
uh huh , uh huh , uh huh , ... .. i'm rich , i'm rich , uh huh ...
talkin 'to ya , mama !
oh , yeah !
pervert !
gilly , how's your sister?
jo knew you'd understand why she couldn't possibly invite you .
i know .
i think you should be happy for your sister .
oh , hell .
after what you put her through , ... .. it's a wonder she didn't quit the sausage and become a vagina tarian .
oh , good god .
gilly , listen .
things are really looking up for her .
she's got a little beauty parlour up there and a guy who's crazy about her ... .. and , quite frankly , a millionaire several times over .
quit babying the boy , valdine .
he banged his own sister , for christ's sakes .
what do you want?
to give him a medal?
listen to me .
this could be a whole new start for us all , so i want you to keep your chin up .
do you know what the bible says about fuckin 'your own sister?
don't !
hush up , droopy .
he's my baby , my precious gift from god .
i'll get it .
i baked you some ginger snaps .
they're cooling on the stove .
what do you want?
sorry to bother you , mrs wingfield .
my name is leon pitofsky .
oh , my god .
did i come at a bad time?
no .
it's just ... you look remarkably like my dear husband when he was a much younger man .
well , that stands to reason , ma'am .
look at this .
it's all there .
blood tests , hospital records , dna .
look .
here's your signature , givin 'up your rights to me .
oh , my lord .
then it's true .
you are my son .
i've finally found you , mama !
well , if he's your son , then who the hell's this sack of shit?
i'll tell you who he is .
he's a grifter .
he's a shyster that's been freeloading in this house for a solid year !
oh , wait .
mom ...
i knew it !
get outta my house , you goddamn hippie !
hippie?
whoa , hold on .
walter , get that impostor outta here .
dad , relax .
hey , buddy , you heard my mama .

boy , that is a hell of a thing for you to say to me .
well , in all fairness , you were in the middle of the road .
how else was i supposed to flag you down?
i was a desperate man .
another 20 minutes and them bloodthirsty mosquitoes woulda sucked me dry .
how long have you been out here?
oh , about two hours .
my airplane ran outta gas .
i had to land in a clearing .
you're a pilot?
you're goddamn right i'm a pilot .
my card , right there .
" the big dig "?
that's right .
dig mccaffrey .
i make a lotta coin flyin 'those gigs nobody else wants .

i'll fly up your ass if the money's right .
hey , that's pretty good .
do you think i oughta put that on my card?
so where am i takin 'you?

and a man as sexy and fertile as me likes to stay close to the beaver .
that's a good one !
that's right where i'm headed .
say , you look like you're draggin 'there , chief .
why don't you let me drive?
oh , no , that's fine .

i'm from indiana .
you remind me of a fella i knew ... .. down in el paso durin 'my import export days .

how did you know that i was ...?
dig knows many things , baby .
plus you got that look of a man with a diamond engagement ring on his pinkie .
oh , yeah .
about a year ago , she was the love of my life .
then i found out she was my sister .
then , about three days ago ...
dig !
dig !
just a little case of the white line fever , that's all , baby !
dig just needs a little music .
rock and roll , baby !
i'd like to see somebody fall asleep to this shit here ...
ted nugent !

the invitation's there
i come alone and i'm drivin 'home
well , before we depart , ... .. i want you to know two things , el paso .
i am one eighth chippewa indian .
and when you save the life of a chippewa , it must be paid back tenfold .
i owe you big time .
that's not necessary , but thank you .
no , no , no .
heap big .
heap big , daddy .
i appreciate everything you done for me .
i do .
what was the other thing?
hm?
you said you wanted me to know two things .
no , i don't think i said that .
i was sayin '...
oh , yeah .
when you find that sister of yours , you get outta this town , asap .
some spooky cats around here .
what kinda spooky cats?
the kind with money and power .
that sounds like the kinda guy jo is with .
well , good luck flippin 'that coin , daddy .
i'll see you later , el paso .
oh , dig .
thanks for not suing me .
a pleasure bein 'hit by a man of your calibre .
beaver police .
yes .
my name is valdine wingfield .
i'm calling from shelbyville , indiana .
i'd like to report a sexual predator .
his name is gilbert noble .
he assaulted his own sister .
he's still very dangerous and he's on his way to beaver this very minute .
his own sister , huh?
you know , i didn't know jo wingfield had a brother .
isn't that sweet?
do you have a description of the pervert?
i can do better than that .
i have his mug shot , taken last year when he was arrested protesting for animal rights .
sounds like a bad apple .
that's great .
why don't you fax that over?
listen .
i'd rather this didn't get back to jo .
she and jack have so much on their minds , what with the big wedding .
i'd appreciate you being discreet about this .
absolutely , ma'am .
beaver police are known for their discretion .
comfortable , mrs hartunian?
yeah .
how you doin '?
how's your family?
fine .
would you like the standard bikini wax?
no .
i'm goin 'to hawaii with my husband .
better landscape the whole yard .
so ... do you ever miss cutting hair , jo?
no , not really .
i mean , my heart wasn't into it , like it is with bikini waxing .
i guess you could say that some people are cutters and some people are yankers .
i was just born to yank .
gilly?
mama , how could you not have told me he was coming?
i'm sorry , baby .
i know i should have .
i just kept praying he'd come to his senses and get over it .
poor , crazy guy .
crazy?
what do you mean , crazy?
oh , jo .
i hate to tell you this .
your brother gilly now has an imaginary friend .
leon .
he's been going all over town and telling everybody he's not your brother , ... .. but this fellow leon is .
poor gilly .
don't you worry about him .
your mama has enough love and compassion for that wounded bird .
i guess i should worry about how to break this to jack .
you can't tell jack .
it would break the poor man's heart .
rich .
hey , rich , wake up .
oh .
hi , jack .
i want you to go on over to the hotel .
tell chaney i sent you .
he'll put it on my account .
i don't wanna take your money .
i'll tell you somethin '.
i got my business and most of my money from my father .
the least i can do is to give something back .
no , i'll be fine , jack .
i just need another ten minutes .
no , come on .
you do as i say , all right?

you know , like old times .
oh , gina , i'd love to .
yeah?
but , as you know , ... .. i'm engaged to be married this week .
i'd hate to embarrass my bride to be .

jack mitchelson got millions from his daddy .
he's what we call a multimillionaire .
and , in my experience , women like dead presidents more than broke boyfriends .
no romance without finance , daddy .
hey , jo's not like that .
shit .
love may be blind , but it can still smell that money , baby .
not to mention ... there's a lotta cash in sellin 'grass .
what does that mean?
hey , sherlock .
jack mitchelson is the biggest marijuana grower in the pacific northwest .
you are not seein 'the forest for the weed here , man .
this dude's a pot grower , a reefer salesman , a doobie doctor .
that's why jack keeps beaver squeaky clean : to keep johnny law from sniffin 'around .
how does he get away with it?
half the town's on the payroll .
the rest ... scared to death of that wombat .
man !
we've gotta figure out a way to get jo outta there .
amen to that .

sorry to bother you , jack .
mrs mitchelson , i'm afraid we have some ... bad news .
your brother gilly .
there's been an accident .
his truck ... blew up .
body was burned beyond recognition , ma'am .
by the time we got to the scene , coyotes had torn off some of the major body parts .
they even ate his ...
gina !
i think that's enough description of the deceased for right now .
okey dokey .
are you sure?
are you sure that it was gilly?
we found this ring on his finger bone , with your names inscribed on it .
i scooped up what i could .
ashes , mostly .
put 'em in my thermos .
thought you might like to keep 'em for a remembrance .
he killed himself .
i know it !
it's all my fault .
no , that is not true , ma'am .
your brother is in that thermos on account of a fella i have in custody here .
all right , boys .
bring him out .
leon?
did you say " leon "?
mama !
i was just followin 'him !
it was an accident !
i didn't mean to bump his car , and then it exploded .
he's your brother , jo .
walter !
your real brother .
daddy?
we hid the truth from you ... .. because valdine wanted a crack at jack's money ... .. and , lord help me , so did i.
so are you sayin 'that gilly was never my brother?
how could you do that to me?
we did it for your own good .
he was a dog catcher .
you're crazy !
you're just crazy , ok?
i'm sorry , jack .
no .
i'm just very confused right now .
no , don't apologise to him .
he set the whole thing up .
that's a lie !
ask him if the name vic vetter rings a bell .
shut up , walter .
jack sent vic false information about gilly .
you tell her , valdine .
you tell her the truth .
what are you talkin 'about?
you're sick !
you're fucking sick !
i hope you all make one big happy family .
just don't include me .
walter , you goddamn idiot !
look at you !
she deserves a better life .
how dare you ruin my wedding?
blow me .
you did this !
i'm gonna kill you !
son of a bitch !
i'm gonna kill you !
mama !
mom !
ma'am !
mama?
gina , better call them ambulance boys .

the time has come
for the two of us to part
and for you to go to a better place
a place deep inside my heart

and all the time moves on and on
and all i know is it's wrong , it's wrong
and all i know is it's wrong , it's wrong

i've been lookin 'for you on the outside
you've been stayin 'in
i've been searchin 'for you at the wrong times
and i just can't win
but i try
to find you
i try
to find you
you have left the most beautiful hand print
i am meltin 'away
you have left the most beautiful hand print

i'll be singin 'your praises on stages
will you be talkin 'mine?
i'll be fillin 'my diary pages
about a love divine
that shines
on down
that shines
on down
you have left the most beautiful hand print
i am meltin 'away
you have left the most beautiful hand print
i ... melt away
