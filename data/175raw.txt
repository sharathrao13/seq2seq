the guy doesn't have a tongue .

he has no tongue?
why don't i just leave that little detail out for now .
no big deal , right?

no , i'm just saying .
i saved a life today .
what the hell did you do?
all right , let it go .
no , no .
i know what i heard .
all right .
those people who don't belong here , get them out of here .
make sure this place is secure .
a drunk hangs out in a neighborhood bar , passes out enough times , people would know where he lived from carrying him home .
i mean , it's one thing i know .

oh , it took years of research .
this must be it .
what do you want to bet it's rent controlled?
well , i don't think this is paint .
a real art buff .

how the hell did you two find this place?
lucky guess .
so what did you fiind out?
his name's thomas aquinas .
he's a priest .
why don't you tell us something we don't know?
a homicidal priest .
that's good .
yeah? well , it gets better .
he studied at the vatican .
he was one of their alleged visionaries .
came here in '81 to st. john's church downtown .
six months ago , he disappeared .
priests there say he was having a spiritual crisis .
oh , yeah .
that's what this is about .
spiritual crisis .
doesn't make any sense .
what's a priest doing shooting at a wall street banker?
a wall street banker , by the way , who suddenly disappeared .
maybe we should ask the girl .

christine , listen to me .
we've been over this before .
it's a terrible thing to lose your parents .
i know it was a long time ago .
the holidays always make something like that feel much worse .
understand , these dreams are your creation .
there's nothing real about them .
you control them .
they don't control you .
take another xanax to relieve your anxiety .
you are fine .
trust me .
another vision?
why didn't you tell me?
i didn't want you to worry . i'm your step mother . it's my job to worry .
no big deal , really . just someone on the subway car turned into porcelain and shattered .
what's wrong with me?
why do i see things?
why am i so different?
oh , you don't know how special you are .
you're better than everybody else .
just remember that .
i don't want to be better or worse .
i want to be normal .
i want a normal life .
you have to have patience .
all good things will come to you .
you'll see .
oh , excuse me .
i'm sorry , we're closed .
i would like to talk to you about thomas aquinas .
father , please , i need you down stairs .
just take these .
father , please .
go .
i've already told the police .
thomas was a friend of mine and a colleague .
he had nothing to do with what happened today .
there was no one else on that fire escape .
you don't understand .
i understand getting shot at , and i don't like it .
he shot at you?
no , he shot at my client .
i happened to get in the way .
who's your client?
that's irrelevant right now .
what i want to know is why would a priest try to kill someone?
you've been drinking .
i've got 14 years sober , and i can spot that .
well , good for you .
your friend and colleague , was he working for someone?
yes , he was working for god .
so god ordered a hit on an investment banker?
there's a lot that you don't know .
you think you've seen everything?
you haven't .
there are things you never dreamed of .
there's another world out there .
thomas saw it , and it destroyed him .
i've seen a lot too , but there's nothing that would make me cut my tongue out .
yeah , well , wait a few days . what happens in a few days?
did thomas tell you about a girl?
no .
i see .
do you believe in god?
maybe once , but not anymore . what happened?
we had a difference of opinion .
i thought that my wife and daughter should live , and he felt otherwise .
i'm sorry to hear about the loss .
maybe it's time for you to renew your faith .
this girl .
is she in trouble?
does she need help?
i have a lot ofthings to do here .
excuse me .
excuse me .
i have more questions , if you don't mind .
i've got a question for you .
if you don't believe in god , how can you understand his adversary?
now i have to believe in god in order to solve a crime?
i'm sure that you can fiind your way out .
how many have received the stigmata?
she's the third this week .
what is shesaying?
for your own good , get out and forget what you've seen !
was thomas part of this?
there are forces at work you couldn't possibly comprehend !
now , please , leave !
let nothing you dismay
remember christ
no , it's just i hate the fact that they put finals after the holiday .
it ruins the whole meaning of vacation .
i wouldn't worry .
you always do fine .
besides , a bad grade isn't the end of the world .
besides , a bad grade isn't the end ofthe world .
it's you .
i didn't where is she?
the girl is safe .
and what of the world?
everything is as planned .
our acts go unnoticed , unquestioned .
we're everywhere .
daddy , who is it?
is this your daughter?
yes .
and this is your wife?
yes .
mm .
oh, you insist you gotta talk that shit
you gotta keep that dog ass breath
all up in my face
and i remember when
you would never lie to a friend
'cause you were so high you were so shy
you were so fucked up anyway

what's wrong , baby?
what's wrong?
it was a dream .
he came for me again .
it's only a dream , angel .
it felt closer .
through out the country , the national guard ... has been put on alert as a precaution [ male newscaster ]
mayor giulianiurged all citizens and police ... to stay calm during this holiday season .
no explanations for how blood on the hands of the christ child , depictedin michelangelo's famous sculpture of the pieta [ male newscaster ]
... atmosphere of fear and panic , random acts of violence ... are being attributed to satanic cults who seem determined ... to disrupt new year's celebrations throughout the world .
here in new york
sorry , pal , you can't come in here .
ahh .
the young boys that you seduced have left their scent upon you .
remember who it is that you serve .
hmm?
open your eyes , thomas .
look .
look at the face that has haunted your dreams for a thousand years .
they say you can see the future , thomas .
then you must know exactly what i'm going to do to you .
i don't know what we hope to get from this guy .
he's got no fuckin 'tongue .
he can write .
fuck me .
there is still no explanation ... for the devastating explosions that rocked midtown two nights ago .
in the wake of tuesday night's explosion , investigators from the new york city fire department are still at a loss to explain ... why the restaurant suddenly burst into flames , killing at least 35 people .
hey , asshole , watch where you're going .
hey , i like the shirt .
screw you , man !
hey , kid .
nice shirt .
i'm tellin'you , no one entered the room .
maybe he did it himself .
then how did he get the last scalpel in !
oh , my god .
it just keeps getting better .
i've never seen anything like this .
when the thousand years has ended ,
satan shall be loosed out of his prison .
uh , this next part is not clear .
i i i think it's in english .
it says , " christ
christ in new york .
christ !
well , it's offiicial .
i'm never sleeping again , ever .
you okay?
a guy cuts words into his chest .
someone else nails him to the ceiling .
what's not okay?
so where we going?
the girl .
i gotta talk to her , find out what she knows .
w w wait .
we don't have a name .
that would help .
maybe we do .
maybe it's not " christ in new york .
maybe it's , " chris in new york , " " christine in new york .
christine york . " let's run a d. m. v. check and find out if any of those names come up .
hello , christine york .
sometimes you border on competent .
i know .
it's scary , isn't it?
christine?
mabel called .
she'd like you to get dressed and join her for lunch .
grazie , carson .
no !
shit !
no !
no !
ahhh !
goddamn it , get off me !
go downstairs and watch the front door !
please !
help !
there is no sanctuary but heaven .
you must go there now .
what are you doing?
i commend you to almighty god and entrust you [ bobby ]
at what point is this considered ... interfering with a police investigation?
hey , we are private citizens having a conversation with another citizen .
i mean , i don't think they've found a way to outlaw that .
at least not yet .
please !
no !
may you return to him who formed
go down there .
do whatever you can .
i need more time to finish the last rites .
may christ , the true shepherd [ christine ]
help !
stairs .
covered .
help !
may you see your redeemer
... forever , amen .
son of a bitch !
you all right?
yeah .
check the body down the stairs .
what body?
call the police , and get an ambulance .
take it easy .
we're the good guys .
all right?
what happened?
carson .
those men th those men
they tried to kill me .
why?
eight jets , variable speed .
that's what i call dying in style .
what kind of girl lives in a house like this , anyway?
oh , she's an orphan .
both parents deceased .
after the mother died , the home nurse married the father .
now the nurse is the sole guardian .
i think it's adorable the way you talk like a real cop .
yeah?
so you think after they clean up this mess , we could ... [ marge ]
don't tempt me . soak a little?
they relax me .
you want one?
oh , no , thanks .
i drink .
my little girl had one just like it .
really?
mm hmm .
yeah?
you snoop through her stuff without asking too?
when i was looking for something .
what are you looking for?
a connection .
most days , i don't feel connected to anyone .
i noticed a lot of religious books outside .
mm .
they're my stepmother's .
is she a big believer?
no , not really .
it's mostly just kind of like a hobby with her .
do you know a priest by the name of thomas aquinas?
no .
is that your connection , religion?
i've seen a lot of attempted murders , but i've never seen anyone perform the last rites before .
christine?
in here !
are you all right?
oh , my god , i just heard what happened !
did they hurt you?
i'm okay , but carson
i know .
oh .
i'm just so glad you came along when you did .
thanks .
i didn't realize you knew where the library was , let alone had a card .
well , there's a lot about me you don't know .
they're right outside .
you must bring her .
he is waiting for her .
no , that's impossible !
they'll follow me and find the temple !
i couldn't convince her to come here .
yuck !
then i shall have to go to her .
did i mention i had a date tonight?
not just the inflatable kind .
a real live girl .
did you break up with the inflatable one?
yeah .
she was just too needy .
everything was about her .
it's just that this is starting to feel a lot like work .
normally , i wouldn't mind work because , well, you know , we'd be getting paid .
watching rich people for free .
it just seems odd , doesn't it?
okay , i'll wait here .
change your mind about the pill?
i found something .
christine , what are you doing? why is that man here?
i'll be five minutes .
she loves me to death , but she's a little overprotective .
i took this from one of your attackers .
did you show that to the police?
no .
if i did , it would end up in a plastic envelope on one of their large shelves .
that's pretty cynical . well , i've put a few of those envelopes ... up on that large shelf myself .
i used to be a cop .
now , this amulet is from a masonic order ... in a former sub herald ofthe vatican knights .
the knights of the holy see .
they await the return of the dark angel to earth .
so , the men that attacked me are devil worshippers?
no .
this says they're the good guys .
they're the ones that are supposed to stop the devil worshippers .
those were the good guys?
what does that have to do with me?
those were the good guys?
what does that have to do with me?
i'm sorry .
i have a medical condition .
sometimes i see things that aren't there .
no .
i saw it too .
i've been having visions ever since i can remember , but i've never shared one before .
there must be an explanation .
i hope so .
i've been waiting all my life to hear it .
let's get out of here !
come on !
you're not going anywhere .
what are you doing?
there's no time to discuss this .
after all these years of waiting , it's finally happening .
what's happening?
you can't run away now !
stop it !
let her go !
no !
don't you love me?
didn't i give you everything?
haven't i been a mother to you?
no o o !
christine .
you know who i am .
oh , no .
i've come for you .
let's go .
come on .
you only had one simple job , and you couldn't even do that .
hey , marge?
marge , over here ! we need your help !
easy with the hardware .
jesus , marge ! what the fuck?
it's okay , jer .
we just want the girl .
okay , tell me .
what the hell is going on here?
i don't know .
i don't believe you .
all right .
i'm coming out .
throw out the gun .
please don't don't leave me here .
please !
hands on your head .
what?
hands on your head .
now !
what do you want with her , marge?
huh? why is she so important? just the girl .
you can kill him .
come on !
quickly !
you , i don't need .
but you
call your people .
find them .
over here .
goddamn it !
get up !
come on .
get up !
my best friend is dead .
everyone is trying to kill us .
i just shot two cops .
why is everyone after you?
i don't know .
i swear .
i don't know . why is this happening? i know it's my fault . i just don't know why .
that man on the stairs , what do you know about him?
nothing .
come on .
i saw your face .
you recognized him .
i don't talk about it .
tell me .
i need to know .
i've seen him before ... in my dreams .
in your dreams?
they're they're nightmares really .
he takes me , and and he makes love to me .
i've been making love to him my whole life .
i thought i was crazy , but he was never real before tonight .
oh , he's real .
i've seen him before .
i'm afraid .
don't be afraid .
i won't let him do any harm to you .
i'm afraid of me .
i'm afraid that if i see him , if he tries to take me ,
i'm gonna want him to .
let's go !
where we going?
to get some answers .
you don't need that .
you have no enemies here .
i'm not so sure about that .
this girl was just attacked by your people .
your vatican knights almost killed her !
vatican knights?
oh , my god .
well , they're not my people .
they think they're doing god's work .
but they're not .
i want to know what's going on , and i want to know right now !
put the gun away .
did anybody see you come?
no .
good .
we should be safe here .
according to the scriptures , he can't see inside of the house of god .
who can't?
maybe now you're ready to believe .
her hands are healed .
that's the power of faith .
who is she?
she's a polish peasant .
she fell into a trance about two weeks ago , and then she began to speak in a language she couldn't possibly have known .
she made a prophecy about end of days .
" end of days "?
of man's destruction and the unholy's reign upon the earth .
why don't you stop all this church talk and tell us what the hell is going on .
who's after her?
well , if you'll excuse me , i'll try to explain .
you know anything about the number of the beast?
revelation of st. john?
from his dream?
six six six?
the number ofthe beast is not six six six .
often in dreams , numbers appear upside down and back wards .
so , six six six becomes nine nine nine .
like in 1 999 , the year of his return .
what does that have to do with me?
the return of satan .
does any of this look familiar to you?
she's been chosen .
he's in her blood .
the holy church has been searching for you since the day you were born .
chosen for what?
every thousand years , on the eve of the millennium , the dark angel comes and takes a body , and then he walks the earth , looking for a woman who will bear his child .
it allhas to happen in that unholyhourbefore midnight on new year's eve .
lf he consummates your flesh with this human body , then he unlocks the gate of hell ... and everything as we know it ceases to exist .
so , the prince of darkness wants to conquer the earth , but has to wait until an hour before midnight of new year's eve?
is this eastern time?
it's got nothing to do with new year's eve .
it has to do with a temporary celestial alignment .
the gregorian monks studied the heavens .
they were able to calculate the precise moment of this event .
they created our calendar by mapping this event ... and counting backwards from that moment .
it was a mistake to come here .
it doesn't matter whether you believe or not .
he's real , and he won't rest till he finds this girl .
why did he pick me?
because the stars were right when you were born .
a man's body was also chosen , just like yours .
lf the devil does exist , why doesn't your god do anything?
it's not my god .
it's our god , and he doesn't say that he will save us .
he says that we will save ourselves .
save myself?
what am i supposed to do?
get a restraining order?
we have to have faith .
faith .
yes , faith . it's an interesting concept .
if you read the bible , you can't miss it .
faith !
between your faith and my glock nine millimeter , i take my glock .
come on .
let's go .
i'm afraid it takes a person of pure heart to defeat pure evil .
you did your job .
you brought her here to people of faith .
we'll protect her .
we'll hide her .
you know , you live in a different world .
we have some real serious problems here , and this is not solving them .
satan's greatest trick was convincing man he didn't exist .
i don't , uh this all feels true to me .
you'll be safer with me .
at least i can fight this guy with something real .
you know what to do .
you feelit .
i'm sorry .
let him go .
it gets easier when you accept what you are .
a fallen soul .
tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk .
door's locked , no windows broken .
how did i get in here?
who the fuck are you?
oh , i think you know who i am .
you just don't want to believe it .
i took a bullet for you .
i protected you .
oh , no no no .
you didn't protect me .
you protected this body .
am i am i getting a pattern here?
so much pain .
not to be taken with alcohol .
remember that .
oh .
to lose a wife and child .
i can't even imagine what that must be like .
what do you want?
to make you happy again .
yuletide carols
beings ungby a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos
a gift from you daughter?
hmm?
amy?
don't stayin there too long .
you'll turn into a prune .
emily !
come on , darling .
it's time to get out .
gotta get you dressed .
your daddy's gonna be home soon .
i have the best daddy in the whole world .
yes , you certainly do .
but i don't think he'll be home .
now , what makes you say a silly thing like that?
he never comes home .
well , honey, you know your daddy workshard .
it's not about how much time you're there .
it's about " quality time .
now , he'll be home just like he promised .
you'll see .
he keeps his promises .
i can give it all back to you .
everything that he took away .
everything .
you can hold your wife again .
you can watch your daughter walk through the door in her prom dress .
all you have to do is tell me where the girl is .
come on .
she's a nobody to you .
you don't even know her .
you're in the middle of something you don't really understand .
you think you're saving her from me?
she wants to be with me .
you know that .
what did you do in school today?
you think i'd harm her?
i'd treat her like a queen .
turn around , sweetheart .
you told me you'do anything to get yourfamily back .
you want them?
this is your chance .
they're not real .
does that matter?
oh , yes . i think you need to be reminded ... of how painful reality is .
no !
oh , shit !
don't hurt my baby !
daddy !
let my daughter go !
daddy !
let go of my baby !
no !
oh , it's true .
it wasn't your fault .
i wasn't there .
no , you were just
you were out doing your job .
i wasn't fucking there !
oh , look at you .
torn apart by guilt .
you didn't do anything wrong .
you were an honest cop .
you didn't take money .
you had to testify against them even after they threatened your family .
most people would never testify against those guys .
they're not like you .
you had to do the right thing .
and where was god , hmm?
he could've stopped it , but he didn't .
he fucked you .
then he made you feel guilty .
me , i don't do guilt .
i didn't do what happened here .
he did .
now you just think about that .
then you tell me who's really your friend .
i can make it like it never happened .
all for the price of a stranger's address .
no !
you will never see the girl !
now , you see now you're upsetting me .
you don't want to see me upset , believe me .
oh , you want to fuck with me?
you think you know bad , huh?
you're a fucking choirboy compared to me !
a choirboy !
you're in touch with your anger .
i really like that .
i don't know about you , but i'm going to have a drink .
you and i are so much alike .
we're nothing alike !
nothing !
look at yourself .
look at this .
look at what you are now .
you walked away from the light , just like me .
you want one?
you need to get out , now .
come on .
you know what's in your heart .
we're on the same side .
i'm not on your side , and i never will be .
you're on his side?
he's the one who took away your family .
let me tell you something about him .
he is the biggest underachiever of all time .
he just had a good publicist , that's all .
it's his will .
he moves in mysterious ways .
you take that that overblown press kit they call the bible .
you look for the answer in there , what do they tell you?
shit happens .
please .
he treated you like garbage .
you walked away .
i'm not the bad guy .
what about the end of days?
think of it as a new beginning .
a change of management .
and you'll be right there with me on the ground floor .
it will be so cool .
tell me what you want .
tell me what you really want , and i'll give it to you .
i'll tell you what i want .
i want you to go to hell .
you see , sometimes the problem is ... [ neck bones cracking ] hell ...
comes to you !
don't fuck up the coat .
i've wasted too much time on this .
you see those insignifiicant little dots down there?
huh?
do you see them?
that's what you mean to me .
now , give me the girl !
not today .
look down .
now , look in your heart and tell me you don't want to die .
all you got to do is take my hand .
and i'll give you back everything that he took away .
come on .

she is only one life .
how many lives are you prepared to end if we do nothing?
that's not who we are .

we are preventing the end of days .
but you can't prevent evil by doing evil .
there is no time !
no !
it's the only way .
no o o !
may god forgive us !
amen .
i can do this all day long .
now , let her go .

lf she is slain , his hope of creating a kingdom on earth dies with her .
her death is god's will .
it's not god's will .
it's your will , and it will lead to our destruction .
