they will say that i have shed innocent blood .
what's blood for , if not for shedding?
with my hook for a hand ... ... l'll split you from your groin to your gullet .
i came ... ... for you .
this is the scariest story i've ever heard , and it's true .
it was a few years ago , near moses lake in lndiana .
clara was babysitting for the johnsons .
billy pulls up on his motorcycle .
she wasn't dating billy .
she'd been dating michael for 6 months .
but she always had the hots for billy ... ... because he was , like , a bad boy and michael was ... ... just so nice .
so anyway , she decides that tonight's the night ... ... she'll give billy what she never gave michael .
ever heard of candyman?
his right hand is sawn off .
he has a hook jammed in the bloody stump .
and if you look in the mirror and you say his name five times ... ... he'll appear behind you , breathing down your neck .
do you wanna try it?
so billy began .
candyman .
candyman .
candyman .
candyman .
no one ever got past four .
not here .
go downstairs .
i have a surprise .
she looked in the mirror .
and i don't know why ... ... but she said it the last time .
candyman .
she turned out the lights .
what he saw turned his hair white .
killed her .
split her open with his hook , and then killed the baby too .
and billy got away ... ... but soon after , he went crazy .
my roommate's boyfriend knows him .
so when did you first hear this story?
my friend heard it on the radio .
it's true .
the babysitter roasted the kid like it was a turkey .
so what's the deal?
you guys doing a page on serial killers?
something like that .
that's it .
we're done .
thanks .
no problem .
see ya .
see ya .
seems they're getting younger everyday .
remember the baby alligator craze?
when they got too big , they were flushed down the toilet .
they live in the sewers now .
some of them are 30 feet long .
where did this happen?
in miami .
they went blind and albino from living in the dark .
it wasn't miami .
it was new york .
i read it in the paper .
well , then it must be true .
why would danny and diane both be suffering from the same delusion ... ... in two cities over 1 000 miles apart?
let's face it , folks .
there are no alligators ... ... in the sewers .
no , it's round the campfire .
it's bedtime stories .
see , these stories are ... ... modern oral folklore ... ... the unselfconscious reflection of the fears of urban society .
that's lunch .
the dashing professor !
the lovely wife .
helen , you know everybody?
harold , diane ... ... danny , stacey .
so keep up the good work .
thank you for your contributions .
see ya .
do you wanna tell me about her?
what's her name?
stacey .
she could barely look at me , and she was blushing .
i guess it's because she's madly in love with me .
all those bursting adolescent hormones .
you don't really think?
no , of course not .
good .
i should hope not .
so what's the matter?
trevor ... ... you promised not to do the urban legends lecture this semester .
you knew we were getting data from the freshmen , so why did you ruin it?
i love you , but i can't hold up their education ... ... while you complete a thesis .
be realistic .
i have a curriculum to follow .
yes , i know .
so don't be mad at me .
if you look in the mirror and say his name five times ... ... he'll appear behind you , breathing down your neck .
can i clean your room?
sure , don't mind me .
so billy began .
he looked in the mirror , and he said , " candyman , candyman , candyman
candyman , huh?
you've heard of him?
you doing a study on him?
yes , i am .
what have you heard?
everybody scared of him once it gets dark .
he lives over at cabrini .
my friend told me .
cabrini green?
yeah , in the projects .
i don't know too much about it .
but my friend knows about it .
her cousin lives at cabrini .
they say he killed a lady .
can i talk to your friend?
sure .
kitty?
what do you want?
lady down here wanna talk to you .
she's coming .
i'm helen lyle .
nice to meet you .
henrietta mosely .
and this is kitty culver .
tell her about the candyman .
all i know is ... ... there was a lady in a tub , and she heard a noise .
do you remember her name?
i think her name was ruthie jean .
she heard smashing , like someone was making a hole in the wall .
so ruthie called 91 1 and said , " somebody's coming through the walls .
they didn't believe her .
they thought the lady was crazy , right?
she called 91 1 again , and they still didn't believe her .
when they finally got there , she was dead .
was she shot?
no .
she was killed with a hook .
it's true .
yeah , it is .
i read it in the papers .
candyman killed her .
yeah , but i don't know nothing about that .
helen , this is sick .
this isn't a fairy tale .
a woman got killed .
that's not the half of it .
that's cabrini green , unrecognizable today .
i won't even drive past there .
heard a kid got shot there .
every day .
okay , now look carefully at this picture ... ... and then this one .
do you spot it?
no .
it's not cabrini green .
that's this building , lincoln village .
my apartment was built as a housing project .
now take a look at this .
once built , the city saw there was no barrier from here to the gold coast .
unlike where the highway and the ei train keep the ghetto cut off .
so they made minor alterations .
they covered the cinder block in plaster and sold the lot as condos .
how much did you pay for this?
don't ask .
wait till you see this .
here's proof .
the killer , or killers , they don't know which ... ... smashed through the back of this cabinet .
see , there's no wall there .
it's only a medicine chest between us and the other apartment .
what are you doing?
someone could be on the toilet .
no , the apartment's vacant .
okay , now take a look .
that is amazing !
someone's in there !
i saw a light go on !
there's nobody there .
faking !
that's not funny .
you didn't scare me at all .
yeah , right .
you don't believe that nonsense , do you?
i don't .
do you?
all right ....
candyman , candyman , candyman , candyman ...
... candyman .
you chicken !
you have to do it five times !
come on .
trevor?
oh , trevor !
who were you expecting?
what time is it?
it's late and i'm smashed .
sorry i scared you .
what's with the arsenal?
it's only eight blocks .
you got us dressed up like cops .
i just said dress conservatively .
well , we look like cops .
why try to scare me?
i'm not !
i want you to think .
the gangs hold this area hostage .
let's just turn around !
let's just go back ... ... and write a boring regurgitation of the usual crap on urban legend .
we've got a real shot here , bernadette .
an entire community starts attributing daily horrors to a mythical figure .
would trevor and archie chicken out?
in a second .
exactly .
all right .
wanna wait here?
no .
then let's go .
and lock the car .
where you going?
just going inside .
excuse me , you can't come up here .
just going to see a friend .
sure you're not the police?
look like 5 0 to me !
ask blondie where she's going .
who's she going to see?
let's take the stairs .
come on .
where you all going there?
heads up , people !
5 0 coming up the back door !
police !
they think we're cops .
they're not gonna follow us .
hang on .
look at this .
this is great .
sweets to ... ... the sweet !
hurry up , helen .
let me just get the door .
jesus !
sorry .
jesus , helen !
here it is .
don't go in there !
come on , come on .
jesus , it stinks .
see , i was right .
the layout is identical .
which means the bathroom is over there .
helen !
what's the problem?
a woman died in there .

there's nothing to see .
wait a minute .
this is where he crawled through , right?
we found it .
let's go .
wait a second .
okay , hang on to this .
what?
i'm just gonna go through .
when i get back , we'll go .
you're kidding .
it's a derelict apartment .
what if someone's packing drugs?
you just apologize and give your card?
all right , let's listen .
there's nobody there .
hurry up !
be careful .
give me the camera .

helen lyle .

we want to just talk to you for a few minutes .

how are our two beautiful graduate students doing?
trevor says you're dabbling in my favourite subject .
i can't wait to review your data .
i can fit you in tomorrow .
we're not ready yet .
that's precisely the moment which i can be of greatest assistance .
before you disappear down a path to academic bolivia .
i think i've been there .
actually , purcell , we're about to bury you .
what?
we'll have something in a week or so .
but we only went to cabrini today
cabrini green?
candyman country .
if you're after the hook man , read the paper i wrote about him ... ... 1 0 years ago .
you know the story , don't you?
then how are you going to bury me?
the legend first appeared in 1 890 .
candyman was the son of a slave .
his father had amassed a fortune from designing a device ... ... for the mass producing of shoes after the civil war .
candyman had been sent to the best schools ... ... and had grown up in polite society .
he had a prodigious talent as an artist ... ... and was much sought after when it came to the ... ... documenting of one's wealth and position in society in a portrait .
it was in this latter capacity ... ... he was hired by a rich landowner to capture his daughter's virginal beauty .
of course , they fell deeply in love , and she became pregnant .
poor candyman .
her father executed a terrible revenge .
he paid a pack of brutal hooligans to do the deed .
they chased candyman through the town to cabrini green ... ... where they proceeded to saw off his right hand with a rusty blade .
and no one came to his aid .
but this was just the beginning of his ordeal .
nearby there was an apiary .
dozens of hives filled with hungry bees .
they smashed the hives and stole the honeycomb ... ... and smeared it over his prone , naked body .
candyman was stung to death by the bees .
they burned his body on a giant pyre ... ... then scattered his ashes over cabrini green .
hello .
anne marie ain't in .
are you sure?
yeah , she said you'd be back .
what's your name?
jake .
listen , jake , maybe you can help me out .
i wanted to find out about that woman who got killed .
do you know anything about that?
her name was ruthie jean .
i don't know nothing .
did anybody else talk about it?
you know , it's okay to talk to me ... ... jake ... ... because i'm not a cop .
so nobody will get in trouble .
i can't say nothing , or candyman will get me .
candyman , huh?
you scared of him?
i ain't scared of nobody .
but you're crazy , walking here on your own .
it ain't safe around here .
yeah , i know .
but i don't scare too easy either , jake .
you know , you don't have to tell me .
you could just show me .
and if you show me where candyman is , i'll make you a promise .
it'll be our secret .
unless you're too scared .
somebody building a bonfire?
yeah , for the party .
in there .
candyman's in there?
my friend charlie say so .
a boy got killed there .
who was he?
ain't sure .
charlie told me he was weird .
he was crazy?
no , a retard .
his mom was in the store .
the boy had to go to the bathroom .
his mom is taking her time , choosing this , looking at that ... ... so the boy start moaning .
his mom get mad at him , send him across the street .
his mom is at the checkout .
she hears him screaming .
mommy !
there's a big tough guy .
he runs over to check it out .
come out of there shaking and crying .
he only been in there five seconds .
come out of there , and his hair turned white .
i mean , it turned white , just like that !
was the boy murdered?
worse .
he's lying on the floor in a pool of blood , holding himself .
they found it floating in the toilet .
can't fix that .
better off dead .
did candyman do this?
you wait here for me , okay?
okay .
hello?
candyman !
oh , excuse me .
i'm done here .
i'll get out of your way .
listen , i don't wanna interfere .
i'm not a cop .
i'm from the university of illinois .
i'll just get out of your way .
come on !
let me go !
you're not being very smart !
my colleagues know i'm here and expect me back .
now let me go !
i hear you're looking for candyman , bitch .
well , you found him !
we hear you're looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
number four , step forward and say the line .
we hear you're looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
number five , step forward and say the line .
we hear you're looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
take them out .
number five .
good work .
how'd you catch him?
we swept the place .
we work down from the top floor .
that way , you can flush them all out .
whole of cabrini is locked down now .
you're lucky to be alive , ms. lyle .
did he kill ruthie jean?
oh , no question .
killed that kid as well .
he ran the overlords .
we knew everything about him .
we couldn't bring him in before , because no one would testify .
we can't protect them down at cabrini green , and they knew that .
what about the little boy?
jake?
we don't need him .
we have you .
hey , jake !
i wanted to thank you for saving my life .
i wanna go home !
we'll get you out of here .
you did good .
you said it was our secret .
you lied !
it still is , jake .
you don't have to go to court .
candyman will get me !
candyman isn't real .
he's just a story .
you know , like dracula ... ... or frankenstein .
a bad man took his name so he could scare us .
now that he's locked up , things will be okay .
candyman ain't real?
no .
hey , you !
slow down !
you're supposed to be the invalid here .
look .
it's much better today .
yeah , looks great .
come sit down .
did you already eat?
no , of course not .
okay , good .
hey !
welcome back !
thanks !
let me see .
i'm so glad you're okay !
i would have totally freaked .
yeah , but you know what bugs me?
two people get murdered .
the cops do nothing .
a white woman gets attacked , and they lock the place down .
but this was a bad guy .
you put him away .
that's all that matters .
oh !
i've got a surprise for you .
what?
you're not gonna believe it .
the pictures !
a photographer friend ... ... managed to save most of them .
the camera was smashed .
that's not all !
some publishers are very interested ... ... since you made the local section .
we're gonna be published .
i'll come over tomorrow .
we'll get started !
yeah .
okay .
helen .
yes?
helen .
who is that?
who is that?
helen ... ... l came for you .
do i know you?
no ... ... but you doubted me .
i'm sorry , i have to go .
no need to leave yet .
but i'm late .
you are not content with the stories ... ... so i was obliged to come .
be my victim .
be my victim .
i am the writing on the wall ... ... the whisper in the classroom .
without these things , i am nothing .
so now i must shed innocent blood .
come with me .
anthony !

i was attacked  respond to the question !

at approximately 1 0 p . m . , anne marie mccoy ... ... returned to her apartment .
she discovered her dog with its head cut off .
she cried for assistance .
you attacked her with a meat cleaver .
you still possessed this weapon ... ... when the arresting officers came to her aid .
where's the baby?
i don't know .
you're sick .
before i ask further questions , would you like to have counsel?

people , back off !
we have no comment .
absolutely nothing to say !
we have absolutely nothing to say !
my client has not been charged .
some information indicates baby anthony was abducted and may still be alive .
the blood may be the dog's .
a suspect was released today , after questioning .
we'll just have to follow this one as
they didn't mention your name .
that's good .
there's no charges yet .
they think they'll find a body .
i'm afraid they're shooting for murder one .
but i don't think they have a chance .
do you think i did it?
nobody believes that .
but it's crossed your mind?
is there anything ... ... any detail , however small , that you can recall ... ... that would help us substantiate your version of events?
i blacked out .
i mean , i don't know what happened .
i just woke up there , and there was blood everywhere .
can i get you anything?
you sure?
i'm supposed to go over to the campus and pick up some work .
i'm concerned about leaving you alone .
i'll be about 20 minutes .
trevor?
where were you last night?
i was here .
i was fast asleep .
i thought you were with bernadette .
look , honey ... ... l'm gonna stand by you .
we're gonna get through this , okay?
i'll be right back .
believe in me .
be my victim .
do you believe in me?
keep away from me !
i have the child .
allow me to take you , or he will die in your place .
your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation .
without them , i am nothing .
so i was obliged to come .
and now i must kill you .
your death will be a tale to frighten children ... ... to make lovers cling closer in their rapture .
come with me and be immortal .
helen !

why do you want to live?
if you would learn just a little ... ... from me , you would not beg to live .
i am rumour .
it is a blessed condition , believe me .
to be whispered about at street corners .
to live in the other people's dreams ... ... but not to have to be .
do you understand?
please , god ... ... don't let him kill the baby .
trevor? !
where are you going?
no , you can't leave me here !
i can't defend myself !

i've been committed?

we've been stabilizing you on thorazine .

i'm working for your defence .

what's the matter?
scared of something?
i hate the colour scheme .
what were you gonna do , trevor?

you knew i was never coming out , didn't you?
we should call the hospital .
okay .

is that what you wanna do?
call them !
i'm not a murderer .
i'm not .
trevor , you are all i had left .
it's over .
they will all abandon you .
all you have left is my desire for you .
helen !
you came to me .
the child .
we had a deal .
surrender to me now ... ... and he shall be unharmed .
we have a bargain .
but i'm afraid .
do you fear the pain ... ... or what is beyond?
both .
the pain , i can assure you ... ... will be exquisite .
as for our deaths , there is nothing to fear .
our names will be written on a thousand walls .
our crimes told ... ... and retold by our faithful believers .
we shall die together in front of their very eyes ... ... and give them something to be haunted by .
come with me ... ... and be immortal .
you're mine now .
it's time for a new miracle .
it was always you , helen .
it was always you .
he's here .
i'm coming .
it's okay .
check it out , man !

they got the candyman out there !
i saw him go in there !
i saw him !
the candyman's in there !
i saw him !
i knew you'd come .
burn him !
help !
help !
you lied to me !
we must be on our way now , you and l .
our bones will soon be ashes ... ... and we shall never be separated again .
let me go .
i cannot !
we are already dead .
come back to me !
come back !
we commend to almighty god our sister , helen .
we commit her body to the ground .
earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust .
the lord bless her and keep her and give her peace .
god of holiness and power , accept our prayers on behalf of helen .
do not count her deeds against her .
for in her heart , she desired to do your will .
may god bless you .
the father ... ... and the son and the holy spirit .
my god , look at that !
trevor?
what is it?
are you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
aren't you hungry?
