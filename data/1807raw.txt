if you just would have committed , you could have made that wave .
whatever .
at least she went .
that wave was huge .
i would have never gone .
she was perfectly positioned .
if she had the balls to charge ...
why does the sun rise in the east?
what?
why does the sun rise in the east?
because it sets in the west .
because that's the way the earth rotates .
do you remember that superman episode ... where he was , like , spinning around the earth backwards ... trying to rotate it in the other direction?
yeah .
yeah , yeah .
to bring back time?
i thought you finished .
i did .
i'm just checking it .

looks like he learned how to shake right .
hi , mr. pakui .
anne marie , this is the eighth time ... your sister's been tardy in the last month .
i know .
traffic ...
if you think surfing is more important than school , we got to make other arrangements .
you know what , mr. pakui , the only other arrangement i can think of is my mother .
and she just so happens to be with her latest meal ticket in vegas ... who apparently isn't so cool with the kid's menu , you know what i mean?
so right now , this is the best arrangement i can do .
you know , penny's a smart girl .
yeah , she is .
just like her sister was .

present tense .
i learned that much while i was here .
you better watch it , girl .
i'm doing the best i can do .

it's pretty nice .
i'm gonna ...
i'm just gonna go ...

yeah , i know where it is .
thanks .
what are you doing?
uh , i'm just trying to find the money that i hid .

yeah , right .
uh , let's see .
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine ...
whoa , wait .
that's ...
that's way , way just ...
that's ...
that's a $1, 000 .
i'll be here a week .
that's $150 a day .
so i gave myself a $50 discount for paying up front .
are you trying to buy me?
no .
no .
i just don't want to lose you .
can i ask you a really weird question?
yeah .
are you wearing my cologne?
yes .

hey , you .
yeah?
hey .
hey , sweetheart .

yeah , i know .
i tried to call earlier , but , uh , no one was there .
yeah , i miss you too .
i miss you too .
it's been hectic .
matt , i'm gonna ...
listen , let me call you back , all right?
all right .
i love you too .
all right , bye bye .
sorry .
guess that's why they have that no fraternization rule .
what do you mean?
management gets call from irate wife ... wondering why maid is in husband's room at 2 : 00 in the morning .
that's not my wife .
wife , girlfriend , boyfriend .
no , really .
it's not my wife .
look , it's my niece .
actually , my ... my sister's daughter , rebecca .
there she is .
so .
i swear .
she's beautiful .
yeah , she is .
she's a sweetheart .
sorry about that .
it's just , uh , kinda strange with the time difference .
i should probably go .
it's getting late .
all right .
do we have a surf lesson tomorrow?
definitely .
all right .
okay .
bye .
bye .
bye .
i thought you were just giving him lessons .
i did .
huh .
yeah , in what?
penny didn't finish her homework .
you weren't here to help me .
she's got to do her homework .
don't give us shit 'cause you were out there working it .
shut up .
don't deny it .
you were working it like a rib without sauce .
shut up ...
ow !
well , what happened?
oh , my god .
nothing .
oh , sure .
tell me what happened .
no .
did you get some play?
huh?
did you?
did you?
we kissed for two seconds .
it wasn't a big deal .
i'm sure you did .
how much am i supposed to buy that for?
what do you take me for?
i don't know .
seriously .
what else?
come on .
here , this will pay the bills .
there's , like , $1, 000 here .
i feel like your pimp .
you must know how to kiss .
or you must know how to do something else .
good night , penny .
you're going to bed now .
hey .
what's up?
look , i hate to be the buzzkill here , but the contest is in a week .
and i just don't think that it's time for ...
i know .
but i did promise him another lesson tomorrow .
can't you just blow him off?
no .
why not?
because he already paid me .
exactly .
eden .
i wanted to rent a jet ski tomorrow .
put you into some size .
get you ready for pipe .
i'll meet you at the launch at 4 : 00 .
why not earlier?
i'll meet you there as soon as i can .
where we going again?
a little spot the hotel does not tell the tourists about .
oh , my god .
you drive like you surf .
i drive like i wished i surfed .
wow .
this is beautiful .
yeah .
i used to come here when i was a kid .
i've been dreaming about surfing all night .
aw , minnesota's got surf stoke .
watch out .
yeah .
whoo hoo !
how many sisters you got , minnesota?
uh , five .
five?
five .
really?
you're the only boy?
uh , yep .
explains what?
well , that explains it then .
that's why you're not intimidated by women .
yeah .
why is that funny?
because i'm scared shitless of women .
my sisters would beat me on a regular basis .
see , look .
see how i can't extend my finger?
yes .
because my sister dana broke it when i was eight ... just because i wouldn't get out of her room .
because it's broken that way , when i throw the football , it gives it a nice little zip .
a nice little touch?
exactly .
uh , i think we got company .
oh , great .
yeah , i do .
we gotta go .
you know those guys?
really?
yeah .
prepare to get vibed .
this place is kapu .

drew , back off .
we grew here , you flew here .
it's not his fault .
what are you doing on our beach , haole boy?
you don't live here , you don't surf here .

oh , yeah .

i can see why the tourists here never leave their hotels .
oh , don't say that .
that's not real hawaii .
they're just ...
they're just crazy .
they're so protective of their land and their waves , especially .
and their women?

i'm glad i'm here .

helping .
why?
you're not a maid anymore .
don't be mad at me .
i'm not mad .
mmm . !

you didn't save me any whipped cream though .
some guy thinks you look hot in a bikini , and you forget all about the contest .
that's not fair , and you know it .
champagne?
how cheesy are you?
shut up .
i'm not mad .
it's just ...
i happen to know that you kick ass out there , and you worked very hard to get to where you are .
i know .
pipe is in three days .
every single sponsor is here , and it's just you and one other girl out there .
i know .
i got it .
okay?
people would kill to be in your shoes .
i got it !
hey , listen to me .

you did not almost die .
you were under for , like , five seconds .
stop being such a barbie .
what did you say to me?

all i'm saying is that if you can't handle this , there's no way you're gonna be ready for the pipe masters .
then you go .
if you're so friggin 'ballsy , eden , you go .
i can't .
i wasn't invited .
i don't know what the hell you want from me .
what i want from you is to get your own life and stop living through me .
get your own dreams .
so that's it .
you're gonna run off and be a pro ho , huh?
at least i have someone that's interested in me .
why does this seem so familiar , huh?
run away when things get tough .
i'm stressed out .
i think i'm gonna ditch my kid ...
shut up ! and run away with some guy i met in california .
shut up !
i'm not kidding !
sounds a little bit too familiar .

like mother , like daughter .
shut up !

you're gonna prove these guys right?
assholes who think that you can't surf pipe because you don't have the balls .

eden . !
you're not a quitter .
you'rejust scared .

all talented and shit .
the boys were spinnin '.

they had to throw up some bullshit rule barring you from the boys 'contest .
i'm gonna be late .

windex , i guess .
or comet .
the only person who knows anything about windex or comet in our house ... is carmen , but not me .
i hope she doesn't think he's gonna marry her .
of course she does .
prince charming come to save her from the toilets .
and get some of that ten million a year .
oh , god .
matt and the maid .

what the ...
oh , man .
uh , anne marie , uh ...
anne marie .
anne marie .
what the hell are you doin '?
i don't know , matt .
what am i doing?
the other day , when i was ordering room service , the guy on the phone called me mrs.
tollman , and i didn't correct him .
'cause for a minute ,
i liked the way it sounded .
and i was just wondering if the denny's waitress felt the same way .
listen ...
you know what?
i'm fine , okay .
i know what i am , and i'm fine with it .
what?
who are you?
i'm the maid that you slept with on vacation .
i'm the great story you tell when someone asks you how you learned to surf .
you don't trust anybody , do you?
can i?
can i trust you?
to do what?
i mean ...
what do you want?
what do i want?
oh , my god .
i want ...
penny to quit smoking and to go to college .
i want ...
i want to be able to pay the phone and the electricity ... and the rent all in the same month .
i want a girl to be on the cover of surf magazine , and that would be great if that girl were me , but any girl would do .
and i want ...
i mean , i wish my mom would come home .
and i really , really want to win pipe masters tomorrow .
that's what i want .
well , do it .
matt , you don't understand , okay?
pipe ...
pipe is the heaviest wave in the world .
okay , you don't just get worked there .
you die .
people die there .
and what happens when i just ... when i paddle out and i don't take off on a single wave?
i don't care if i make a fool out of myself , but i do not want to embarrass my family .
and that's what lena and eden and penny are .
they're my family .
just tell me what to do , please .
you want me to tell you what to do?
yes .
you know what to do .
no , matt , i honestly don't .
just be the girl i met on the beach .
who?
who was she?
a girl who'd never ask a guy what to do .
good morning , everybody .
welcome to the pipe masters ... here at banzai pipeline on the north shore of oahu .
you're gonna be watching women's surfng history today ... as these girls take on the deadliest waves in the world .
imagine the niagara falls dumping into two feet of water over hard rock lava ... with razor sharp reef and underwater caves .
it's gonna be a macking 20 feet .
good luck to all the ladies competing today at the pipe masters .
they may be the best in the world , but they're gonna have their hands full today .
if you're going down to watch , it's not a day for a dip in the water .
anne marie , you all right?
mm hmm .
you guys get out here .
i'll go find some parking .
pretty much an impossible score at this point .
she's way behind , but she's still gonna try and put it on the line .
looks like she's goin'for this one .
oh . !
she broke her board .
any day at pipeline , it's critical , but today , one false move and the consequences could be disastrous .
more surfers have died here than any other spot on the planet combined .
this is the first time the girls have gotten to compete at pipeline .
the entire surfcommunity is here today ... every sponsor , talent scout , the entire surf media ... looking to find the next surfsensation .
get one good ride here today , and you'll put yourself on the surfng map .
out there all by herself is lynette mackenzie , now that megan's on the beach with a broken board .
she's in on a nice one .
she's comin'in .
you really have to commit if you are gonna get those waves .
but i'm sure it'll better the score she already has .
good luck , layne .
thanks .
i could use it .
i'm here for the competition .
are you a volunteer?
she's a competitor .
you need to sign this release form .
in case of death or dismemberment "?
thank you .
you'll be in heat four with kate skarratt .
you can go ahead and wait in the competitors 'area .
thank you .
good luck .
it's looking pretty solid out there , isn't it?
oh , my gosh .
there's kate skarratt .
she kills at pipe .
and there's rochelle ballard .
she's queen ofback door .
oh , my gosh . !
layne beachley is ...
i know who they are .
what?
i'm ...
you're good .
i'm just saying ... they're ... they're really good .
shit . !
come on .
let's go .
hey !
what's up , man?
what's up?
where's parking around here?
anywhere , i guess whatever you can find .
looks like she's goin'on this one .
hey .
hey , anne marie .
look what i found .
next heat , keala kennelly .
hey .
just driving by .
what's up , surfer girl?
do the damn thing .
shit .
twenty foot swell on the rise .
pretty weird out there .
it's a super clean , west northwest swell .
pipe and back door are both open .
yeah .
just be patient .
don't get too anxious .
it's four wave sets with 20 second intervals .
take your time .
don't take the first wave of the set .
third wave looks the best .
here comes kennelly taking off .
steep drop .
she makes the bottom turn .
she's fierce , man .
gets covered up .
oh . !
she makes it out .
let's give her a warm round of applause .
i'm way out of my league .
hey .
no worries .
just go out there and have fun .
fun .
up next , from australia , we have kate skarratt in red .
she's a goofy foot , which favors her at pipeline .
loves charging big waves and has taken first place at teahupoo , another barreling left hander in tahiti .
surfng against her , we have wild card entry , anne marie chadwick , a formerjunior nssa champion who dropped out of the competitive circuit ... after a near drowning incident at this very spot just three years ago .
five , four , three , two , one .
we've got 20 minute heats today with the top four waves scoring .
wave selection is critical .
if you pick the wrong wave , wipe out , get caught inside ...
you could spend the rest of your heatjust trying to get back to the lineup .
how's it goin '?
good .
nice set approaching .
got good sets out the back .
we have really good consistency with swell .
it's on the rise .
probably gonna get up to about 15 to 20 feet .
kate skarratt's goin 'on this one .
she's paddling , gets to her feet .
makes the drop .
solid bottom turn .
look at that pit . !
she's setting her line , racing to make it out .
trying to get to the shoulder .
traveling ...
oh . !
she didn't quite get around that last turn .
she'll get some kind of score for it .
looks like it's a 4 .
1 that came in on the board .
water patrol's checking on her .
looks like she's okay .
if she doesn't need a ride , she can paddle back out .
so chadwick all alone by herself out there , yet to even score a ride .
go , go !
paddle !
headed for her first ride .
backs out .
shit !
beautiful wave .
she's not gonna get any more like that .
what a waste of wave .
she should've gone .
that would have opened up perfectly .
shit !
when you're out there all alone , you can psyche yourself out .
you can do it , girl .
chadwick will have to wait for the next set .
what are you doin '?
kate skarratt's paddling into one of the best waves of the day .
0h . !
look at this wave .
it is a bomb .
oh . !
she's a little overextended and goes down .
hope she's okay out there .
kate skarratt down .
ooh .
great pickup .
gets her on the sled , out ofharm's way .
hang on .
okay , everybody , as the ski comes up on the beach , please give them some room .
the water patrol needs some space to work .
skate skarratt has gone down on that last wave .
they're carrying the backboard down .
this isn't good .
we need dr. leland dao to report to the medical tent .
leland dao , please report to the medical tent .
we need you down here immediately .
come on .
come on .
charge it !
go , go , go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
she sets her rail .
makes the drop .
textbook .
oh . !
it's setting up perfectly .
look at that .
beautiful wave .
she should get a nice score for this one , yes ! high enough to take her into the next round .
oh . !
oh , she got so worked .
i don't see her .
where is she?
man , is she all right?
where is she?
oh !
anne marie's taking a heavy beating out there .
grab my hand .
i got you .
hang on .
not that she cares right now , but thejudges 'scores havejust come in ... and they've awarded her a 4 . 6 for the last ride , which will move her into the next round over skarratt .
anne marie !
are you okay?
is she gonna be all right?
is she gonna be all right?
she'll be okay .
just give her some room .
is she gonna be okay?
i think so .
i'm gonna put some ice on it .
lift your head .
just lay there and relax for a minute .
hey .
if you tell me to be the girl on the beach right now , i'm gonna kick your ass .
oh .
so how are you feelin '?
i've been better .
yeah .
my , uh , my first nfl game ,
i got blindsided by warren sapp .
i tell you , i've never been hit so hard in my life .
i lay there praying something was broken so i wouldn't have to get up and finish the game .
you think i'm faking?
no .
i know you got rocked out there .
just like i did .
but leslie sat me down , said that was the hardest i'd ever be hit and that i would regret not going back in .
so i ...
i went back in .
and you won the game .
no .
actually , we lost .
and i got my ass kicked .
but there's this one beautiful pass ... one perfect spiral right into omar's fingertips ... and a touchdown .
look , i can't talk you into goin'back out there .
it's ...
it seems crazy .
but i know how good you are , and i know how much this means to you .
i just don't want you to spend your life wondering what could have been .
heads up on the beach , people .
big set approaching .
hey , everybody , we have a set out the back .
watch your kids .
watch your belongings .
the water is coming over the berm .
it's dangerous out there .
the water patrol already has their hands full , so we'd appreciate it if you'djust back up .
here today we have a rising swell , so i wanna give a little word of warning to everybody to watch out .
guys , look , this is really not a good time .
can i get a picture?
what?
can we get a picture?
we're working these chicks here .
they think you're some kind of great hockey player or something .
you're kidding .
no joke .
we wanna get this thing done .
sorry my pits stink .
that's just the way it goes .
let's go .
right here .
smile .
you're on vacation .
this way , this way .
fluff your bangs a little bit .
a little more attitude .
beautiful .
one more .
all right , great .
hey .
hey .
you goin 'back out there?
yup .
it's just a stupid contest .
it's not worth getting hurt over .
i'll be fine .
hey .
what?
be careful .
yeah .
that sounds the start of the next heat .
chadwick's pretty much got her hands full this next round .
keala kennelly from hawaii .
she's a charger .
she'll go on anything .
she goes like a man out here .
bit of a paddle battle going on out there .
looks like chadwick and kennelly are paddling for the peak .
chadwick's got the inside position .
if a big set approaches , she's gonna get the first wave .
come on , come on .
this paddle battle is really about who's gonna get the first wave .
chadwick in position , heading for the first wave .
starts to paddle .
she's goin'for it .
oh . !
she ...
she pulls back .
kennelly's wide open .
she catches a wave .
time and time again , man .
she's out , making it look so easy .
but , folks , it's not easy out there .
chadwick starts to paddle .
she paddles for it .
doesn't quite get it .
what a waste of wave .
that's gotta hurt when you know you need a score , and you're going up against one of the best surfers in this event , and you don't go .
plenty of time being allowed here for kennelly to get back in position , and she's paddled right inside of chadwick , and she's looking to catch her next wave .
keala kennelly .
hands together , ladies and gentlemen .
keala kennelly .
a great two ride out here at the pipeline .
keala's got sack .
she goes like the men out here .
for some reason , chadwick has yet to even ride a wave .
i don't know what's going on .
i don't know if she's just psyching herself out or if keala's putting it to her .
what are you doin '?
what?
you gonna take a wave or just sit there like a buoy?
look , you're never gonna catch a wave sitting all the way over here .
follow me .
i'll get you into one .
give the crowd something to cheer about .
let's get you a wave .
come on .
follow me into the lineup , and i'm gonna tell you to go on a wave .
and when i tell you to go , you gotta go .
paddle your little heart out .
you can't hesitate .
you can't pull back .
you can't hold back .
no fear , all right?
'cause if you hold back for a second , you're gonna eat shit .
come on .
follow me .
it looks like the next set's approaching .
this is the one .
go .
paddle !
paddle !
go , girl !
paddle !
paddle !
paddle . !
ah !
go . !
oh !
you all right?
i'm okay , i'm okay .
get back out there then .
with only two minutes left in her heat ,
chadwick struggles to get back into the lineup ... so she can catch a scoring wave .
chadwick has yet to even score a good ride , a scoring ride .
she needs to redeem herself .
keala is absolutely dominating this heat , and chadwick needs to put a scoring ride on the board .
ouch .
are you all right?
that was nasty .
it's okay .
i want another one .
you want another one?
that's the spirit .
yup .
shake off that last wave , and let's do this .
less than 20 seconds left .
feel that adrenaline .
use it .
come on .
anne marie chadwick only has one more chance .
on the outside .
here comes one of the best sets of the whole day .
we have lines stacked to the horizon .
here comes a set .
this is the one .
