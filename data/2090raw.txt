they're coming to get you , barbara .
stop it .
they don't like being awakened this way .
why do you have to be so mean?
i'm your older brother .
being mean is part of my job .
they're coming to get you , little sister .
you never know when to stop .
what's the matter?
getting scared?
you're still scared of her , aren't you?
that's why we're here .
no , that's not why we're here .
why do we have to put ourselves through this charade?
because she is our mother .
can't you give her one day of your life?
one day?
this is the fourth time in the three months since she died .
i'm spending more time with her now .
and you know why?
she couldn't be buried in the city .
she knew i had to drive you here .
we're 200 miles from a glass of beer .
johnnie , we're here .
please stop it .
stop what?
the truth?
she damn near drove you into a convent .
when have you had a date?
that is none of your business !
the one thing she never ever drove , was 200 miles to visit anything .
i need you to stop talking like that .
don't talk like that .
not here .
not in the middle of ...
of what?
show some respect .
you really are afraid of this place .
god , you never stop .
for the love of god , johnnie .
bastard !
jesus , you're weird .
let's just get through this .
just get it over with .
they're coming to get you , barbara .
for the love of god , johnnie .
they're horny , barbara .
they've been dead a long time .
look !
there's one of them now .
he wants you .
he's getting closer .
dangerously closer !
stop it , johnnie .
he's going to hear you .
it doesn't matter .
he knows we're here .
it's too late now .
there's no escape .
nooo , mother !!
you bastard .
johnnie i'm sorry .
very sorry .
i'm sorry .
hey , man , are you okay?
is there something we can do to help?
weird , huh?
johnnie !!
help !
please , my brother !
hey , mister !
please , we need help !
please , help us .
is there anybody here?
hello?
hello?
anyone else inside?
you got any shotguns in there?
hunting rifles , anything .
i don't know .
you don't know?
hey , come on !
come on , let's go .
no !
come on !
die ... damn it !
who is he?
do you know him?
it's all right .
you did what you had to do .
do you know any of them?
the ones outside?
this isn't your house?
you don't live here?
look , talk to me girl .
do you have a car?
do you have a car?
the windows .
they can't break through the door , but they can get through the glass .
god damn you !!
god damn all of you !
truck's on empty .
we can't take the chance of running dry in the middle of nowhere .
we'll hole up here .
hope that some help comes .
my name is ben .
what's your name?
barbara .
look here , barbara .
i don't need you falling apart on me .
i know you can fight when you have to .
you have to now , right now .
fight with your thinking and feeling .
fighting keeps you strong and keeps you thinking straight .
what's happening?
i don't know .
nobody knows .
radio in the truck ...
all i heard was trash talk .
same as always .
people trying to sound like they know , but they don't really know shit !
one guy said it's escaped prisoners on the loose from hennessey .
another guy said it's some kind of chemical that makes everybody go crazy .
they don't know shit .
how do they explain a man walking around with his neck broken?
a man shot full of holes and still coming at you?
assholes ... ... down in evans out for a good time with their guns and their six packs .
assholes trying to round them up and put them in the back of trucks .
like they know what they're going to do with them .
they had ten ... twenty of them in the back of this panel truck .
they opened the door to let another one in .
they came spilling out of there .
like bugs .
i was at a diner .
windows shot out .
lady next to me shot dead .
others , too ...
i saw six or seven go down .
car exploded outside .
my car caught on fire .
it was like ... like a war .
some of those things made it inside the diner .
started coming after us .
some good old boy comes chasing them .
mean son of a bitch had some kind of hot shit gun , like an m 16 .
starts ... shooting around .
bullets tearing up the place .
i saw one of those things take thirty hits and keep on coming .
the damn thing had to be dead , but it kept on coming .
until it took a hit in the head .
that brought it down .
the only way to stop them , you have to ... ... get them in the head .
i don't know what's going on , but i know it's not a prison break .
no chemical i ever heard about can make a dead man walk .
this is something that nobody has ever heard about or seen before .
this is hell on earth .
this is pure hell on earth .
damn .
doesn't take long for the world to fall apart , does it?
there's got to be guns in this house .
maybe upstairs .
i'll go take a look around .
will you be all right down here alone?
there's something up there .
what?
what is it?
it's all right .
nothing to worry about .
what is it?
it's nothing .
it's all right .
ben !
it's all right , don't shoot !
it's just us !
who the hell is " us "?
tom bitner .
this is harry cooper .
his wife is calling from the cellar .
they have a sick little girl down there .
my woman's down there , too .
mind if we ask who the hell you are?
she's barbara .
i'm ben .
you damn near broke my arm .
harry , for god's sake !
aren't you going to answer?
it's all right .
some people up here .
didn't you hear all the noise?
we could have used some help .
maybe you can see through walls .
we heard some banging around up here .
it could have been those things .
no , that isn't right .
we heard the girl calling out .
we were just scared .
you want to know the truth?
we were scared to hell .
you live here , tom?
no ... it's my uncle rege's house .
he and my cousin satchel .
my uncle is dead , i swear .
i touched him , he was stone cold dead !
that's the truth .
we can talk in the cellar .
we walked on over to be with satchel .
radio said there was some trouble .
we didn't see anything .
we've heard all this before !
i didn't hear it before , cooper .
go on , tom .
me and judy rose walked over , as i said .
after ten minutes , mr. cooper came banging on the door .
how did you get here?
you trying to figure out if somebody's got a car?
mine is broken down on the interstate , and the kid doesn't own one .
what about you , mr. ben?
you don't exactly look like neighbours .
truck .
outside .
out of gas .
gas?
evans city is five miles away .
we can make it on friggin 'fumes .
what if we can't?
are you willing to take that chance?
besides , evans city is a war zone .
i've been there .
it'll take a lot more than five miles to get any help .
there's a gas pump out by the shed .
my uncle keeps it locked .
you know where the key is?
no , but i can hunt for it .
we will , but not now .
it could take too long .
we have to figure out what we're doing .
finish your story , tom .
this is bullshit ! lf we're going to do something , let's do it .
let's stand around and bullshit in the cellar where it's safe .
i'm not so sure that's a smart move .
what do you mean?
i'm not sure locking ourselves in that cellar is a smart move .
i want to know what all the options are .
what damn options?
and who the fuck gave you the right to decide for us?
i'm not deciding for you .
i'm thinking about my own ass .
you want to go down there , go !
harry , what's going on?
helen , quit yelling at me !
i can't think straight !
you know , cooper .
i've only been around you for a minute , but i don't like you very much .
i'm sure you feel the same about me , so let's stay out of each other's way .
go on , tom .
what else do you have to tell?
well ...
like i said , we were here for ten minutes , then mr. cooper banged on the door .
we let in mr. cooper and his wife .
i saw the little girl was hurt .
i tried to call for help , but the phone was making this sound .
i tried , but i couldn't call anybody .
that's when uncle rege ...
he came walking out of the bedroom .
he was dead a minute before .
he wasn't dead .
he couldn't have been .
you made a mistake , that's all .
he was dead .
i know he was .
what happened?
uncle rege went after my cousin .
he went after him like ...
i don't know .
anybody else in the house?
no , just them .
tom ...
your cousin is dead .
i know he's dead .
he shot himself .
when uncle rege came after him , i ran down to get the shotgun .
i couldn't imagine shooting uncle rege .
i couldn't imagine doing a thing like that .
that's when i told everyone to go down in the cellar .
it was my idea .
it was a good idea .
look outside .
into the cellar .
no , it's a death trap .
they may be able to break through the door .
we'll be cornered down there .
there's still some way to escape .
a way out is a way in .
the windows !
we can board them up .
there's no time ...
there's only three of them .
i've handled more by myself .
the cellar door won't hold them .
but the windows will?
i don't need this .
if you want to go downstairs , go on !
you can be boss down there , i'm boss up here .
what are you going to do?
come up , we need your help .
you're crazy !
you're out of your minds !
this is judy rose .
get the shelves from the kitchen .
we'll board up the windows .
tommy , are you sure we'll be all right?
there are things out there like uncle rege .
come on , do what i tell you !
i'll shut this door until somebody comes who can get us out of here .
if somebody comes , we'll try to remember to call you .
you lamebrains !
you're going to die up here .
what's happening?
they decided to stay upstairs .
what about us?
it's safer down here .
what about sarah?
it's safer down here , helen !
there's just this one hammer .
here , use this .
nail them up quick and dirty .
get the windows covered .
we'll reinforce them later .
if you find any keys , hang on to them .
how many people are up there?
two more .
and they have the gun?
no , they have two .
they might have a hundred guns , but it's safer down here !
we have to get help for sarah .
i'm not opening that door and neither are you , and if you try ...
what?
it is your daughter lying there .
we have to get her to a doctor .
there's no doctors upstairs , and there's no way out of here .
none of those yo yos has a car !
what a place to be stuck .
in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of yo yos .
the fever's got worse .
look , she's going to be all right .
somebody will come , we'll get out of here .
we're all going to be all right .
they're crazy .
they're out of their minds .
you bunch of yo yos !!
this is the last of the big stuff .
not going to do it .
hey , tom , give me a hand .
turn it over .
come on !
get the legs .
all right , i'll be back here .
come on , come on !
great .
bring my gun when you come back !
nail it .
just get it up .
we'll reinforce it later .
they're so slow .
we could just walk right past them .
we wouldn't even have to run .
we have the guns .
if we're careful , we could get away .
you told me to fight .
i'm fighting , i'm not panicking .
this place is not safe .
we should leave before it's too late .
i know you want to get out of here , and so do l .
we're going to do it .
we'll find a way to the gas , and we'll be gone .
you're doing fine , all right .
we're all doing just fine .
we'll make it if we're careful .
like you said , we have to be careful .
we can get the doors and nail them up .
nice going , tom !
is she crazy or what?
oh , my god !
oh , my god , tommy !
wait a minute .
nail it up !
get a few nails in there .
get some in the table top .
it's all right !
keep nailing , keep pounding !
come on , tom !
over here !
let's get this baby off .
easy .
hit it !
we're going upstairs for a minute .
we'll leave the weapons here .
tom , wait a minute .
wait a minute .
don't go up .
it's all right .
come on .
don't look at it .
is this all new stuff in here?
uncle rege is fixing up the place .
no good .
it's better than nothing , ben .
no good .
hey , tom .
television .
take it out and see if anything's on .
found something .
telling you what to do , i think .
damn .
this must really be big .
station's in zelionople .
it's only twenty miles from here .
might as well be a hundred .
it's going to come on live .
we can't wait for it .
give me a hand with some of that lumber .
we can use it to cover up the windows .
i must be stupid .
the old doors are all in the cellar .
heads up down there .
idiots !
what's happening up there?
how do i know?
they said they wanted to board it up .
board it up , please .
and you refused to help them .
that's right .
i refused , and you know why?
because they're wrong , helen .
the cellar is the only safe place .
you just watch .
they'll beg us to let them in .
and what will you do then , harry?
will you open the door then?
mr. cooper?
we need the doors to board up the windows .
fuck him !
mr. cooper , can you hear me?
cooper !
open this door right now !
we need those doors !
i have a shotgun .
open this door or i'll blow it to shit !
what are you doing?
what do you hope to accomplish?
shut up !!
i'm counting to three .
we're going to open !
i'm counting , that's one .
what are you going to do?
that's two !
better open this door , cooper .
look , i won !
you leave that door open !
we may want to get down there .
you want the best of both worlds .
you want to be able to run down here .
if you want to get into that cellar , you get in there now or forget it !
i'm not boxing myself in until there's no other choice .
and i'm not gambling with my daughter's life !
stay up here , but don't count on me .
i'm not counting on you for shit !
if you want to fight , get out !
this is our house .
here's you all playing rooster with it !
i'd like to know where you'd all be if we didn't let you in here .
where would you be if we kicked you out?
we're not going to kick anyone out .
let's try and work together and get some of this shit done !
you ought to keep her covered .
get some blankets from upstairs .
how did she get hurt?
one of those ... people bit her on the arm .
what?
you want this one , too?
we have to get help .
we have to get a doctor for sarah .
we're going to try .
since you're not doing anything , maybe you could look for those keys .
what keys?
keys to the gas pump out back .
there's a car?
a truck !
the gas pump is locked .
the keys could be anywhere !
where are ... keys ...
i'm looking for ... my god .
oh , my god .
i need the hammer in here !
bring the hammer ...
ease up !
ease up !
helen , we have to go downstairs quickly !
cooper , give me the nails over there !
i can't let go !
you have to help me out !
give me the wrench and nails , man !
cooper !
this is definitely not going to work .
get out of the way !
we have to get downstairs .
take your hands off me !
don't shoot , it's mr. mcgruder !
you shot mr. mcgruder !
look at his back .
look at his back , i didn't do that !
it's like uncle rege .
they're dead , but they're coming for us .
that's impossible .
that just can't be .
grab him .
we'll throw him out the window .
is he dead?
is he dead?
you're all seeing this !
is he dead?
stop it !
you're losing it girl .
you think so?
whatever i lost , i lost a long time ago , and i don't plan on losing more .
you can talk to me about losing it , when you stop screaming at each other .
are you all right?
it's going to be all right , okay?
how many bullets does it hold?
fifteen .
there's more in the desk .
we have a few more windows to cover up .
grab some lumber and get started .
... random acts of violence committed by people in a trance .
they have lost the ability to communicate and reason .
the military has been mobilized , but the violence is so widespread
that it is impossible for the rescue services to respond .
people left to defend themselves ...
citizens faced with the collapse of local police have taken the law into their own hands .
most communities are without telephones , many without power , some without water .
the scientific community is focusing on the trancelike state of the assailants .
clearly a behavioural disorder , but what could have caused such a widespread and dramatic disorder? .
we've heard everything from the ozone layer and chemical weapons to ... voodoo mysticism and organisms from space .
biologists in california have released reports stating that the bodies of the recently dead are returning to life , driven byan unknown force that enables the brain to function .
doctors at the cdc in atlanta reject that theory
calling it preposterous beyond belief .
the only reasonable explanation is a germ , a bacteria or a virus , that has a mind altering effect .
how a germ could have been delivered over such a vast area remains a mystery .
it's being called judgment day by ...
where are you taking it?
no , that stays up here .
get off my back !
damn it .
nice going , asshole !
you were taking it downstairs .
you stupid ...
damn you !
you son of a bitch !
that was our only way of finding out what was going on !
i wasn't taking it downstairs .
you can't get reception in a basement !
what the hell is she doing?
is that your uncle rege?
do you think the keys are in his pocket?
we have to get the keys .
damn it , stay back here .
we can get away .
it's too dangerous .
we could make it .
five miles .
we have cooper's kid .
leave them , we'll bring back help .
make a move , we're drawing a crowd here .
you know i'm right .
we could walk right by them .
i've got the keys .
we have to get to the gas .
it's our best chance .
everybody , back inside !
quick !
damn it , get in here !
you stay inside .
keep the rifle .
you can't go out without the guns .
we have tom's gun .
i want that gun in here .
i don't want any locked doors between me and him .
for crying out loud , do you ...
i don't want to hear another word .
the only way i'm going out is with you keeping things straight .
i'm coming with you .
no , stay in here .
one to drive , one to work the gas and one to ride shotgun .
that's three .
tommy , tell him i know how to drive .
her daddy's got trucks , she's been driving since she was little .
all right .
is that shotgun loaded?
yes , i have shells in my pocket .
can't tell how many's on the porch .
that will be the toughest part .
once we get to the yard we ought to be all right .
there's no way .
you're never going to make it .
you keep an eye on us .
when we start driving back , you get that kid up here !
you get in that truck , get it started .
don't stop no matter what .
you just move !
heads up !
come on , damn it !
get in !
helen , damn it ...
ease up !
shut the door !
start , you piece of shit !
come on !
what's happening?
slow down , we lost ben !
stop the car !
we lost ben , go back !
we lost ben !
what?
why didn't you tell me?
i was hollering at you .
go back !
here he comes .
what should i do?
go down there and get him .
these are the wrong keys .
these are the wrong damn keys !
what the hell are you doing?
i want you down in that cellar , helen .
there's nothing we can do up here now .
do what he says .
i'll try and get to town .
if i can find any help , i'll be back .
come .
we mustn't leave them .
we should wait until ben gets back .
i want you in there where it's safe .
into the cellar , now .
your daughter needs you .
sarah?
oh , my baby ...
i want that gun .
you go to hell .
i want that gun .
give it up .
just crawl back into ...
help me !
cooper !
open this door , god damn it !
son of a bitch !
open it up !
open this door !
god damn it !
give me that !
give it to me !
cooper ! son of a bitch !
open the door !
come on !
push !
push !
get his guns !
sarah?
shoot it .
no .
shoot it , cooper .
no .
but it's my ...
no !
stop !
ben , are you crazy?
cooper , no !
madness .
are you coming?
no .
we can still make it .
no , i'm hurt bad .
go on , get out of here .
i'll bring help if i can .
go !
oh , god !
do not attempt to reach family .
do not attempt to reach any of the rescue stations .
they may no longer be in operation .
repeating this advisory from the office of emergency preparedness .
the dead are being reactivated by forces unknown .
you got that right .
the bodies are weak and uncoordinated
but are capable of inflicting damage on people and property .
they are to be considered extremely dangerous , especially in large numbers .
these can be disposed of only by incapacitating the brain .
they got that right , too .
these reactivated bodies will attack warm blooded animals of all species without provocation , and will devour the flesh .
acts of homicide and cannibalism reported through the afternoon are contributable , at least in part , to these reactivated bodies .
don't shoot !
johnnie ...
jesus god damn holy reverent shit !
what in the name of jupiter's balls are you doing out here alone , lady?
tell me , chief , are they slow moving?
yeah , they're all messed up .
shoot the fuck down !
they're us .
we're them , and they're us .
say what?
nothing .
having fun?
give me a break .
drag that out of here .
i'm going in .
watch your back .
there may be more of them .
you came back .
there's another one for the fire .
