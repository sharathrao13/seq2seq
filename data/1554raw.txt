maycomb was a tired , old town , even in 1932 when i first knew it .
somehow it was hotter then .
men's stiff collars wilted by 9 : 00 in the morning .
ladies bathed before noon , after their 3 : 00 naps ... and by nightfall were like soft tea cakes ... with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum .
the day was 24 hours long , but it seemed longer .
there was no hurry , for there was nowhere to go ... and nothing to buy ; no money to buy it with .
although maycomb county had recently been told ... that it had nothing to fear but fear itself .
that summer i was six years old .
good morning , mr. cunningham .
good morning , miss .
my daddy's getting dressed .
would you like me to call him for you?
i don't care to bother .
why , it's no bother , mr. cunningham .
he'll be happy to see you .
atticus !
atticus?
it's mr. cunningham .
good morning , walter .
good morning , mr. finch .
i didn't want to bother you none .
i brung you these here hickory nuts as part of my entailment .
well , i thank you .
the collards we had last week were delicious .
well , 'morning .
'morning .
scout , i think maybe , uh , next time mr. cunningham comes , you better not call me .
i thought you'd want to thank him .
oh , i do .
i think it embarrasses him to be thanked .
why does he bring you all this stuff?
he's paying me for some legal work i did for him .
why does he pay you like this?
that's the only way he can .
he has no money .
is he poor?
yes .
are we poor?
we are , indeed .
are we as poor as the cunninghams?
no , not exactly .
cunninghams are country folks , farmers .
the crash hit them the hardest .
scout , call your brother .
atticus?
jem's up in the tree .
he says he won't come down until you agree to play football for the methodists .
jem?
son , why don't you come down out of there now and have your breakfast .
calpurnia has a good one .
hot biscuits .
not 'til you agree to play football for the methodists .
oh , son , i can't do that .
i'm too old to get out there .
after all , i'm the only father you have .
wouldn't want me to get my head knocked off , would you?
i ain't comin 'down .
suit yourself .
good morning .
good morning , miss maudie .
what's going on over there?
i'm having a terrible time , miss maudie .
jem's stayin 'up in the tree until atticus agrees to play football for the methodists .
atticus says he's too old .
every time i'm wantin 'to do something , he's too old .
he's too old for anything !
he can do plenty of things .
you be good , children .
mind cal .
'morning , maudie .
'morning , atticus .
he won't let me have a gun , and he'll only play touch football with me , never tackle .
he can make somebody's will so airtight , you can't break it .
you count your blessings and stop complaining , both of you .
thank your stars he has the sense to act his age .
jem , he is pretty old .
i can't help that .
hey .
hey , yourself .
i'm charles baker harris .
i can read .
you got anything needs readin ', i can do it .
how old are you?
four and a half?
goin 'on seven .
no wonder then .
scout's been readin 'since she was born , and she don't start school 'til next month .
you look right puny for goin 'on seven .
i'm little , but i'm old .
folks call me dill .
i'm from meridian , mississippi .
i'm spending two weeks next door with my aunt stephanie .
my mama worked for a photographer in meridian .
she entered my picture in the " beautiful child " contest and won five dollars on me .
she give the money to me , and i went to the picture show 20 times with it .
our mama's dead , but we got a daddy .
where's your daddy?
i haven't got one .
is he dead?
no .
well , if he's not dead , you've got one , haven't you?
hush , scout .
what did i do?
what did i do?
dill , this is calpurnia .
pleased to know you , dill .
pleased to know you .
my daddy owns the l& n railroad .
he's gonna let me run the engine all the way to new orleans .
is that so?
he says i can invite anybody ...
shh .
there goes the meanest man that ever took a breath of life .
why is he the meanest man?
well , for one thing , he has a boy named boo ... that he keeps chained to a bed in the house over yonder .
come on .
see?
he lives over there .
boo only comes out at night ... when you're asleep and it's pitch dark .
when you wake up at night , you can hear him .
once i heard him scratching on our screen door , but he was gone by the time atticus got there .
wonder what he does in there .
wonder what he looks like .
well ... judging from his tracks , he's about six and a half feet tall .
he eats raw squirrels and all the cats he can catch .
there's a long , jagged scar that runs across his face .
his teeth are yellow and rotten .
his eyes are popped , and he drools most of the time .
oh , i don't believe you .
dill , what are you doing here?
my lord , aunt stephanie !
you almost gave me a heart attack !
dill , i don't want you playing around that house over there .
a maniac lives there , and he's dangerous .
see?
i was trying to warn him about boo , but he wouldn't believe me .
you better believe him , mr. dill harris .
tell him about the time boo tried to kill his papa .
i was standing in my yard when his mama come out yelling , " he's killing us all !
turned out that boo was sitting in the living room cutting up the paper for his scrapbook , and when his daddy come by , he reached over with his scissors , stabbed him in his leg , pulled them out and went right on cutting the paper .
they wanted to send him to an asylum , but his daddy said , " no radley is going to any asylum .
so they locked him up in the basement of the courthouse ...
'til he nearly died of the damp ... and his daddy brought him back home .
there he is to this day , sitting over there with his scissors .
lord knows what he's doing or thinking .
six , seven , eight ,
six , seven , eight ,
nine , ten !
come on , scout !
it's 5 : 00 !
where you going?
time to meet atticus .
why do you call your daddy atticus?
'cause jem does .
why does he?
i don't know .
he just started to ever since he began talking .
wait .
stop .
miss dubose is on her porch .
listen , no matter what she says to you , don't answer her back .
there's a confederate pistol in her lap under her shawl , and she'll kill you quick as look at you .
come on .
hey , miss dubose .
don't you say " hey " to me , you ugly girl !
you say , " good afternoon , miss dubose .
you come over here when i'm talking to you .
you come over here , i said !
hi , atticus .
atticus , this is dill .
he's miss stephanie's nephew .
don't your daddy teach you to respect old people?
you come back here , jean louise finch !
good afternoon , miss dubose .
my , you look like a picture this afternoon .
he don't say a picture of what .
my goodness gracious , look at your flowers .
have you ever seen anything more beautiful?
miss dubose , the gardens at bellingrath have nothing to compare ... with your flowers .
i don't think they're as nice as last year .
he gets her interested in something nice so she forgets to be mean .
your yard is going to be the showplace of this town .
well , grand seeing you , miss dubose .
i had two cats ... which i brought ashore ... on my first raft .
and i had a dog .
atticus , do you think boo radley ever really comes and looks in my window at night?
jem says he does .
this afternoon when we were over by their house ...
scout ...
i told you and jem to leave those poor people alone .
i want you to stay away from their house ... and stop tormenting them .
yes , sir .
that's all the reading for tonight , honey .
it's getting late .
what time is it?
8 : 30 .
may i see your watch?
to atticus , my beloved husband .
atticus , jem says this watch is gonna belong to him someday .
that's right .
why?
well ... it's customary ... for the boy to have his father's watch .
what are you gonna give me?
i don't know that i have much else of value that belongs to me .
but there's a pearl necklace , there's a ring that belonged to your mother .
i put them away , and they're to be yours .
good night , scout .
good night .

yes , indeed .
how's mrs. taylor?
she's fine .
fine , thank you .
atticus , you've heard about tom robinson .
yes , sir .
grand jury will get around to charging him tomorrow .
i was thinking about appointing you to take his case .
now i realize you're very busy these days with your practice .
and your children need a great deal of your time .
yes , sir .
i'll take the case .
i'll send a boy over for you tomorrow when his hearing comes up .
well ...
i'll see you tomorrow , atticus .
yes , sir .
and thank you .
yes , sir .
hey , jem , i bet you a " grey ghost " against two " tom swifts " ... you wouldn't go any farther than boo radley's gate .
aw .

i ain't scared .
i go past boo radley's house nearly every day of my life .
always running .
you hush up , scout .
come on , dill !

i'll tell you what let's do .
let's go down to the courthouse and see the room that they locked boo up in .
my aunt says it's bat infested , and he nearly died from the mildew .
come on !
i bet they got chains and instruments of torture down there .

jem finch?
yes , sir?
if you're looking for your daddy , he's inside the courthouse .
thank you , sir , but we're not looking ...
thank you , mr. townsend .
what's your daddy doing in the courthouse?
he's a lawyer , and he has a case .
the grand jury is charging his client today .
i heard something about it last night when judge taylor came over .
let's go watch .
no , dill .
he wouldn't like that .
dill !
dill !
dill , wait a minute .
shh .
is that the courtroom?
yeah .
shh .
i can't see anything .
shh .
y'all lift me up so i can see what's going on .
all right .
make a saddle , scout .
not much is happenin '.
the judge looks like he's asleep .
i see your daddy and a colored man .
the colored man ...
shh , shh .
the colored man looks to me like he's cryin '.
i seen him with mayella .
i wonder what he's done to cry about?
what's going on?
there's a whole lot of men sittin 'together on one side , and one man keeps pointin 'at the colored man and yellin '.
they're taking the colored man away .
where's atticus?
i can't see your daddy now either .
i wonder where in the world ...
scout , jem .
what in the world are you doing here?
hello , atticus .
what are you doing here?
we came down to find out where boo radley was locked up .
we wanted to see the bats .
i want you all back home right away .
yes , sir .
run along now .
i'll see you there for dinner .
hey , howdy , cap'n .
mr. ewell .
cap'n , i'm real sorry they picked you ... to defend that nigger that raped my mayella .
i don't know why i didn't kill him myself instead of going to the sheriff .
i'd have saved you and the sheriff and the taxpayers lots of trouble .
excuse me .
i'm busy .
hey , cap'n , somebody told me just now that they thought ... that you believed tom robinson's story agin ourn .
you know what i said?
i said , " you wrong , man .
you dead wrong !
mr. finch ain't taking his story against ourn .
well , they was wrong , wasn't they?
i've been appointed to defend tom robinson .
now that he's been charged , that's what i intend to do .
you taking his story ...
if you'll excuse me , mr. ewell .
what kind of man are you?
you got children of your own .
hey , jem !
jem?
i think we ought to stay right here in miss stephanie's yard .
you don't have to come along ...
angel may .
what are you gonna do?
gonna look in a window at the radley house ... and see if we can get a look at boo radley !
come on , dill .
jem , please , i'm scared .

i swear , scout , you act more like a girl all the time .
come on , dill .
wait for me .
i'm coming .

i don't believe we can be seen from there .

good night .
good night .
good night , atticus .
oh , scared the living daylights out of me .
a prowler?
he said a prowler?
come on now .
the excitement's over .
time for bed .
scout .
jem .
'morning .
good morning , miss maudie .
'morning , calpurnia .
'morning , maudie .
came to see if jean louise is ready for her first day of school .
scout !
good morning , miss maudie .
you ready too?
yes , ma'am .
scout !
what are you gonna do this morning with both children at school?
i don't know , and that's the truth .
i was thinking about that just now .
scout !
scout?
scout !
did you hear me , scout?
now hurry .
hey , look at scout !
shh .
come on in here , scout .
have your breakfast .
i think your dress is mighty becomin ', honey .
don't go tugging at that dress , scout .
you want to have it all wrinkled before you even get to school?
i still don't see why i have to wear a darn old dress .
you'll get used to it .
i'm ready !
oh , jem .
jem .
it's half an hour before school starts .
sit right down and wait for your sister .
hurry up , scout .
i'm trying to .
come on !
it's your first day .
you want to be late?
i'm ready .
let's go !
bye .
bye , everybody !
darn you , walter cunningham !
come on , walter !
come on , walter !
scout !
come on , walter !
cut that out !
what do you think you're doing?
he made me start off on the wrong foot !
i was trying to explain to that darn lady teacher ... why he didn't have no money for his lunch , and she got sore at me !
stop it !
stop it !
is your daddy mr. walter cunningham from old sarum?
come home and have dinner with us , walter .
we'd be glad to have you .
our daddy is a friend of your daddy's .
scout here is crazy .
she won't fight you no more .
i hope that's a dinner that you enjoy .
yes , sir .
i don't know when i've had a roast .
we've been having squirrels and rabbits lately .
my pa and i go hunting in our spare time .
you got a gun of your own?
uh huh .
how long you had a gun?
oh , a year or so .
can i have the syrup , please?
certainly , son .
cal , will you bring in the syrup dish , please?
yes , sir .
how old were you when you got your first gun , atticus?
thirteen or fourteen .
i remember when my daddy gave me that gun .
he told me that i should never point at anything in the house ... and that he'd rather i shoot at tin cans in the backyard .
but he said that sooner or later he supposed ... the temptation to go after birds would be too much ... and that i could shoot all the blue jays i wanted , if i could hit 'em ; but to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird .
why?
well , i reckon ... because mockingbirds don't do anything ... but make music for us to enjoy .
don't eat people's gardens .
don't nest in the corn cribs .
they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us .
how'd you like school , scout?
all right .
oh , thank you , cal .
that's for walter .
what in the sam hill are you doing , wa ...
but , atticus , he's gone and drowned his dinner in syrup ,
and now he's pouring it all over ...
scout .
what?
come out here .
i want to talk to you .
that boy is your company .
if he wants to eat that tablecloth , you'll let him .
if you can't act fit to eat like folks , you can just sit here and eat in the kitchen .
scout .
scout .
scout , what in the world has got into you?
i'm not going back .
now , now .
atticus , i'm not going back to school anymore .
now , scout , it's just the first day .
i don't care .
everything went wrong .
the teacher got mad as the devil at me ... and said you were teaching me to read all wrong and to stop it , then acted like a fool and tried to give walter cunningham a quarter ... when everybody knows cunninghams won't take nothin 'from nobody .
any fool could have told her that .
well ... maybe she's just nervous .
after all , it's her first day teaching school and being new here .
oh , atticus ...
now , wait a minute .
if you learn this single trick , scout , you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks .
you never really understand a person ... until you consider things from his point of view .
sir?
until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it .
but if i keep going to school , we can't ever read anymore .
scout ... do you know what a compromise is?
bending the law?
uh ... no .
it's an agreement reached by mutual consent .
now ... here's the way it works .
you concede the necessity of going to school , we'll keep right on reading the same every night ... just as we always have .
that a bargain?
there just didn't seem to be ... anyone or anything atticus couldn't explain .
though it wasn't a talent that would arouse the admiration of any of our friends ,
jem and i had to admit he was very good at that .
but that was all he was good at ... we thought .
see?
there he is .
scout , jem , come on inside .
come on !
come on .
get in .
mr. finch?
this is cal .
i swear to god , there's a mad dog down the street a piece .
he's coming this way !
there he is .
he's got it , all right , mr. finch .
stay inside , son .
keep them in there , cal .
he's within range , heck .
take him , mr. finch .
oh , no , mr. tate !
he can't shoot !
don't waste time , heck .
he's got to be killed before he starts runnin '.
look where he is .
i can't shoot that well , and you know it .
i haven't shot a gun in years .
i'd feel mighty comfortable if you did now .
don't go near that dog .
he's just as dangerous dead as alive .
yes , sir .
atticus?
yes , son .
nothin '.
what's the matter , boy?
can't you talk?
didn't you know your daddy is the best shot in this county?
oh , hush , heck .
let's get back to town .
remember now , don't go near that dog .
yes , sir .
i'll send zeebo out right away to pick him up .
hey , atticus , can we go with ya?
can we , please?
huh , can we?
i have to go to the country on business , and you'll just get tired .
oh , no , not me .
i won't get tired .
well , you promise to stay in the car while i talk to helen robinson?
mm hmm .
and not nag me about leaving if you get tired?
huh uh .
all right , climb in .
who's helen robinson?
she's the wife of the man i'm defending .
good evening , david .
good evening .
good evening , helen .
'evening , mr. finch .
i came over to tell you about my visit with tom .
yes , sir .
and to let you know that i got a postponement of the trial .
would you tell my daddy to come out here , please?
you nigger lover .
no need to be afraid of him , son .
he's all bluff .
nigger lover !
there's a lot of ugly things in this world , son .
i wish i could keep 'em all away from you .
that's never possible .
cal , if you wait 'til i get scout in bed , i'll drive you home .
yes , sir .
jem , do you mind stayin 'here with scout 'til i get cal home?
no , sir .
'night , jem .
'night , cal .
atticus !
atticus !
atticus !
atticus had promised me he would wear me out ... if he ever heard of me fightin 'anymore .
i was far too old and too big for such childish things .
and the sooner i learned to hold in , the better off everybody would be .
i soon forgot .
cecil jacobs made me forget .
oh , what is it , scout?
atticus , do you defend niggers?
don't say " nigger , " scout .
i didn't say it .
cecil jacobs did .
that's why i had to fight him .
scout , i don't want you fightin '.
i had to , atticus .
he ...
i don't care what the reasons are .
i forbid you to fight .
yes .
anyway ...
i'm simply defending a negro , tom robinson .
now , scout , there are some things that ... you're not old enough to understand just yet .
there's been some high talk around town ... to the effect that i shouldn't do much about defending this man .
if you shouldn't be defending him , then why are you doing it?
for a number of reasons .
the main one is that , if i didn't ,
i couldn't hold my head up in town .
i couldn't even tell you or jem ... not to do something again .
scout .
you're gonna hear some ugly talk about this in school .
that you won't get into fights over it , no matter what they say to you .
yes , sir .
what are you doing?
i'm walking like an egyptian .
we were studyin 'about 'em in school .
teacher says we wouldn't be no place without 'em .
is that so?
cradle of civilization .
they invented embalming and toilet paper .
that's wrong , scout .
you do your feet this way .
look , jem .
look , the boy wears hair in front of his eyebrows like you do .
yeah , and the girl wears bangs like you .
these are of us .
jem , you awake?
go back to bed .
i can't go to sleep .
go back to bed .
what you got in the box?
nothin '.
go back to bed .
come on .
if i show you , will you swear never to tell anybody?
i swear .
cross your heart .
i found all of these ... in the knothole of that old tree at different times .
this is a spelling medal .
you know they used to award these in school to spelling winners ... before we were born .
and another time , i found this .
and this .
scout ... you know somethin 'else i never told you about that night i went back ...
to the radley house?
" somethin 'else "?
you never told me anything about that night .
well ... the first time when i was gettin 'out of my britches?
uh huh .
well , they was all in a tangle , and i couldn't get 'em loose .
well , when i went back , though , they were folded across the fence , sort of like they was expectin 'me .
it was to be a long time ... before jem and i talked about boo again .
school finally ended and summer came ... and so did dill .
good mornin '.
good mornin '.
my , you're up ... mighty bright and early .
ooh , i been up since 4 : 00 .
4 : 00?
oh , yes , i always get up at 4 : 00 .
it's in my blood .
my daddy was a railroad man 'til he got rich .
now he flies airplanes .
one of these days , he's just gonna swoop down here at maycomb , pick me up and take me for a ride .
who's that in the car with sheriff tate?
tom robinson , son .
where's he been?
in the abbottsville jail .
why?
the sheriff thought he'd be safer there .
they're bringin 'him back here tonight ... because his trial is tomorrow .
well , good evenin ', heck .
good evenin ', mr. finch .
come in .
the news has gotten around the county about my bringin 'tom robinson back to the jail .
i , uh , heard there might be trouble from that bunch out at old sarum .
cal , if i need you to stay here tonight , can you do it?
yes , sir , i can .
thank you .
i think you better count on stayin '.
yes , sir .
what's goin 'on?
shh .
go back to sleep .
what's goin 'on?
shh .
hey , there's his car .
there he is over there .
no , scout , don't go to him .
he might not like it .
i just wanted to see where he was and what he was up to .
he's all right .
let's go back home .
come on .
he in there , mr. finch?
he is .
he's asleep .
don't wake him .
you know what we want .
get aside from that door , mr. finch .
walter ...
i think you oughta turn right around and go back home .
heck tate's around here somewhere .
no , he ain't !
heck and his bunch is out in old sarum , lookin 'for us .
we knowed he was , so we come in this other way .
you ain't thought about that , had you , mr. finch?
i thought about it .
i can't see atticus .
well , that changes things some .

on the night of august 21 ,
on the night of august 21 ,
i was just leaving my office to go home when bob ...
mr. ewell came in .
very excited he was , and he said to get to his house as quick as i could , that his girl had been raped .
i got in my car and went out there as fast as i could .
she was pretty well beat up .
i asked her if tom robinson beat her like that .
she said , yes , he had .
i asked if he'd taken advantage of her .
she said , " yes , he did .
that's all there was to it .
thank you .
did anybody call a doctor , sheriff?
no , sir .
why not?
well , i didn't think it was necessary .
she was pretty well beat up .
somethin 'sure happened .
it was obvious .
now , sheriff , you say that she was mighty beat up .
in what way?
well , she was beaten around the head .
there were bruises already comin 'on her arms .
she had a black eye startin '.
which eye?
let's see .
it was her left .
well , now , was that , uh ...
that was her left , facing you ... or looking the way that you were?
oh , yes , that would make it her right eye .
it was her right eye , mr. finch .
now i remember .
she was beaten up on that side of her face .
which side again , heck?
the right side .
she had bruises on her arms and ... she showed me her neck .
there were definite finger marks on her gullet .
well ... all around her neck , at the back of her throat?
i'd say they were all around .
the witness may be seated .
robert e. lee ewell .
place your hand on the bible , please .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you god?
i do .
sit down , please .
now , mr. ewell , you tell us , just in your own words , what happened on august 21 .
well , that night ...
i was comin 'from the woods with a load of kindlin '... and i heard mayella screamin 'as i got to the fence .
so i dropped my kindlin ', and i run as fast as i could , but i run into the fence .
but when i got loose , i run up to the window , and i seen him with my mayella !
what did you do after you saw the defendant?
i run around the house tryin 'to get in , but he done run through the front door just ahead of me !
but i seen who it was , all right !
i seen him .
and i run in the house and ... poor mayella was layin 'on the floor squallin '.
then i run for mr. tate just as quick as i could .
mm hmm .
thank you , mr. ewell .
would you mind if i just , uh , ask you a few questions , mr. ewell?
no , sir , mr. finch , i sure wouldn't .
folks were doin 'a lot of running that night .
you say that you ran to the house , you ran to the window , you ran inside , you ran to mayella , you ran to sheriff tate .
did you , during all this running , run for a doctor?
there wasn't no need to .
i seen who done it .
now , mr. ewell , you've heard the sheriff's testimony .
do you agree with his description of mayella's injuries?
i agree with everything mr. tate said .
her eye was blacked .
she was mighty beat up , mighty beat up .
now , mr. ewell , can you , uh ... can you read and write?
yes , sir , mr. finch , i can read and i can write .
good .
then will you write your name , please .
write there .
show us .
so what's so interesting?
you're left handed , mr. ewell .
what's that got to do with it , judge?
i'm a god fearin 'man .
that atticus finch , he's tryin 'to take advantage of me !
you got to watch tricky lawyers like atticus finch !
quiet .
quiet , sir .
now the witness may take his seat .
mayella violet ewell .
put your hand on the bible , please .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you god?
sit down , please .
now , mayella ... suppose you tell us just what happened , huh?
well , sir ...
sir ...
i was s sittin 'on the porch ... and he come along .
there's this old chifforobe in the yard , and i i said ,
you come in here , boy , and bust up this chifforobe , and i'll give you a nickel .
so he come on in the yard , and i go in the house to get him the nickel ... and i turn around and before i know it , he's on me .
i fought and hollered ... but he had me around the neck ... and he hit me , again and again .
and the next thing i knew , papa was in the room ... a standin 'over me , hollerin ', " who done it?
who done it?
thank you , mayella .
your witness , atticus .
miss mayella , is your father good to you?
i mean , is he easy to get along with?
does tolerable .
except when he's drinking .
when he's riled ... has he ever beaten you?
my pa's never touched a hair on my head in my life .
you say that you asked tom to come in and chop up a ...
what was it?
a chifforobe .
was that the first time that you ever asked him to come inside the fence?
yes .
didn't you ever ask him to come inside the fence before?
i might have .
can you remember any other occasion?
no .
you say , " he caught me , he choked me , and he took advantage of me .
is that right?
do you remember him beating you about the face?
no .
i don't ... recollect if he hit me .
i mean , y yes !
h he hit me !
he hit me !
thank you .
now will you identify the man who beat you .
i most certainly will .
sittin 'right yonder .
tom , will you stand up , please?
let miss mayella have a good long look at you .
tom , will you catch this , please?
thank you .
now , then , this time , will you please catch it with your left hand .
i can't , sir .
why can't you?
i can't use my left hand at all .
i got it caught in a cotton gin when i was 12 years old .
all my muscles were tore loose .
is this the man who raped you?
it most certainly is .
how?
i don't know how .
he done it .
he just done it .
you have testified ... that he choked you and he beat you .
you didn't say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you out cold , but that you turned around ... and there he was .
do you want to tell us what really happened?
i got something to say ... and then i ain't gonna say no more !
he took advantage of me !
and if you fine , fancy gentlemen ... ain't gonna do nothing about it , then you're just a bunch of lousy , yellow , stinkin 'cowards !
the whole bunch of ya !
and your fancy airs don't come to nothin '!
your " ma'am " ing and your " miss mayella " ing , it don't come to nothin ', mr. finch !
n n ...
you sit down now .
atticus .
mr. gilmer .
the state rests , judge .
tom robinson , take the stand .
put your hand on the bible .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you god?
i do .
sit down .
now , tom ... were you acquainted with mayella violet ewell?
yes , sir .
i had to pass her place going to and from the field every day .
is there any other way to go?
no , sir .
none's i know of .
and did she ever speak to you?
why , yes , sir .
i'd tip my hat when i'd go by .
one day she asked me to come inside the fence ... and bust up a chifforobe for her .
she give me the hatchet , and i broke it up .
and then she said , " i reckon i'll have to give you a nickel , won't i?
and i said , " no , ma'am .
there ain't no charge .
and i went home .
mr. finch , that was way last spring .
way over a year ago .
did you ever go on the place again?
yes , sir .
when?
well , i went lots of times .
seemed like every time i passed by yonder , she would have some little something for me to do : chopping kindlin 'and totin 'water for her .
tom ... what happened to you ... on the evening of august 21 of last year?
mr. finch , i was going home as usual that evening .
when i passed the ewell place ,
miss mayella were on the porch , like she said she were .
she said for me to come there and help her a minute .
well , i went inside the fence , and i looked around for some kindlin 'to work on , but i didn't see none .
then she said to come in the house , she has a door needs fixin '.
so i follows her inside , and i looked at the door ... and it looked all right .
then she shut the door .
all the time i was wondering why it was so quiet .
then it come to me .
there was not a child on the place .
and i said , " miss mayella , where are the children?
she said , " they all gone to get ice cream .
she said it took her a year to save seven nickels , but she'd done it .
and they'd all gone to town .
what did you say then?
well , i said something like ...
why , miss mayella , that's right nice of you to treat 'em .
she said , " you think so?
well , i said , " i best be goin '.
i couldn't do nothin 'for her .
and she said i could .
i asked her what .
and she said to just step on the chair yonder ... and get that box down from on top of the chifforobe .
so i done like she told me , and i was reachin '... when the next thing i knows , she grabbed me around the legs .
she scared me so bad , i hopped down and turned the chair over .
that was the only thing ... only furniture ... disturbed in the room , mr. finch ,
i swear , when i left it .
and what happened after you turned the chair over?
tom?
you've sworn to tell the whole truth .
will you do it?
what happened after that?
mr. finch ,
i got down off the chair , and i turned around ... and she sorta jumped on me .
she hugged me around the waist .
she reached up and kissed me on the face .
she said she'd never kissed a grown man before ... and she might as well kiss me .
she says for me to kiss her back , and i said , " miss mayella , let me outta here , " and i tried to run .
mr. ewell cussed at her from the window .
he said he's gonna kill her .
and what happened after that?
i was runnin 'so fast , i don't know what happened .
tom , did you rape mayella ewell?
i did not , sir .
did you harm her in any way?
i did not , sir .
robinson , you're pretty good at bustin 'up chifforobes and kindlin 'with one hand , aren't ya?
strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor?
i never done that , sir .
but you're strong enough to .
i reckon so , sir .
mm hmm .
how come you so all fired anxious to do that woman's chores?
looks like she , she didn't have nobody to help her .
like i said , she ...
with mr. ewell and seven children on the place?
you did all this choppin 'and work out of sheer goodness , boy?
you're a mighty good fella , it seems .
did all that for not one penny?
yes , sir .
i felt right sorry for her .
she seemed ...
you felt sorry for her?
a white woman?
you felt sorry for her?
to begin with , this case should never have come to trial .
the state has not produced one iota ... of medical evidence ... that the crime tom robinson is charged with ... ever took place .
it has relied , instead , upon the testimony of two witnesses ... whose evidence has not only been called into serious question ... on cross examination , but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant .
there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that ...
mayella ewell was beaten savagely ... by someone who led , almost exclusively , with his left .
tom robinson now sits before you having taken the oath ... with the only good hand he possesses , his right .
i have nothing but pity in my heart ... for the chief witness for the state .
she is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance .
but my pity ... does not extend so far ... as to her putting a man's life at stake , which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt .
now i say " guilt , " gentlemen , because it was guilt that motivated her .
she's committed no crime .
she has merely broken a rigid and time honored ... code of our society ... a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst ... as unfit to live with .
she must destroy the evidence ... of her offense .
but what was the evidence of her offense?
tom robinson , a human being .
she must put tom robinson away from her .
tom robinson was to her a daily reminder ... of what she did .
now , what did she do?
she tempted a negro .
she was white , and she tempted a negro .
she did something that , in our society , is unspeakable .
she kissed a black man .
not an old uncle , but a strong , young negro man .
no code mattered to her before she broke it , but it came crashing down on her afterwards .
the witnesses for the state , with the exception of the sheriff of maycomb county . have presented themselves to you gentlemen , to this court ... in the cynical confidence ... that their testimony would not be doubted .
confident that you gentlemen would go along with them ... on the assumption ... the evil assumption ... that all negroes lie , all negroes are basically immoral beings , all negro men are not to be trusted around our women .
an assumption that one associates with minds of their caliber , and which is , in itself , gentlemen , a lie , which i do not need to point out to you .
and so , a quiet , humble , respectable negro , who has had the unmitigated temerity ... to feel sorry for a white woman , has had to put his word against two white people's .
the defendant is not guilty , but somebody in this courtroom is .
now , gentlemen , in this country , our courts are the great levelers .
in our courts , all men are created equal .
i'm no idealist to believe firmly ... in the integrity of our courts and of our jury system .
that's no ideal to me .
that is a living , working reality !
now i am confident that you gentlemen will review ... without passion ... the evidence that you have heard , come to a decision ... and restore this man to his family .
in the name of god , do your duty .
in the name of god , believe ...
tom robinson .
how long has the jury been out now , reverend?
well , let's see .
almost two hours now .
i think that's an awful good sign , don't you?
court's now in session .
everybody rise .
gentlemen of the jury ,
have you reached a verdict?
we have , your honor .
will the defendant please rise and face the jury?
what is your verdict?
we find the defendant guilty as charged .
gentlemen , this jury is dismissed .
court is adjourned .
i'll go to see helen first thing tomorrow morning .
i told her not to be disappointed , we'd probably lose this one .
tom .
yes , mr. finch .
miss jean louise .
miss jean louise , stand up .
your father's passin '.
atticus?
i i'm sorry , atticus .
well , thank you , maudie .
atticus , can i see you for a minute?
will you excuse me?
jem?
yes'm .
i don't know if it'll help , but i want to say this to you .
there's some men in this world ... who are born to do our unpleasant jobs for us .
your father's one of them .
oh , well .
what's the matter , atticus?
tom robinson's dead .
they were taking him to abbottsville ... for safekeeping .
tom broke loose and ran .
the deputy called out to him to stop , and tom didn't stop .
he shot at him to wound him and missed his aim .
killed him .
the deputy says ...
tom just ran like a crazy man .
the last thing i told him was not to lose heart , that we'd ask for an appeal .
we had such a good chance .
we had more than a good chance .
i have to go out and tell his family .
you look after the children , maudie .
atticus , you want me to go with you?
no , son , i think i'd better go out there alone .
atticus .
i'm goin 'with you .
i'm goin 'with you .
all right , son .
hello , mr. finch .
i'm spence , tom's father .
hello , spence .
is helen here?
yes , sir , she's inside lyin 'down , tryin 'to get a little sleep .
we been talkin 'about the appeal , mr. finch .
how long do you think it'll take?
spence , there isn't going to be any appeal .
not now .
tom is dead .
dead?
helen .
boy .
go inside and tell atticus finch i said to come out here .
go on , boy .
by october , things had settled down again .
i still looked for boo every time i went by the radley place .
this night my mind was filled with halloween .
there was to be a pageant representing our county's agricultural products .
i was to be a ham .
jem said he would escort me to the school auditorium .
thus began our longest journey together .
scout !
yeah?
will you come on?
everybody's gone .
i can't go home like this .
well , i'm goin '.
it's almost 10 : 00 ... and atticus will be waiting for us .
all right , i'm comin '.
but i feel like a fool walkin 'home like this .
it's not my fault you lost your dress .
i didn't lose it .
just can't find it .
where are your shoes?
i can't find them either .
you can get 'em tomorrow .
but tomorrow's sunday .
you can get the janitor to let you in .
come on .
here , scout .
let me hold onto you before you break your neck .
jem , you don't have to hold me .
shh .
what's the matter?
hush a minute , scout .
i thought i heard somethin '.
ah ... come on .
wait .
jem , are you trying to scare me?
shh .
you know i'm too old .
be quiet .
i heard an old dog bayin '.
it's not that .
i hear it when we're walking along .
when we stop , i don't hear it anymore .
oh , yeah , my costume rustlin '.
halloween's got ya .
i hear it now .
i'll bet it's just old cecil jacobs tryin 'to scare me .
cecil jacobs is a big , wet hen !
come on .
run , scout !
run , scout !
run !
run !
scout !
scout !
what happened?
what happened?
i don't know .
i just don't know .
cal , tell dr. reynolds to come over .
yes , sir .
you all right?
yes , sir .
are you sure?
yes , sir .
sheriff tate , please .
atticus , is jem dead?
no .
he's unconscious .
we won't know how badly he's hurt until the doctor gets here .
heck?
atticus finch .
someone's been after my children .
he's got a bad break .
like somebody tried to wring his arm off .
i'll be right back , atticus .
how's the boy , doc?
he'll be all right .
sheriff tate .
what is it , heck?
bob ewell's lyin 'on the ground under that tree down yonder ... with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs .
he's dead , mr. finch .
are you sure?
yes , sir .
he's not gonna bother these children anymore .
miss scout , you think you could tell us what happened?
i don't know .
all of a sudden somebody grabbed me , knocked me down on the ground .
jem found me then .
then mr. ewell , i reckon , grabbed him again , and jem hollered .
then somebody grabbed me .
mr. ewell , i guess .
somebody grabbed him ... and then i heard someone pantin 'and coughin '.
then i saw someone carrying jem .
well , who was it?
why , there he is , mr. tate .
he can tell you his name .
hey , boo .
miss jean louise , mr. arthur radley .
i believe he already knows you .
heck , let's go out on the front porch .
would you like to say good night to jem , mr. arthur?
you can pet him , mr. arthur .
he's asleep .
you couldn't if he was awake , though .
he wouldn't let you .
go ahead .
let's go set in the swing , mr. arthur .
heck , i i ...
i guess that the thing to do is , uh ...
good lord ...
i must be losin 'my memory .
i can't remember whether jem is 12 or 13 .
anyway , it'll have to come before the county court .
of course , it's a clear cut case of self defense .
i'll , uh ...
well , i'll run down to the office ...
mr. finch ... do you think jem killed bob ewell?
is that what you think?
your boy never stabbed him .
bob ewell fell on his knife .
he killed himself .
there's a black man dead for no reason .
now the man responsible for it is dead .
let the dead bury the dead this time , mr. finch .
i never heard tell it was against the law for any citizen ... to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed , which is exactly what he did .
but maybe you'll tell me it's my duty to tell the town all about it , not to hush it up .
you know what'll happen then .
all the ladies in maycomb , includin 'my wife , will be knockin 'on his door bringin 'angel food cakes .
to my way of thinkin ', takin 'one man , who done you and this town a big service , and draggin 'him with his shy ways into the limelight ...
to me , that's a sin .
it's a sin .
and i'm not about to have it on my head .
i may not be much , mr. finch , but i'm still sheriff of maycomb county , and bob ewell fell on his knife .
good night , sir .
mr. tate was right .
what do you mean?
well ... it would be ... sort of like shooting a mockingbird , wouldn't it?
thank you , arthur .
thank you for my children .
neighbors bring food with death ... and flowers with sickness ... and little things in between .
boo was our neighbor .
he gave us two soap dolls , a broken watch and chain , a knife ... and our lives .
one time atticus said ... you never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them .
just standing on the radley porch was enough .
the summer that had begun so long ago had ended , and another summer had taken its place .
and a fall .
and boo radley had come out .
i was to think of these days many times , of jem and dill ... and boo radley and tom robinson .
and atticus .
he would be in jem's room all night , and he would be there when jem waked up in the morning .
