**
the first hazard for the returning hero ... is his fame .
the adulation can spin you quite giddy .
those who once dismissed you as a lousy pork chop ... now clamor just to be in your presence .
sir !
sir !
look , sir , look !
look !
up in the sky !
look up there !
excuse me .
mr. hoggett .
mr. hoggett , sir .
mr. hoggett , sir .
your pig .
lf you'd just hold the pig up for the press .
look this way !
this way !
one more !
show us the pig !
the deeds of the farmer and his remarkable pig ... became renowned even in distant lands .
... find the time to apply for all these ...
lnvitations came from all over to open fairs ,
to demonstrate sheepherding ...
oh !
more?
and , indeed , to meet a queen .
ooh .
but arthur hoggett was a retiring man .
he found his best pleasures working his farm .
i'll need a neighbor to help me .
so it was , one morning he set out to repair the water pump ... and babe somehow got it into his head that he could help .
but fate turns on a moment , dear ones , and the pig was about to learn the meaning of those two cruel words of regret : " if only .
lf only he hadn't been so careless ; w whoa !
if only the weight of the pig and the pump did not exceed the weight of the farmer ; if only the farmer did not connect with the platform on the way up ... or jam his fingers at the top ; if only the pump hadn't fallen off at the bottom ; and if only the poor farmer had the presence of mind ... to hold onto the rope .
boss?
boss !
at no other time in his short life ... had the pig wished more that his words could be understood by humans , if only to say , " sorry , boss .
sorry , boss .
* non , rien de rien *
* non je ne regrette rien *
* ni le bien *
* qu'on m'a fait *
* ni le mal *
* tout ca m'est bien egal * * non , rien de rien **
even before her arthur's misfortune ,
mrs. hoggett was ceaselessly busy ... bustling , baking , bottling and pickling , but now , having to nurse her husband and pay the bills , she found life considerably more challenging ... than she had ever anticipated .
before long , two men showed up .
two men in suits .
men with pale faces and soulless eyes .
such men could have come from only one place : the bank .
arthur !
arthur !
where is it?
where is it?
where is it?
yes .
dear mr. arthur hoggett ... " ... guest appearance for your pig .
... sheepherding demonstration .
sheepherding demonstration?
free air travel , accommodations ... and a generous appearance fee .
oh !

babe's not here .
you can't undo what's happened , son , but you can make up for it .
babe , the boss is about to lose the farm .
we'll all be sent away .
there's no telling where we'll end up .
not every human is as kind as ours .
but what can i do?
nothing !
you're a sheep pig .
a champion , no less .
pig !
most likely they'll want you to herd sheep .
you can't leave .
he can't leave !
you're my lucky pig .
pig !
pig !
arthur !
you call the wretched thing .
come , pig !
well , i must be off , then .
you won't be alone , dear .
you'll be with the boss's wife .
oh , sure , the boss's wife .
you'll be in the company of a serial killer .
do not take counsel of your fears , lad .
do you want to pee before you go?
uh , no , thank you .
come on .
come on , pig .
b b but i need this pig .
he's my lucky pig , my good luck pig .
w w without him , l i'm dead .
deceased !
lifeless !
extinct !
a demised duck !
ln you go .
can you come with me , fly?
i wish i could , dear , but it's you they want .
please?
stop it , now .
you're a brave pig .
and , babe , more often than not in this uncertain world , fortune favors the brave .
porridge in the morning .
no sugar .
a little bit of salt , but not too much .
tea .
no milk , just lemon .
okay , i think that's everything .
right .
i'm off .
esme?
don't worry , arthur .
i won't let anything happen to your pig .
arthur .
and so , dear ones , the pig and the farmer's wife ... ventured into the larger world .
what follows is an account of their calamitous adventures ... and how a kind and steady heart ... can mend a sorry world .
save the farm , babe !
save the farm !
save the f a a a a a rm !

ohh ohh whoa !
u um um
uh , uh , excuse me .
excuse me , but i was wondering  hey , look , pal , i'm busy .
uh , well , i seem to have lost my human .
hey , hey , i'm workin 'here .
capisce?
comprende?
whoa .
ain't you a weird lookin 'puppy .
i'm not a puppy .
i'm a sheep pig .
my human's gone , and i'm hungry , and i'm supposed to save the farm .
yeah , that's truly tragic , but you see that long line of stuff over there?
and all those piles yonder?
you see 'em?
yes .
well , i gotta sniff every doggone one of 'em .
i'm a sniffer , ya see .
a fully qualified , triple certificated sniffer .
oh .
it's all in the hooter , the schnozz , the olfactory instrument .
you could be a sniffer with a schnozz like that .
that's very kind of you , but
don't interrupt me now .
i'm just gettin 'to the good part .
when you sniff the right smell , do ya know what happens?
mm mmm .
you jump up and down and go berserk .
that's what happens .
you should see the humans come runnin '.
they do?
why?
beats me , but it's sure important .
i get big rewards .
rewards?
sure .
my heart's desire .
watch this .
security guard , to the floor !
security guard , come to the floor !
we got one .
she could be my mother .
creepy , isn't it?
esme cordelia hoggett?
oh .
thank heaven .
my pig hasn't come through , and i've only got 15 minutes to make flight ff 115 .
i've got to get to the other terminal , but there's no point me going without the blessed pig .
ma'am , we have the pig .
oh .
let's get a wriggle on , then .
oh . lf we miss ff 115 , then we won't make the 4 : 15 shuttle .
and if we don't make the 4 : 15 shuttle , we won't make it in time for the fair .
it's the grandaddy of all state fairs , they say , and today's the very last day .
it'll all be over and we won't get the appearance money , and if we don't get the money the bank won't take , " sorry , i missed my flight " for an answer .
that'll be it .
all over .
arrivederci , farm .
poor arthur would be utterly ... devastated .
esme cordelia hoggett , we have reason to believe you may be carrying illegal substances on your person .
being an officer of the drug enforcement agency ,
i am authorized by law to conduct certain ... procedures .
please step into the cubicle and remove your clothes .
pardon?
of course , it was proved beyond any doubt ... that esme cordelia hoggett was not a felon .
but , sadly , they had missed their all important connection , and to make matters worse ... they were obliged to wait some days for the next flight home .
they couldn't go forward , and they couldn't go back .
they were stranded .
a and so , you don't take pets .
but he's just a little pig .
well , it's more of a dog , really .
but it's practically human !
**
**
**
uh huh?
scram , lady .
this is not a farm .
excuse me .
flealands hotel , a few blocks south .
you'll be welcome there .
esme hoggett studied the face of the stranger ...
thank you . and wondered what could have provoked his unexpected act of kindness .
* when the moon hits your eye *
* like a big pizza pie *
* that's amore *
* when the world seems to shine *
* like you've had too much wine *
* that's amore *

oh .
i need a room for myself ... and , uh , the , uh , wee pig .
huh?
are you crazy?
animals in here?
what makes you think we take animals?
oh , but l
what kind of establishment do you think this is?
well , it isn't .
am i aware of the city codes and regulations?
yes .
am i one to break the law?
absolutely not .
i am very lawful .
are you hearing impaired?
go away !
psst !
psst !
mmm?
how long did you want to stay?
i , uh two days .

uh well , i thought you
that was just for the neighbors .
heartless meanies .
where do they expect these poor creatures to go?
ls he house trained?
oh , yes .
just like you and me .
do we provide meals?
no .
but is there a convenience store?
yes .
two blocks south .
and what is the golden rule?
never answer the front door .
why?
it might be an inspector .
mind that step .
what happens if you need anything?
you knock on this door on the left .
who lives there?
i do .
where's the bathroom?
end of the landing .
do we provide towels?
what is that , a canine?
huh?
you canine?
little puppy dog?
flealick , come back .
we don't know where it's been .
do we , alan?
no , nigel .
feline .
you're a cat?
do i look like a cat?
how do i know?
i got the myopia .
i can barely see .
lf you're a cat , you gotta scat .
hey !
kitty !
you got no business being on this floor !
you got that?
no felines on this floor .
period !
where's the pay phone?
ln the foyer .
local calls only .
and where does the little piggy stay at all times?
ln the room .
** * meow , meow , meow , meow meow , meow , meow *
and where does the dear little fella do his necessaries?
ln the kitty litter .
who empties it?
you do .
any questions?
oh .
where do i make a long distance phone call?
oh , uh , two blocks south .
mm hmm .
oh .
stay , pig .
stay .
babe looked out across this vast habitat , abundant with humans and other creatures , and wondered when he would see his first sheep .
maybe it wasn't sheepherding .
maybe something else was required of him .
whatever the case , in this place with its dark corners and endless possibilities , the pig felt sure he would find a way to redeem himself .
aww .
can uh , can i help you?
what are you doing?
i beg your pardon?
h hey .
uh , w wait a minute .
but
uh , that belongs to the boss's wife .
hey , that come back !
uh , hey !
wait up !
oh oh oh oh oh , yeah !
whoa .
lf you're not a cat , stay and chat .
sorry .
we don't get out much on account of nig and al and their nerves .
they're a little nervous .
me , on account of the hips .
well , don't be a stranger .
it was
open up , please .
o open this door !
you got a problem , sweetie?
uh l  who is it , honey?
it's , uh , kind of a baldy , pinky , whitey thingy .
show 'im in .
announcer , lndistinct )
i'd like the bag back , please .
hey , pinkness , look at the little guy .
you wanna break his heart?
but it doesn't belong to him .
tug comes in with the bag , just doin 'his job , collectin 'stuff , and you barge in here " accusicating " and making " demandments .
i didn't see you with the bag .
who's to say it belongs to you?
i'm not leaving without the bag .
i don't think my big brother , bob bobalooba , the big banana , is " mis splaining " how things work around here .
i may be small , but i can be ferocious if provoked .
and what have we here?
well , uh , we're in a negotiation ... with this naked , pink individual .
he's of foreign extraction , your honor .
possibly even an alien .
you drooling imbeciles .
this is an omnivorous mammal of the order ungulata , an inconsequential species with no other purpose ... than to be eaten by humans .
this lowly , handless , deeply unattractive mud lover ... is a pig .
oh .
for your information ,
i'm a sheep pig , and i've been sent to save the farm .
come to think of it , i should be saving the farm right now .
a and if you can't say anything nice , don't say anything at all .
so , will this little pink " lunchness " ... fulfill his destiny , nourishmentally speaking?
we shall see .
i feel very uncomfortable with this conversation .
i want my bag back .
get out of my way !
uncle fugly !
uncle fugly !
uncle fugly !
huh?
please let me out .
uncle fugly !
there's been a theft upstairs .
can you imagine?
esme hoggett , fugly floom .
uncle fugly , esme hoggett .
perhaps we should call the police .
no , no .
no police .
no authorities .
it would be the end of this place .
surely you understand .
oh , dear .
i just phoned my arthur to tell him that at least his pig was safe .
now , on top of everything else  hey !
that's my human !
remember , we have found your clothes .
i don't care about clothes .
but the pig i can't go home without the pig .
did you get that?
approximately five minutes ago something that looked like a pig exited this establishment .
where did he go?
left on canal street , and then in the direction of the beach .
okay .
thank you .
* meow * **
* meow , meow * **  what's that?
it's beautiful .
oh , it's lovely .
* meow , meow * **  ohh !
* they all ran after the farmer's wife *
* she cut off their tails with a carving knife *
* did you ever see such a sight in your life *
* as three blind mice **
**

aaaaah !
whoa !
ohh !
oh , dear .
ohh !
**
show business may not be as honorable a profession as sheepherding , but the pig was willing to endure the ridicule ... if it would help put things right back at hoggett hollow .
and the animals had told him if all went well ... there would be big rewards .
uh , h hey , so , when do i get paid?
shh !
**
sir , i gotta get going now .
how do i collect my reward?
i told you , stay under the table !
yep .
okay , uh uh
* non , rien de rien *
* non , je ne regrette rien *
* ni le bien *
* qu'on m'a fait *
* ni le mal *
* tout ca m'est bien egal *
* non , rien de rien *

**  take your hands off me !
oh oh ohh !
it's a mistake !
i'm a grandmother !
somebody help , please !

okay , freak show's over !
finished !
come on !
help !
help !
just tell me .
there is no reward , is there?
was there ever such a thing?
oh , little pink thingy , this is the city .
as bob always says what do you say , bob?
it's all illusory it's ill , and it's for losers .
naw , that wasn't it .
you know , that stuff about no yesterday and no tomorrow .
all you got is this actual " now ness .
the past is gone , and as for the future
yeah .
no guarantees , my little pork pie .
it's a dog eat dog world and there's not enough dog to go around .
so you look after number whatsy .
get my drift?
i'm not a pork pie .
whatever you say , cutie pie .
i'm not any kind of pie .
i'm just a pig on a mission .
**
it's tough if you're a pig alone in the city .
it can leave you empty .
and whom do you turn to?
where was the boss's wife?
he thought it might help if he could recall fly and rex and their steadfast words , and he tried really hard , but he could barely remember the face of his beloved boss .
the farm was fading .
it had become just a comforting dream , an echo .
**
* ls your heart filled with pain *
* shall i come back again *
* tell me , dear *
* are you lonesome *
* tonight *
* whoo ooh hoo hoo whoo oooh **
huh?
are we okay , thelonius?
thelonius?
i couldn't wake him .
i tried .
but he wouldn't wake up .
he'll be back .
himself always comes back .
thelonius?
easy , let him be .
let's see .
mm hmm .
whoa , whoa , wait a minute .
uh , this looks good .
yeah , just drop me off , uh yeah , right here'll be fine .
uh , thanks for the ride , pal .
i just hope you get that operation for your wing .
yeah , right , uh huh .
i mean , not being able to fly long distances , on top of the amount of family tragedies you've suffered
oh , my gosh !
yeah , yeah .
don't sweat it .

farewell , noble duck .
okey dokey , you are cleared for landing .
here we go .
flaps down ohh !
perfect .
oh .
hmm huh?
h hey !

huh?
whoa !
pig .
pig .
by nightfall , all babe's concerns ,  all the troubled voices in his head were drowned out by one insistent moan .
food .
the fact is , babe's belly was making such a fuss ... he began to believe it was talking to him .
food !
huh?
anybody got any food?
anybody?
hey , dogs , you got any edibles , any nibbly dibblies?
we got a carpet here with some nice spaghetti stains .
but we can't keep licking the carpet , can we , alan?

hey , cats !

* no , no , no , no food no food , no food *
* no food , no food we have no food **
well , then , i'm gonna get " proactivated .

just keep them occupied till we get the necessaries .
okey dokey .
hello?
hello?

hortense , you'll miss the aria ! **  hortense !
hmph !
aah !
i'm gonna catch me !
i'm gonna catch me !
aaah !
whoa ohh !
something broke through the terror flickerings , fragments of his short life , the random events that delivered him to this , his moment of annihilation .
as terror gave way to exhaustion ,
why?
aaah !
this is what happens , alan , on the outside .
it's the times , nigel .
honey , come away .
please , someone , give us a hand !
please !
kind sir?
kind sir?
can you help me?
i have been cruelly cast out and have nowhere to go .
oh , b but how?
please .
please .
i know you're different from the others .
those that have had their way with me make their empty promises , but they are all lies lies .
but , uh  i'm cold .
and i'm afraid and terribly , terribly tired .
where's your human?
my humans belong to someone else now .
someone younger and prettier .
i , uh , l i never , ever had a h h human .
i'm hungry .
my human tied me in a bag and throwed me in the water .
my tummy hurts .
try not to think about it .
take pity on us .
we are the excluded and have nowhere to go .
well , uh , it is nice and warm inside .
not a good idea .
oh , but they
no .
no .
no ness .
uh , could that be food?
oh , have mercy .
quiet .
quiet !
you'll bring all manner of trouble .
uh , perhaps if we all went inside and we all line up ,
i'm sure there'll be enough to go around .
you're talkin 'as if you're the word around here .
i'd say he is .
whatever the pig says goes .
anyone hostile to the notion?
no !
no , no !
no problem !
whatever the pig says , yeah !
anybody else?
fine by moi .
anybody else else?
it's still just a pig .
well , fluff my fur .
this recalls the glory days ... when i was dizzy with privilege .
i had my hair styled and my nails manicured each and every day .
freeloaders .
riffraff with no manners .
they'll soil willy nilly , won't they , alan?
willy nilly , nigel .
hey .
swine .
i want you to have this collar .
um ... that's not necessary .
yes , it is .
uh , you're very kind , but
no , no , i'm anything but kind .
ln fact , i have a professional obligation to be malicious .
then you should change jobs .
i can't .
yes , you can .
no , no , it's in the bloodline .
we were once warriors .
now there's just the urge .
a murderous shadow lies hard across my soul .
so ...
should i have let you drown?
most would have .
pig , if you were to wear my collar , it would honor me .
yeah .
thank the pig .
thank you , pig .
you're welcome .

hey !

listen  hey !
the chief has somethin 'to say .
um , well , uh , maybe cats and dogs ... could , um , you know , be nicer to each other .
right .
it is decreed that all cats and dogs ... put aside their instinctive and fanatical abhorrence of each other ... and that all creatures , great and diminutive , shall be of equal stature , with rights to liberty and justice ...
* that nobody can deny *
and so say all of us .
i'm still hungry .

um ...

and so , dear ones , this topsy turvy night ... was to end with a beginning .
this event , that weaves a thread from past to future , soothed the tired hearts of those assembled ... and , for a while at least , they put aside their uncertainties .

well done !
congratulations , mom .

they're so cute .

ferdinand the duck , witness to insanity .
" chaos ...
revisited . " re revisited .
oops .
sorry .
sometimes we discover our talents only through necessity .
babe , who never used his nose for anything but the piggish pursuit of food , soon found he could make his way through the trickiest of smellscapes .
as the morning wore on , he became quite the virtuoso .
it's close .
it's close .
we're getting close .
yes , it's this way .
hmph !
tourists .
i do believe we're here .
dr. collins , please report to
ohh .
dead .
i knew it .
they're all dead .
they're not dead .
well , let's go get 'em .
flealick , if we get caught , we won't be able to help anybody .
oh , yes , i've given myself a good , hard talking to , let me tell you .
i said to myself , esme , you have let arthur , yourself and the pig down .
the judge had never heard anyone speak so many words in so short a time .
evidently , this was a woman ... of clear conscience and good intent .
i used to dismiss pigs , but then a pig became my husband's best friend .
besides , he grew up on a farm and had a fondness for pigs .
you can bind me in chains , but the minute i'm free i shall march back into those streets ... and search for my arthur's pig !
case dismissed !
hello?
hello?
it's the pinkness !
all right !
thingy !
chief !
oh , i knew he'd come .
hot diggety doggie doo !
shh !
we have to be quiet .
sorry .
uh , sorry .
i'll go lock up .
all right .
okay , okay .
you all know the term " survival of the fastest .
well , i've got an idea .
we split into two groups .
the fast ones come with me .
the slow ones stay behind and sacrifice themselves .
ferdinand !
that way we don't all die .
i think that's only reasonable , don't you?
wh where's thelonius?
what are you doing?
i , l i'm not dressed .
but , thelonius , you're an orangu thingy .
well , i'm not dressed .
mr. thelonius?

people kept an eye out for each other .
they really did .
but now , i'm away for just one night ... with my uncle fugly on his deathbed

ln this whole wide world , is there anywhere that's truly safe?

thank you .

thank you .
thank the pig .
pig , you get here now ! **
you can't always put things back together as they were , but you can look to something afresh .
at least , that's what the two ladies decided .
so it was , the hotel was rented out .
and this provided for a curious arrangement .
i just can't stand it anymore !
roger !
roger !
**
the money from the hotel ... allowed the hoggetts to keep the farm from the bank .
race you home , alan .
you betcha , nigel .
and so it was , the pig brought the two worlds together .
two broken halves to make something afresh ... in a place just a little to the left of the 20th century .
**
the chimpanzees left show business behind ... and were able to be chimpanzees .
as you would expect , the air agreed with them immeasurably .
although the others got a taste for country life ,
flealick found the pace too slow ... and took to chasing trucks .
* are you lonesome tonight * sad to say ,
**  the thing between the pit bull and pink poodle didn't last .
she ran off with another dog and left him with the kids .
kids , you got to be scary .
you're warriors .
give me your snarl .
but , dad , do we have to?
we don't want to .
**
* when i kissed you *
* and called you sweetheart *
* do the chairs in your parlor *
* seem empty and bare *
**  as for the orangutan , he insisted on staying at the farmhouse ... with herself .
* and picture me there *
* ls your heart filled with pain *
* shall i come back again *
* tell me , dear *
* are you lonesome *
* tonight **
and finally , dear ones , the pig and the farmer ... were content again in each other's company .
and things were back to where they started , more or less .
hmm .
that'll do , pig .
that'll do .
* a kind and steady heart *
* can make a gray sky blue *
* and a task that seems impossible *
* ls quite possible for you *
* a kind and steady heart *
* ls sure to see you through *
* it may not seem like very much right now *
* but it'll do , it'll do *
* when you find yourself in the middle of a storm *
* and you're tired and cold and wet *
* and you're looking for a place that's cozy and warm *
* you'll make it if you never forget *
* a kind and steady heart *
* can conquer doubt and fear *
* a little courage goes a long , long way *
* gets you little bit further down the road each day *
* and before you know it you'll hear someone say *
* that'll do , babe *
* that'll do *
* a kind and steady heart *
* ls sure to see you through *
* a little courage goes a long , long way *
* gets you little bit further down the road each day *
* and before you know it you'll hear someone say *
* that'll do *
* that'll do *
* that'll do , babe *
* that'll do **
thank you for staying till the end .
bye bye .
