... little car takes first ... and third place !
a lot of herbie fans here today wearing herbie's colors .
what the heck happened to you?
i'm sorry , crazy dave .
i had a few problems getting this critter on the truck .
please .
i've blown bigger things out my nose .
prettier too .
what was that? !
i wouldn't insult him if i was you .
he's sensitive .
he's a car .
yeah , i know .
it's that he's proud .
that's all i'm saying .
the shed i got him out of was just full of these old trophies .
i think he used to be a racecar .
a racecar?
yeah .
you know , i bet it took first place at the ugly anapolis 500 .
oh !
oh !
oh , ow !
what did ...?
it wasn't the car !
all right .
just be calm .
i don't have to take this .
this is just a car ... an inanimate object .
oh ...
are you kidding?
it just leaked all over my shoe !
just get this thing off my truck !
you are so in the crusher .
push !
come on !
come on !
ahh !
whoa !
whoa !
oh !
oh ...
i'm ... just gonna ...
i got to go !
hey !
hey , you ...
all right .
listen up , car .
no one makes a fool out of crazy dave .
no one .
consider yourself crushed !
fun , fun , fun ]
marie peters .
derek parker .
gregory petell .
chad peterson .
margaret peyton .
yeah !
congratulations .
i've seen some photo finishes in my time .
that was cutting it close .
ok , dad .
getting dizzy .
oxygen deprived .
your mom would be so proud .
you're the first peyton to graduate college .
one where you don't have to keep a toolbox at the end .
where's ray?
running some laps .
we got a qualifying race .
he's working on some problems .
like not crashing?
mag wheels !
check out what mom and dad got me for graduation .
oh , great .
rub it in .
4 . 2 v 8 , right?
v 8 , what?
i don't know , but it's adorable !
promise you'll look after maggie in new york .
we'll be roommates for 1 5 minutes .
an assistant producer job at espn .
you'll be in front of the camera in a heartbeat .
have a great time in paris .
bye .
be back in a month .
i'll spring you from riverside .
we'll cruise to the big apple and start our new lives .
au revoir !
i promised your brother we'd meet him at the track .
we got to go .
do i even get a graduation lunch?
well , this isn't quite what i had in mind , but ...
hey , i sprung for the churros .
dad , is sally still sponsoring you?
one of the proud , the few .
hey , guys !
congrats on the espn job !
thank you .
i thought maggie might swing some free publicity over there .
only publicity team peyton needs is to win a race .
we're turning this thing around .
i know it .
believe me .
aw , come on , ray .
what are you doing?
ray , what ...?
ow .
ray , you were just pushing the right front .
was that what it is?
did you learn that in college?
thanks !
at least he loses with style .
he's sure had enough practice .
i can't believe trip murphy won daytona .
he's a loser .
a well paid loser .
hey , ray , the guy's a great racer .
say what you want about him .
he has excellent focus .
focus .
you drove past that tree on purpose .
no .
we're taking a shortcut .
you were gonna chop it down .
we tried to knock it down by crashing a car into it ...
oh , wait !
that was you !
oh , right .
i'm not the one who crashes into walls , am l?
don't let him get to you .
the important thing is when you see that tree and this town in your rearview mirror , you know you're on your way to a better life .
right?
right .
all right .
now you , gramps , had style .
he sure did .
listen .
i'm sorry i didn't really pull out all the stops for graduation .
it's ok .
you know , that was always mom's department .
it's been ten years .
i should have more of a clue .
i didn't know the team was doing so badly .
maggie , it's a bad streak .
we'll pull out of it .
but i do think it's time we find room for you up on that wall .
that ought to do it justice .
night , dad .
night , baby .
tomorrow morning , getting you a graduation present .
it's ok .
i really don't need anything .
i want to .
first thing , bright and early , you and me .
you get to pick it out .
ok .
good night .
good night .
dad , uh , what are we doing here?
buying you a car .
i appreciate the gesture , but i'm only here a month .
you don't want me chauffeuring you around for a month .
happy graduation , magpie .
hey , dave !
wow .
a stock car .
one lap to go .
maggie peyton is about to make nascar history .
she's going !
she's going !
she's done it !
unbelievable !
she's the first female driver to take the nextel cup !
wow !
hey , maggie !
you find anything yet?
not yet , dad !
still looking !
ok , honey .
what do you think , hon?
nothing calls out to me .
now , trust me .
there's a certified pre owned champion out there waiting to be discovered .
a car with the guts , the character , the heart of a thoroughbred .
dad !
it's perfect !
ok , just think , if this horn hadn't gone off ,
i wouldn't have found this nissan !
hey , maggie .
what about this guy?
these are great .
take care of the engine , they run forever .
doesn't really need anything .
it's cute .
but , dad ...
how much for the nissan?
good eye .
good eye .
we've had a lot of interest in that car this week .
but , um ...
i'll tell you what i'm gonna do .
since you are the first customer today ,
i think i can cut you a deal .
hmm .
i'll give you 50 for the bug .
sorry , no can do .
see ...
i always felt there was something special about that car .
i wouldn't sell in a million years .
seventy five .
oh , sold !
i'll make out the papers .
at least we know the horn works .
ok , mags .
tires are good .
gas is good .
brakes are good .
look at that .
the speedometer goes up to 200 miles an hour .
somebody's got a sense of humor .
all right , now .
come over to the garage later .
have augie take a look at it .
thank you , dad .
please take care of herbie .
whatever your problem , he'll help you find the answer .
great .
a fortune cookie on wheels .
ok , let's start slow .

come on , car !
you're a car !

i haven't seen you since high school .
what are you doing here?
oh , i just got this car .
my dad wanted to get me something for graduation .
didn't you used to drive cars with a little bit more , uh ... muscle?
this car is not for racing .
it's for regular driving .
for show .
yeah .
oh , man .
you know what?
it's not worth it .
i'm gonna take it back to crazy dave .
good to see you , kevin .
yeah , good to see you .
hey , mags .
i could fix it for you .
oh , no , that's ok .
no .
that's what i do .
kevin's custom car shop .

no .
just the basics .
we'll take him for a test drive , see what we got to work with .
sorry for almost running you over .
don't do that again .
whoa !
whoa !
ok .
all right .
easy , mags .
smooth ride .
sorry .
do you know where we could get some new shocks?
uh ...
there's a car show at the fairplex .
we could borrow parts from the hernandez brothers .
yeah , i'm not really up for that whole scene .
what?
you used to tear it up there .
well , i mean , that was then .
besides , this bucket of bolts couldn't make it down there .
whoa !
that's the maggie i know !
what are you talking about?
i'm not doing this !

ok , mags !
oh , my god .
it has more horsepower than i expected .
are you kidding me?
he just took off .
he?
herbie !
ok , the car's name is herbie?
it wasn't my first choice .
name came with the car .
let's strip it down , get rid of old parts .
maybe there's something to salvage .

it's you guys .
my fans .
and now , i'm going to give you that same experience in your very own living rooms .
crash?

oh , wow .
you guys are in for a real treat .
it's my new video game .
undefeated .
all right .
you got a sports illustrated shoot in an hour .
no sweat .
i'll do two laps .
keep the sharpies handy .
and when women give you their numbers , get photos .
i don't want a replay of phoenix .
i do enough charity work already .

trip murphy signed my head !
where are you going?
anywhere but here .
i'm not gonna be embarrassed again .
what about the car?
crazy dave can keep his cash .
i'll stick with my board .
you can't just leave it here .
hello?
look around .
somebody will take it .
what is with this car?
like it's trying to embarrass me ...
look at this .
some guy named maxx left these in the trunk ...
you look great .
you got a tiny little spot on your shirt .
what happened?
you're gonna change into those?
stand guard .
no peeking .
don't flatter yourself .
no peeking .
oh .
hey .

all zipped up .
let's go .
wait .
where are the keys?
uh , they're in the ...
oh !
oh , whoa .
take it easy , guy .
all you gotta do is ask .
i'd wear a helmet too if my ride looked like that .
oops .
come on .
let's get out of here .
good idea , loser .
get this car back to the circus before bozo puts out an apb .
ha ha .
good stuff .
oh , my god !
ok .
ok , ok !
what are you ...?
take it easy .
oh ...
oh !
ohhh !
oh , dude !
what did you do?
i swear to god , i did not do that !
ok , try telling that to him .
race !
race !
race !
race !
trip !
you gonna take that?
race , race , race !
i can't race .
get out there and tell them i'm sorry !
i love that i have to do this .
sure .
'cause trip and i have such a good rapport .
race !
race !
race !
what have i got to lose?
it's a bug .
open .
oh , my god !
kevin !
kevin !
help me !
kevin !
kevin !
mags !
what are you doing?
kevin !
what is going on?
i don't want to race !
kevin !
kevin !
race , race , race , race !
what are you trying to do , you crazy little car?
born to be wild ]
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
ok .
so that's how you want to do it?
i thought you said you hadn't been racing .
that was unbelievable !
i know .
unbelievable .
hey , trip .
what do you say?
get that camera out of my face !
did you see me come off that guardrail?
i saw ...
i don't know how you did that .
all right .
this is gonna sound strange , but it wasn't me .
i think it was herbie .
herbie is a car .
you always said they had personalities .
yeah , personalities .
they're not possessed .
i can't explain it , but when trip blocked me on that final turn ,
i wished i was on my skateboard so i could rail slide past .
then herbie did it .
it was like we were connected .
that makes perfect sense .
cuckoo !
what are you doing?
checking to make sure exhaust fumes haven't gone back inside the car .
kevin , i beat the reigning nascar champion in a '63 bug !
how else do you explain that?
how about , you're an amazing racer and proved it?
why are you afraid to admit that?
you beat trip murphy , on your own , with this ... hunk of junk .
ow !
hey .
admit it .
it felt great to be behind the wheel again .
yeah .
it did .
that's what i thought .
the family's been in racing for 40 years .
i won't let guys in suits tell me what to do .
these guys pay our bills .
what do they know about racing?
they know not to back a losing team !
another sponsor bite the dust?
they come , they go .
that's business .
you got in late last night .
let me direct you to the date of birth on my license .
let me direct you to the address on that license .
my house , my rules .
hey , guys !
hey , sally .
hey , sal .
don't tell me you're pulling out too .
no .
i'm making your day .
you're gonna love this .
taking the sports world by storm .
here it is again .
our exclusive footage of trip murphy just getting scorched in an impromptu street race .
the competition was a 1963 volkswagen beetle .
that's right , folks .
a '63 bug .
i'll be back .
dad !
what did i do?
i sense you're looking for an explanation .
you promised , no more street racing .
listen to me .
i almost lost you once .
i'm not gonna let that happen again .
at least let me explain first .
ok , go ahead .
i'm all ears .
i ran into kevin .
kevin?
you aren't in town 24 hours , and goofy kevin talks you into street racing again .
maggie .
do you think i busted my butt to put you through school so you could get back behind the wheel of a racecar?
dad , i wasn't even driving .
who was?
it was kevin's friend , maxx , who was driving .
they wanted to challenge trip , so i let them borrow the car , and it was a one shot deal .
promise?
i mean , yeah .
yeah .
sorry .
i'm sorry too .
whoever this maxx guy is , must be pretty good if he beat trip murphy in a little thing like that .
not bad .
more than a feeling ]
life's a trip .
then you drive .
cut .
i nailed that one .
i agree .
i'd love to try one more .
it doesn't get much better than that .
ok .
moving on !
can i talk to you?
what is it?
the sponsors are all over me , and the espn special is down the drain because you banished the film crew .
i won't talk about yesterday .
i'm not .
i'm talking about tomorrow .
this is your future .
those people paid for it ,
so get your head in the game ...
i can't deal with this , larry !
good hustle , everybody .
good hustle .
it doesn't make any sense .
how could that thing beat me?
nobody cares about a stupid street race .
i care .
i'm a nextel cup series champion who got beat by a volkswagen bug .
yes .
you're a champion on the track , where it counts .
this is nothing !
the reporters get some laughs out of it .
by thursday , everybody will forget it happened .
i've been up all night going over this race .
i outclassed him on every front .
i want a rematch .
aw , jeez .
trip , no .
it's me , your brother .
forget it .
a two day racing event where i beat all comers and then destroy that little bug .
i want posters at every garage , body shop and auto parts store , and full page ads in the local rags .
how do you know this maxx guy would show up?
maxx is a racer .
he'll show .
i'm gonna exterminate this bug .
hey .
where you been?
look at this .
i want to show you something .
huh?
21 80 engine .
dual weber carburetors .
front , rear swing axles .
pretty sweet , huh?
yeah , they're , um ...
wow .
you really put a lot of thought into this .
there's potential in this car .
we can turn him into a champion .
it'll take work , but , uh , there's a race in lancaster in a few weeks .
whoa .
hold on a second .
the other day was great .
i don't know how it happened , but it was a fluke .
you loved being back behind the wheel .
yeah , i did , but now i'm moving to new york and i'm starting a new life and ...
how are you gonna move to new york , a city where you take a subway to work?
listen , i told my dad no more racing , and i ended up lying to him .
the last time that happened , i ended up in the hospital .
note the vicious afterschool special cycle i'm trying to break here .
i need cash for my apartment .
those are the classifieds .
listen , kev , i'm really sorry .
i know , i know .
what about herbie?
i guess i'll drop off the keys and the number to an exorcist .
what?
maggie , what happened?
are you all right?
i know what you're thinking .
it's one race , mags .
one race , ten grand .
that's a lot of cash .
ok .
we'll split it .
you got rent money to pay .
i got this dump to fix up .
everybody wins .
what do you say?
maxx?
magic ]
come on , herbie .
hey !
sorry .
it's all right .
yeah !
i have been over every inch of this model ten times .
i've run all the tests .
there's no way an ordinary vw engine like this could have smoked yours .
there's nothing ordinary about this bug .
i don't know what it's got under its hood , but i intend to find out .
those guys always use you to get me to do something .
you can't let them drop us .
it'll break ray's heart .
no .
it's gonna break your heart .
when are you gonna open your eyes?
ray junior is not cut out for racing .
i have held out as long as i can .
bass pro is dropping you .
i'm sorry .
wait a minute , sally .
wait , please .
tell them to hold on until the speedway races .
lf ray doesn't place , i'm out .
i close up shop .
i'll sell motor oil .
i'll do something .
how long you been standing here?
long enough .
i sure am glad you're not part of this .
at ieast i did something right .
why do i feel like we just got sentenced to five to ten?
i'm gonna go sign us in .
maggie peyton .
haven't seen you in a long time .
who you here for?
" ln the way ray "?
actually , i'm sponsoring maxx .
so , do you like the makeover?
you can take the car out of the junkyard , maggie , but you can't take the junkyard out of the car .
how do you know this maxx?
um , we go way back .
i'd like to meet him .
can you arrange a face to face?
he's meditating .
getting in the zone .
sure .
pressure's getting to him?
he's not worried .
he beat you once .
beginner's luck .
you tell that to yourself at night in your trip murphy pajamas?
look , you tell maxx i'm really looking forward to the rematch .
oh , hey .
sorry , big fella .
i'm so sick of all this trip murphy cra ...
geez .
hey .
see you later , trip .
i don't know if i can do this .
time to suit up , maxx .
walking on sunshine ]
walking on sunshine ]
race fans , please welcome our own trip murphy .
we've got 200 names up there .
by the end of the day , there will be only one .
yeah !
and that driver will face me , and have a chance to win $1 0, 000 .
let's race .
ladies and gentlemen , today's winner goes up against trip murphy tomorrow !
herbie !
vroom , vroom !
let me hear you say " hey , yo !
what a day .
the real wild card here is the enigmatic racer known only as maxx .
questions abound .
who is maxx?
where did he come from?
what's with the helmet?
gotcha , maxx .
i've signed so many autographs , my hand is numb .
guess who wants an interview .
hello ]
how'd you get over here?
what's wrong?
wow .
maggie , you ...
look amazing .
i mean , you know , for someone who changed in a port a potty .
come on .
i know there's a compliment in there somewhere .
i think i'm losing my mind .
that was my first reaction .
and then i embraced the mystery that is herbie .
she's too young for you .
i got to tell you ... ... winning definitely suits you .
oh , i got you something .
it's stupid .
it's for luck tomorrow .
it's amazing .
evening .
i hardly recognized you without your camera crew .
i decided to give them the night off .
can we talk?
alone?
you ok?
yeah .
your driver did pretty well , for an amateur .
but he's got some serious flaws .
take his car , for instance .
the chassis's too high , and ... ... the aerodynamics are all wrong .
thanks for the tip .
i'll pass it on to maxx .
you know what i can't figure out?
why you're not behind the wheel .
i hear you were a heck of a street racer back in the day .
ancient history .
i doubt it .
it's in your blood .
your grandfather was one of the greatest drivers to ever hit the track .
he's why i got into racing .
and i gotta believe it's hard wired into your dna .
your dad ought to get ray out of 56 and put you behind the wheel .
how many women drivers have won a nascar championship?
well ...
it only takes one person to blaze a trail .
ever think that you might be the next great peyton?
thanks for the props , but i gotta go .
you want to see how it feels behind the wheel of a real car?
are you serious?
i doubt your old man is gonna make you the same offer .
go on .
it'll be our little secret .
nice car ]
ok , bug .
let's see what makes you tick .
there's no way you could beat me with this engine .
ooh !
you want a piece of me? !
who's laughing now?
huh?
that was unbelievable !
she's a pretty sweet ride .
i've never driven anything like it .
that was my most awesome driving experience .
amazing what a real car can do , isn't it?
i got a little proposition .
why don't we raise the stakes .
my car for your car .
let's make tomorrow's race for pinks too .
huh?
i don't know .
i mean , herbie's really special .
come on .
nobody's gonna take you seriously in that thing .
now , if , uh , you drive home in trip murphy's stock car , your dad would be an idiot not to put you on the team .
what do you say?
for pinks?
all right .
you just better hope your boy maxx is on top of his game tomorrow .
ray , if you drank all the orange juice , i'll kill you .
mag wheels !
charisma !
why aren't you in france?
ugh !
paris was a drag .
i couldn't understand anybody .
and hello !
learn to pick up after our poodles .
i thought i'd come back to start our road trip early .
slight problem .
i promised i'd meet a friend in the desert .
why?
are you burying a body?
no , he's in a racing tournament .
you think you're clever , but i see through you .
you can?
it's obvious .
you're dating him .
ok , if you say so .
don't be coy .
what's his name?
ls it serious?
maxx .
you know , we're so close , it's like we're the same person .
what are you doing?
where have you been?
ln a nightmare where my dad , brother and best friend showed up .
well , you got a new problem .
herbie's freaking out .
i don't know what to do .
stop it !
did you leave him alone with trip?
hey , maggie !
who's that?
keep her away from my dad .
and she thinks i'm dating maxx .
just don't ask me to explain .
five minute warning .
get suited up .
and have a heart to heart with your car .
ok?
yeah .
sure .
where you been?
excuse me .
i'm kevin !
you must be charisma , yes?
good to meet you .
i just came back .
i had the worst time ...
herbie .
what's going on?
i don't have time for this now .
we need to beat trip .
just get a grip .
you're a car .
you do what i tell you to do , all right?
boo !
it's winner take all at the
trip murphy sudden death showdown .
maxx decimated his challengers yesterday , but now he's up against superstar trip murphy !
and now here comes maxx and herbie to the starting line .
blow his wheels off , maggie !
i mean , maxxie !
come on , herbie !
he's pulling ahead !
that's it , herbie .
come on !
i want that stock car !
what?
oh !
stupid car !
you blew this on purpose !
you were supposed to help me !
the voice is more high pitched than i might have imagined .
come on , maxx .
take off the helmet and show everybody who you really are .
it's a chick !
that ain't a chick !
that's maggie !
i guess i was wrong about you .
you're not the next great peyton after all .
you're just another amateur who choked in the clutch .
mags !
maggie .
hey .
hey , come on .
come on .
stop this .
you had a bad day .
that's it .
ok?
come on .
let's get out of here , take herbie back to the garage .
there's always another race .
there's not .
kevin , it's over .
i should have never done this in the first place .
that's ...
hey .
whoa .
get away from him !
hold it , buddy !
take it easy .
ok .
all right !
easy !
wait a minute .
maggie didn't tell you?

we were racing for pinks .
it was a little deal we made after i let her race my car .
she said it was the best ride of her life .
please tell me you didn't do that .
look , kevin , i'm sorry .
ok?
i'm sorry .
don't apologize to me .
apologize to herbie .
he's the one you stabbed in the back .
how could you lie to me?
i can explain .
your word used to mean something .
i thought i taught you honesty .
guess i was wrong .
dad , wait !
i'm through listening , maggie .
don't hurt him !
it's a car !
payback time , bug .
i can't believe you were pulling a racer x on everybody .
i thought this was a conversation free ride .
we've been friends for years .
i've never known the real you until today .
a lying backstabber who alienated everyone she cares about .
you don't get it .
you were awesome out there .
why go to new york?
you belong behind the wheel of a racecar .
grab the wheel !
what are you doing?
sorry .
look , i'm really excited about this new career .
are you going to be happy to report the story rather than being one yourself?
trip , we need to talk .
amateur hour's over .
i've got a real race to prepare for .
i want to buy herbie back .
herbie?
the volkswagen .

pile driver !

look , i don't care if you ever speak to me again , but you have to help herbie .
what happened?
i was a jerk .
i know .
me too .
you weren't a jerk .
no , i meant ...
i also know you were a jerk .
what are you gonna do about espn and new york and the big time?
i met someone who made me shift gears .
you know , get a new perspective .
we're down to the final few spots to see who gets into the big race .
we're down to the final few spots to see who gets into the big race .
one lap to go for ray peyton , jr . in the 56 car .
it's gonna be close .
let's see if ray peyton , jr . can qualify for sunday's nextel cup race .
come on , ray !
whoo !
yeah !
oh , my god .
peyton .
to the right .
he needs to be transferred .
ray , you ok?
i'm fine .
i keep telling everybody .
can we please get out of here?
i'm fine !
jeez !
i guess that means he's not totally fine .
no .
come here , ray .
come on .
ow !
doc , i'm fine .
look straight ahead .
i see it .
it's ...
now it's bright .
there's a problem with his left eye .
his depth perception is off .
we won't know the extent of the problem until we run tests .
bottom line , he can't race sunday .
dad , i'm sorry .
hey .
it's not your fault .
you ran great today .
i'm gonna go see the doctor .
wait a minute , dad .
i still qualified .
all we need is another driver and we got a shot .
let maggie race .
yeah , ray .
it's a good idea .
i mean , team peyton needs this race .
she's ready , sir .
she's really good .
no .
that's not gonna happen .
dad !
dad , i'm sorry i lied to you , ok?
but all i've ever wanted to do is race .
you're not getting behind the wheel .
because i'm a girl?
i've had one crash .
ray's had dozens !
it's different !
the only difference is your support !
what's really your problem with me racing?
because you're the spitting image of your mom .
and ...
i can't lose her twice .
dad , i may look like her on the outside ,
ok , but on the inside , i'm you .
i'm a peyton .
racing is in my blood .
please , let me race .
i can't .
i'm sorry .
i got it .
ok .
all right .
fine .
bye .
i have bad news .
i just got off the phone with my supplier .
they're not gonna give me parts until i pay my overdue bills ,
which you need money to do .
so you can't fix herbie?
i ...
shouldn't you be in bed?
mags , i'm not blind .
i just can't race .
but you can .
you're taking my space tomorrow .
well , wait .
what about dad?
dad always says i should be a team leader .
i called rest of the crew .
they agree .
you're the one .
look , we got a lot to do if we wanna get my car ready to race .
there's one car i'm gonna drive .
he's sitting over there .
you serious?
i race in herbie , or i don't race at all .
working for the weekend ]
i'm with trip murphy , nextel cup series champion .
the prevailing wisdom in the press box is that your only worry is you don't have enough shelf space for a fourth championship .
tell the boys thanks for the support .
but it's a tough track .
it's a 500 mile race .
there are some competent drivers out here .
jeff gordon's a decent driver .
there's an outside shot he could win .
i guess what i'm saying is , it's a ... ... long race and anything can happen in this sport .
we love you , trip !
i thought you told me you destroyed that car .
i'm sorry , dude .
hey , trip .
i know you're gonna win , but on the microscopic chance she beats you again ,
i've set up a slim fast " big loser " campaign .
so there's that .
he's mad at me .
he's mad at me .
hates me .
he hates us both .
never seen a bug with a spoiler .
don't touch .
soft top on a racecar .
i like that .
i like that .
this car just winked at me .
a racecar winked at you .
i swear .
the car winked at me .
are you feeling ok?
ls it the pressure?
i'm fine !
fine .
no problem .
i'm telling you , it just winked at me .
hey , kev .
hey .
could we get a second alone?
you and ...?
herbie .
of course .
hey , guys .
ray?
augie?
let's give the lady some space , huh?
sure .
thanks , guys .
you nervous?
it's good to be nervous .
keeps you alert .
i just want to say , in the spirit of honesty ,
i did total a car once when i was racing .
that was a long time ago .
hey , um ...
thanks for not giving up on me .
all right .
ready to do this thing?
cool .
let's show them what we got .
here we go , herbie .
this is it .
maggie peyton . ls that right?
that's what i've got too .
so it's maggie peyton in # 53 for team peyton in a last minute ruling by race officials .
what?
come on .
you've tried to think of a way to sell gear to women for years .
it says she calls the car herbie .
i've never heard of a vwbug racing nascar , but team peyton found a loophole .
go , maggie !
what are you doing?
you go , girl !
whoo !
go , maggie , go !
ladies and gentlemen , rise for our national anthem .
here we go .
go get 'em .
thanks .
ls this what you dreamed it'd be like?
yeah .
i mean , i wanted my dad here cheering me on , but ...
yeah .
there's something i want to say to you .
i guess i underestimated you guys .
good luck out there today .
thanks , trip .
word to the wise : it gets pretty nasty out there .
uh , trip , we got a race .
let's go !
let's go !
don't listen to him .
he's trying to get inside your head .
kev , let's go .
all right .
so , you wanted to tell me something .
yeah ...
i was gonna say , don't cut your turns too tight .
got it , chief .
ok .
let's go !
drivers , start your engines !
we've got the makings of a great race today .
beautiful weather and a great field of cars as they head out for their two pace laps .
we anticipate a record crowd .
fans have come to see which driver will hoist the nextel cup trophy .
great stories bookend this field .
trip murphy , star of the season , will lead the field to the green flag from pole position .
then there's maggie peyton , starting last .
we'll see if she has what it takes and if herbie has a good enough engine .
the pace car is off , the green flag is out , and we're underway here at california speedway !
those guys are fast !
looks like the 53 car got left in the dust .
there is a minimum speed .
she better get going or get a black flag .
come on , herbie .
we're not out of this yet .
come on , mags .
go !
rookie jitters or a mechanical problem , but maggie peyton's barely hanging on now .
ok .
let's go get dale !
herbie starts to gain ground .
here's peyton drafting up to dale jarrett in the 88 .
wait .
i don't think herbie's drafting .
i think he's literally attached to # 88 .
that little car's riding my bumper !
come on , dale , shake her off !
hang on !
come on , maggie .
here we go !
ready?
what a move !
maggie just did a slingshot on dale jarrett to move past # 88 .
yes !
go , mags !
unorthodox , but it put her back in the race .
i bet her granddad's smiling at that one .
we're back in it .
who's running first?
trip has junior by 2 lengths .
roll on down the highway ]
come on , mags !
best pit stop of the day for team peyton .
that keeps them in the hunt .
got a hungry pack chasing the leaders .
tony stewart , jeff gordon , mike bliss , all after the top spot .
maggie peyton and herbie come up on the outside .
eighteen laps to go in one of the most surprising races in nascar history .
trip murphy in # 82 is in front .
but can he hold the lead in the final laps?
here we come .
herbie , we gotta find an opening !
we'll make a move on turn three .
they're boxing us in .
three wide behind the leaders !
labonte low , peyton in the middle !
peyton takes a shot from gordon and one from labonte .
and now one from kasey kahne !
herbie's getting pounded in this pack !
i'm getting killed .
can't shake them !
yes , you can .
you can do this , sparkplug .
dad?
buckle down and grit your teeth .
come on , magpie .
you're the next great peyton .
time for everyone to know it .
thanks , dad .
look at that .
now what?
any suggestions?
gas it .
gas it right now !
huh?
there's running over competition , but never done like that !
yeah !
yah hah !
oh ho !
yeah !
uh oh .
we've got a new problem .
herbie's losing oil pressure ... fast !
looks like the 53's leaking oil on the track .
we're coming in .
kevin , it's sally .
what's going on with # 53?
did you drive here?
yeah .
why?
here comes the caution flag .
everyone to the pits .
team peyton may be out of the race with that oil leak .
that stunt you pulled almost cost us the race !
take care of the car and let me drive .
can i make two suggestions?
not now , larry !
not a perfect fit , but it'll have to hold !
how bad is it?
it might hold for 5 laps .
it might hold for one .
either way , avoid being slammed around out there !
listen .
you raced your heart out there today , herbie .
but if we keep going , that might be it for you .
forever .
sorry .
i'd rather lose this race than lose you .
whoa !
oh !
are you sure?
i can't believe it .
maggie peyton and herbie are getting back on the track !
for a car , you're not a good listener .
ok , herbie .
let's finish this .
where is she , crash?
the bug !
where's the bug?
focus on the win !
the fans are pulling for rookie driver maggie peyton , in a car she calls herbie .
attagirl .
nice move .
now go get 'em , maggie !
peyton on an incredible rally , passing them left and right .
now up to second place , behind trip murphy .
amazing !
come on .
did you miss us?
this girl's really beginning to tick me off .
2 laps to go in a two car race .
trip murphy and maggie peyton will settle this between them !
go , maggie !
all right !
we've got him now !
on the outside !
go high , herbie .
come on , herbie .
we're almost there .
door to door off the corner at the final ...
contact !
murphy slams into the side of peyton !
mags , don't push it .
mags , herbie can't take it .
forget the bug and win !
you're going down , bug !
trouble in turn four !
murphy into the wall and upside down !
ok , herbie , you ready?
keep it steady !
ahh !
no place to go !
look out for the crash !
herbie's ...
herbie's on the fence !
herbie's on the fence !
oh !
oh , god !
maggie peyton won !
maggie peyton has won !
incredible !
unbelievable !
i've never seen anything like this in nascar , not to mention the birth of the next great peyton !
we did it .
let's go !
whoo hoo !
whoo !
yes !
i'm so proud of you !
thanks , dad .
maggie , that was awesome !
thank you .
so great !
hey !
i thought your depth perception ...
oh , well , the best peyton was on the track today .
you did it .
congrats .
oh ...
look !
listen to me !
that car is possessed !
trip !
i saw it too .
it smiled at me !
that car is alive !
you gotta believe me .
it's mocking me !
i'm telling you !
that car is alive !
look !
it's doing it again !
you gotta believe me !
you gotta believe me !
this isn't the end , bug !
i'm going to get you , bug !
i'm going to get you !
he's fine .
he's fine .
just a little dehydrated .
wow .
gotta say , peyton , you and herbie make a great team .
we make a great team .
yeah , i thought we had good driver crew chief rapport there .
herbie , help me out here .
wha ...
all right , now , i'm gonna trust you guys this time , but you got a big race coming up .
have her home at a decent hour .
show some respect .
all right?
my house , my rules .
comprende?
ok , ray , i think they got it .
