jesus !
to the city of san francisco .
i will enjoy killing one person every day ... ... until you pay me one hundred thousand dollars .
if you agree , say so tomorrow morning ... ... at personal column , san francisco chronicle ... ... and i will set up meeting .
if i do not hear from you ... ... it'll be my next pleasure to kill a catholic priest or a ... .
scorpio .
what goes on in their minds?
kooks .
where the hell does he expect me to find a hundred thousand dollars?
you're not thinking of paying him , are you , mr. mayor?
the city of san francisco does not pay criminals not to commit crimes .
instead , we pay a police department .
chief , who's in charge of this case?
inspector callahan .
he's outside .
send inspector callahan in .
callahan?
mr. mayor , inspector callahan .
all right .
let's have it .
have what?
your report .
what have you been doing?
for the past 3/ 4 hour ... ... i've been sitting on my ass waiting on you .
damn it , harry .
it's the mayor you're talking to .
won't you sit down , inspector callahan?
there's a madman loose .
i've asked you what's being done .
fair enough?
we've got a dozen men checking identification files .
checking on all known extortionists , rooftop prowlers ... ... rifle nuts , peepers ...
mr. mayor?
we've arranged for rooftop surveillance and helicopters ... ... especially around the catholic churches and schools ... ... and in the black area .
ballistics is checking on the slug .
we're sure it's a 30 06 .
seven lands and grooves , right hand twist ...
we're running a computer check ... ... on everybody in the files whose birthday falls between ... ... october 23 and november 21 .
why?
natives of scorpio .
thank you , inspector .
have you mentioned this note to anyone?
how about you?
nobody .
your wife , sweetheart?
press?
nobody .
all right .
give the message to the chronicle .
we'll pay .
but we need time to get the money together .
wait a minute .
do i get this right?
you'll play this creep's game?
it'll give us breathing space .
it might get somebody killed .
let me meet with the son of a bitch !
nope , none of that .
we would end up with a real bloodbath .
i agree with the chief .
we'll do it this way .
thank you , mr. mayor .
come on , callahan , let's go .
i don't want trouble , like you had last year in the fillmore district .
that's my policy .
when an adult male is chasing a female ... ... with intent to commit rape , i shoot the bastard .
that's my policy .
intent?
how did you establish that?
when a naked man chases a woman in an alley with a knife and a hard on ... ... i figure he isn't out collecting for the red cross .
i think he's got a point .
inspector callahan .
jaffe .
usual .
usual lunch , or usual dinner?
what difference does it make?
not much .
hey , jaffe ... ... is that tan ford still in front of the bank?
tan ford?
yeah , tan ford .
engine running?
i don't know .
how can i tell?
exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe .
that's awful !
look at that pollution .
do me a favor , will you?
call this telephone number .
police department?
tell them inspector callahan thinks there's a ... ... two eleven in progress at the bank .
got it?
got it .
be sure and tell them it's in progress , right?
in progress .
yes , sir .
now , if they'll just wait till the cavalry arrives .
shit !
halt !
i know what you're thinking .
did he fire six shots or only five?
to tell the truth , in all the excitement i've kind of lost track myself .
do i feel lucky?
well , do you , punk?
i got to know .
son of a bitch !
it looks like we can save that leg .
i've got a couple under my knee .
ever consider another line of work?
i really appreciate this , steve .
we potrero hill boys have to stick together .
nothing fancy , now .
just a little tweezers and mercurochrome .
do i tell you how to beat a confession out of a prisoner?
i haven't got all night .
you might experience discomfort .
but if you do , just have your wife fix a ... .
sorry , harry .
what will you do with those?
cut your pants off .
no .
we'll pull them off .
it'll hurt .
for $29 . 50 , let it hurt .
you can turn your back if you're embarrassed .
good morning , inspector .
maria .
you wanted to see me , lieutenant?
when the hell you going to get a haircut?
whenever you do .
who's got time?
i was up till 3 a . m . checking the search patterns .
put in for overtime .
that'll be the day .
you made a good pinch .
chief was pleased .
he was?
well done !
i can't tell you how moved i am .
i pass along a compliment ... ... you could be a little polite .
it might not kill you to say thanks .
i'd rather say thanks to a raise .
harry , check communications .
something from chicago .
a gun nut .
i'll get right on it .
now wait a minute !
i'm putting somebody with you .
what are you talking about?
you need a partner .
what's wrong with the one i've got?
he's in the hospital !
he'll be out in a few weeks .
say hello to chico gonzales .
he'll be working with you .
you must be kidding .
i have no time to break in newcomers .
why don't you do this boy a favor?
what do you mean?
you know what happens to guys i worked with .
deitzick's in the hospital ... ... and fanduchi's dead .
so?
if i need a partner , i'll get me one who knows what he's doing .
what about de georgio?
no way !
you work with gonzales or you don't work .
straight from the fifth floor .
got it?
i got it .
if you see de georgio , send him in here !
you from around here?
yeah , but i went to san jose state .
play ball?
no , i boxed .
light heavyweight .
just what i need is a college boy .
found anything you like about me yet?
it's early yet .
get your degree?
sociology .
sociology !
you'll go far , if you live .
i intend to .
inspector callahan .
don't let your degree get you killed .
i'm liable to get killed with you .
i'll remember that .
hero !
nice work yesterday .
fatso !
bressler wants to see you .
you're a sweet man , harry .
there is one question , inspector callahan .
why do they call you dirty harry?
that's one thing about our harry .
doesn't play favorites .
harry hates everybody : limeys , micks , hebes , dagos , niggers , honkies , chinks .
you name it .
how does he feel about mexicans?
ask him !
especially spics .
hey !
there's a guy on the roof over there !
on stockton street by washington square .
you , on the roof !
you , there !
yes , you .
stop what you're doing .
turn around and put your hands in the air .
i don 't know how the helicopter boys lost him !
how could they let him get out without seeing him?
they were probably talking instead of looking , like they were supposed to .
that's possible .
attention , all units .
turn that thing up louder .
prowler last seen in the vicinity of washington square .
he is an adult male .
caucasian .
repeat , adult male caucasian .
when last seen , he was wearing tan chinos ... ... pale blue shirt , brown coat or sweater , dark gloves .
he had a tan suitcase ... ... which probably contains a 30 06 rifle .
he's wanted ...
those loonies !
they ought to throw a net over the whole bunch !
i know what you mean .
there !
what?
tan suitcase .
where?
i lost him .
there he goes , over there .
does that bag look tan?
i don't know , i haven't even seen him yet .
go to filber and hang a left .
look out for these people !
fruitcake !
get out of the way , hammerhead !
it was a tan suitcase .
i know it was .
i saw him .
there he is .
i see him .
car 2 , the license number ... ... at 10 32 on that chevrolet , colorado plates .
how do you want to work this?
find another entrance .
i'll go in here .
car 2 , what's the model of that chevrolet?
car 2 .
it's an impala convertible .
10 4 .
you can cancel that 10 25 .
three cars here .
anybody home?
i brought you a nice present .
let me see it .
it's beautiful !
why don't you go get a nice container of egg rolls?
you getting an eyeful?
you goddamn pie hawker !
we should call the police .
i am a police ...
up against the wall .
right now !
move .
let them go .
let them go?
you heard me .
they assaulted a police officer .
a police officer !
he was standing on a can peeking in ... ... on hot mary and her boyfriend !
beat it .
get out of here .
how about the man with the suitcase?
wrong number .
i just had another thought .
yeah?
about what?
about why they call you dirty harry .
inspector 71 .
inspector 71 .
please respond to your call .
inspector 71 .
do you read me?
this is inspector 71 .
i've got an 8 0 4 in progress .
california hall at polk and turk streets .
10 4 .
we're on our way .
it's some idiot .
where?
i don't see him .
there he is .
yeah .
now i see him .
i have a 10 29 and a 10 28 .
in 600 block of baker .
on a chevrolet .
california license d dog , c charles , v victor 4 7 2 .
we thought it was your sniper , but it turned out to be a suicide attempt .
anybody try to talk him down?
yeah , no luck .
but now you're here ... .
you mean , i go up .
we'd sure appreciate it .
don't you try to get me !
not me .
you're the one who wants to get yourself killed .
not me .
always happens with you guys .
the last minute you want to ... ... grab onto somebody , take somebody with you .
down you go .
not me !
won't you try to grab me?
a friend of mine was up about 20 floors with a jumper a few years ago .
the jumper grabbed him and they went off .
mashed all over .
couldn't tell which legs was with which , which arms with which ... .
it was a terrible mess .
i tell you , i almost threw up myself .
i'd just like your name and address .
why?
it's such a mess down there afterwards !
it makes identification impossible .
even if they find your driver's license !
all that blood !
i think i'm going to puke !
don't do that , son .
all those people down there looking up .
the fire chief looking up .
with his face ... .
you bastard !
get the stretcher up here .
now you know why i'm called dirty harry .
every dirty job that comes along .
inspector 71 .
this is inspector 71 .
got something for you .
corner of sierra and texas .
a young boy , negro .
what about him?
shot in the face .
blew part of it away .
anybody know who the boy is?
his name was charlie russell .
i'm his mother .
he's only 10 years old .
inspector , this officer ...
oh , jesus christ !
you'd better go check on the mother .
what do you have?
that 30 06 shell casing .
he was up here all right .
welcome to homicide .
the man who designed blue serge uniforms for police departments ... ... has to sell these for a living !
. 458 magnum?
this thing will stop an elephant .
yeah .
apparently you like a little edge .
all i can get , sir .
he's no elephant , harry .
he's no animal of any kind .
what have you got , lieutenant?
the blue flags represent the units that are going to be on duty by dark tonight .
double shifts and overtime .
at nighttime .
daylight , the helicopters will keep him off the roofs .
we're going for high visibility .
units will make themselves very noticeable .
except here .
right .
the north beach area .
we're saving that for him .
have you found a good stakeout?
i think so .
it's a building that overlooks the roof where they spotted him yesterday .
something bothering you?
nothing .
speak up .
you're among friends here .
it seems a long shot that he'd come back to the same roof .
there are a lot of rooftops in san francisco .
most of them are locked .
this particular one'll be open for him .
these sick guys have behavior patterns .
we know they'll rob the very same store 3 , 4 times in a row .
must appeal to their superego or something .
scorpio strikes again .
they like that feeling .
there's one other reason why he might pick the same rooftop .
he's got a clear view of the st. peter and paul's church .
and they're having a novena tonight .
go on .
the note .
he threatened to kill a priest or a negro .
the russell boy was black .
he may just figure he owes himself a padre .
inspector 71 .
we're in position to start our surveillance .
how about the priest?
he knows he's being set up for bait?
yeah , he wanted to .
we told him we had a volunteer willing to take his place .
who?
never guess .
yeah , i know .
welcome to homicide .
you owe it to yourself to live a little , harry .
son of a bitch took the bait !
when i say " now , " hit him with the light .
now !
you all right?
i think so .
call an ambulance .
collins never knew what hit him .
let's go .
clear the alley .
there's nothing to see .
call headquarters .
he's loose in north beach .
it's a whole new ball game , fellows .
he grabbed a 14 year old girl .
ann mary deacon .
the bomb squad got a call .
suspicious object in golden gate park .
it was addressed to the mayor .
the lab sent it to us , with this letter inside .
ann mary deacon , buried alive .
the poor kid went to the movies last night and never came home .
double crossing san francisco police made me do this .
now ransom $200, 000 , in used tens and twenties .
one man with yellow bag .
south side marina .
green east harbor .
9 p . m .
she has oxygen till 3 a . m . tomorrow .
red panties and bra .
nice tits .
mole on left thigh .
anything cute and you'll force me to let girl die ... ... of slow suffocation .
signed , scorpio .
anything else?
the mother identified the bra ... ... the hank of hair ... ... and that .
the dentist identified that .
said it was pulled out with a pair of pliers .
you know she's dead .
all i know is the letter says she'll be alive until 3 a . m .
the mayor's out trying to put the money together now .
he's using up a lot of favors .
he wants to pay .
no tricks .
we need a bag man .
you want the job?
you got it .
be in the chief's office at 6 p . m .
all right .
wait a minute .
what about me?
you're out .
no cover?
not even one man?
sure that's how to do it?
i'm not sure !
but those are my orders .
all right?
no wonder they call him dirty harry .
he gets the shit end of the stick .
one more word and you're chopped off at the ankles .
al , let's split the difference .
give him the night off .
get the hell out of here , both of you .
testing 1 , 2 , 3 ...
what are you yelling for?
all you have to do is whisper .
mary had a little lamb , its fleece as white as snow .
okay , that's better .
it's good for 2 or 3 blocks .
but in a tunnel ... ... forget it .
all right , sid .
what do i owe you?
bring it back in one piece .
$200, 000 .
count it and sign for it .
did you count it out?
did you count it , chief?
it's not my responsibility .
always knew i'd get rich on the police force .
just make sure nobody takes it away from you .
god knows how he'll contact you .
he'll probably run you all over town .
go where you're told .
do what you're told .
play it straight down the line .
okay?
nothing cute .
nothing fancy .
just pay the ransom money and report back here .
would you mind if i borrowed a little scotch tape?
it's disgusting that a police officer should know how to use that weapon .
you got a yellow suitcase?
yeah , i got it right with me .
what's your name?
callahan .
what are you?
police officer .
hello?
all right , police officer ... ... this is how we play .
i bounce you all over town to make sure you're alone .
if i even think you're being followed , the girl dies .
if you talk to anyone , even if it's a pekinese pissing on a lamppost ... ... the girl dies .
is the girl okay?
just shut up and listen .
no car .
i give you some time to go from phone booth to phone booth .
i ring 4 times .
you don 't answer by the fourth ring ... ... that's the end of the game .
the girl dies .
what time you got?
9 : 30 .
now listen ...
you listen .
i'm watching you .
not all the time , but you'll never know when or where .
now get to forest hills station as fast as you can .
understand?
yeah .
i hope you're not stupid .
downstairs .
take the " k " car .
get off at church and 20th .
hurry up , or you'll blow it .
you sound like you had a good rest .
you'll need it .
i'm going to give you a nice little run this time .
you better make it , because if you don 't , dead girl !
public phone , hamburger stand , aquatic park .
hubba hubba hubba , pig bastard .
what's in the bag , man?
you dudes get lost now , you hear?
screw the bag !
just give us the wallet .
you don't listen , do you , asshole?
don't answer that !
who picked it up?
some old guy .
never saw him before .
chico , he hung up .
you know mt .
davidson park?
yeah .
go to the cross .
i'm at the entrance on lansdale street .
i'm going up .
i see a couple of people .
just a couple of kids necking .
boys or girls?
i'm callahan .
my friends call me alice .
and i will take a dare .
when was the last time you were busted?
if you're a vice , i'll kill myself .
well , do it at home .
freeze !
just like a statue .
that's right .
one wrong move , anything , i don't care .
i'll kill you and the girl both .
understand?
yeah .
drop the bag .
left hand .
let's see the gun .
my !
that's a big one .
left hand .
throw it .
easy .
raise your hands .
come on , get them up .
now turn .
face the cross .
come on .
put your nose right up against the cement .
you lift that hand once more and i won't let you know where the girl is !
do we understand each other?
do we understand each other?
don't pass out on me yet !
no , no .
no , no .
not yet .
not yet !
don't pass out on me yet , you rotten oinker !
do we understand each other?
if you care what happens to the girl , you'd better answer me !
all right?
listen to me carefully .
i've changed my mind .
i'm going to let her die .
i just wanted you to know that .
you understand?
i ijust wanted to make sure you knew that before i killed you .
goodbye , callahan !
chico , don't kill him !
the hospital report on gonzales looks okay , chief .
yeah .
well , he's a pretty tough kid .
he's right here .
he's got two cracked ribs .
they want to do some more tests on him in the morning .
the son of a bitch really kicked him a couple of beauts .
i'm sending him home .
right , chief .
he says beat it !
that's an order .
the chief wants to know if i misunderstood his orders .
meaning , am i just plain stupid or did i deliberately disobey him?
he wants to know what gonzales was doing there .
he wants to know why we screwed everything up .
what am i going to tell him?
why don't you start by telling him the truth?
tell him gonzales was obeying orders from a superior .
me .
tell him you didn't know anything about it .
when this is over , if he wants my badge , he can have that too .
you wouldn't have a belt of booze around here , would you?
lieutenant bressler's office .
put him on .
what is it?
it's park emergency .
they just treated a guy who had a knife wound in the leg .
yeah , doctor?
what'd this guy look like?
long blond hair ... ... medium build , about 150 pounds .
pale complexion .
he didn't give you his name , doc?
nope .
they usually give a phony name .
but i've seen him someplace .
it's important you remember .
there's a 14 year old girl who's suffocating .
i'm trying to think !
it was ... .
i believe he works around here .
doctor , could you give him something?
he's in pain !
yes , just a moment .
she'll be dead in an hour !
i'm trying to remember !
i've got who he is .
when they had football , he used to sell programs at the stadium .
i think the groundskeeper lets him live there .
live where?
there .
kezar stadium .
illegal entry .
no warrant .
looks like we climb .
too much linguine .
i'll find another way .
stop !
don't do anything more !
you tried to kill me !
you need any help?
go on and get some air , fatso .
please !
no more !
can't you see i'm hurt?
you shot me !
please , don't !
let me have a doctor !
please , get me the doctor !
don't kill me !
the girl , where is she?
you tried to kill me !
if i did , your head would be splattered all over this field .
where's the girl?
i want a lawyer .
i said , where's the girl?
i have the right for one .
where's the girl?
i have the right to a lawyer !
don't !
please !
i have rights .
i want a lawyer !
harry callahan .
he said it was urgent .
yes , the district attorney has been wanting to talk to you .
it's inspector callahan .
have him come in , please .
won't you come this way?
may i bring you in a cup of coffee?
no , thanks .
i'll be done in a minute .
have a seat .
i've just been looking over your arrest report .
a very unusual piece of police work .
really amazing .
i had some luck .
you're lucky i'm not indicting you for assault with intent to commit murder !
where does it say you've got a right to kick down doors , torture suspects?
deny medical attention and legal counsel?
where have you been?
does escobedo ring a bell?
miranda?
you must have heard of the 4th amendment !
what i'm saying is , that man had rights .
i'm all broken up about that man's rights .
you should be .
i've got news for you .
when he's well enough to leave the hospital , he walks .
what are you talking about?
he's free !
you're letting him go?
we have to .
we can't try him .
and why is that?
because i'm not wasting 1 / 2 million tax dollars ... ... on a trial we can't possibly win .
the problem is , we don't have any evidence .
what do you call that?
i call it nothing .
zero .
you're saying that ballistics can't match the bullet up to this rifle?
it does not matter what ballistics can do !
this rifle might make a nice souvenir .
but it's inadmissible as evidence !
who says?
it's the law .
then the law is crazy !
this is judge bannerman of the appellate court .
he also holds classes in constitutional law .
i've asked him for an opinion .
your honor?
in my opinion , the search of the suspect's quarters was illegal .
evidence obtained thereby , such as that hunting rifle for instance ... ... is inadmissible in court .
you should have gotten a search warrant .
i'm sorry .
it's that simple .
search warrant?
a girl was dying !
she was , in fact , dead according to the medical report !
but i didn't know that !
the court would recognize the officer's legitimate concern for the girl ... ... but there is no way they can possibly condone police torture .
all evidence concerning the girl , the suspect's confession ... ... physical evidence ... ... would have to be excluded .
there must be something you can get him on !
without the evidence of the gun and the girl?
i couldn't convict him of spitting on the sidewalk !
now , the suspect's rights ... ... were violated ... ... under the 4th and 5th ... ... and probably the 6th and 14th amendments .
and ann mary deacon , what about her rights?
she's raped and left in a hole to die !
who speaks for her?
the district attorney's office !
if you'll let us .
i have a wife and 3 kids .
i don't want him on the streets any more than you do .
he won't be out there long .
what is that supposed to mean?
sooner or later he will stub his toe and i'll be there .
this office won't stand for any harassment !
you're crazy if you think you've heard the last of him .
he will kill again .
how do you know?
because he likes it .
you sure you weren't tailed?
yeah .
you really want $200 worth .
every penny of it .
might as well be comfortable .
go on , sit .
relax .
take it easy .
it's going to be all right .
you sure you want the rest of it?
every penny's worth !
you black son of a bitch !
this one's on the house .
that's got to be him .
are you claiming that the san francisco police did this to you?
i swear it .
as god is my judge .
why are they harassing you?
they tried to frame me with the murder .
and now they're trying to murder me .
and look at me !
i'm supposed to be innocent until proven guilty and look at what they did to me .
everywhere i go cops follow me .
and just look at me !
just a minute , nurse .
let me ask him one more question .
did you see who did this to you?
can you identify him?
his name is callahan .
he's a big cop .
works homicide .
callahan .
now , that's the rerun from the 4 o'clock news .
since then he's given a statement to the chronicle .
he claims you've been following him .
and beat him up .
what about it , harry?
you want my star?
i want an answer .
have you been following him?
yeah , i've been following him on my own time .
anybody can tell i didn't do that .
how?
because he looks too damn good , that's how !
before i let you go , let's get one thing straight .
i don't want any more surveillance !
neither does he .
what does that mean?
good night , sir .
go ahead .
try them .
guy makes them where i always eat .
thank you .
i talked to bressler about being on with me .
so you know you got a spot when you get out .
i don't know if i am coming back , harry .
doing a lot of thinking about it and ... .
i have a teaching credential .
and i figure ... ... what for?
you know?
time for therapy .
you hang in there now .
see you tomorrow .
same time?
it's my fault , you know .
what?
his leaving .
i thought i could take it .
no class .
don't ever say that .
what?
don't ever low rate yourself .
what i meant was , whatever it takes to be a cop's wife ... ... i'm just not sure i'm making it .
he really tries , and all these bastards ... ... " pig " this and " pig " that .
but maybe it's when i watch him walk out that door at night .
and i think ... ... what if it's the last time i see him?
am i the only one?
doesn't it drive your wife crazy?
no .
you mean she got used to it?
no , she never did , really .
what , then?
she's dead .
please , forgive me .
she was driving home and a drunk crossed the center line .
no reason for it , really .
i'm so sorry .
that's okay .
