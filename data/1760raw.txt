you're okay?
yeah .
i lost my earring .
what does it look like?
it's a pearl one .
it should turn up .
i'm fond of them , 'cause my husband gave them to me .
you should go .
yeah .
i ... really enjoyed that .
yes , i know .
leon ...
leon ... this is about sex .
it's about a man and a woman joined groin to groin .
get it?
come on .
no .
like this .
mom?
i'm in here .
i don't have any clothes .
you looked on your bedroom floor?
yeah .
i mean clean ones .
when i come home , i'll clean them , okay?
why are you jogging , dad?
i want to get fit .
what for?
i don't want to die .
you are gonna die .
not just yet .
mom?
clothes?
then stop jogging .
mom , clothes?
what am i gonna wear?
see you , mom
see you , dad .
see you , mate .
see you , dad .
hey , hey , what about me?
i'm 16 now .
you're telling me you're a man now?
no , but ...
have a good day , dad .
yeah .
you too .
is there some point where a son stops kissing his father?
apparently .
police !
get out !
you weren't a bit hard?
the guy deals drugs .
he's scum .
yeah , but he wasn't going anywhere .
what did you expect me to do?
are you seeing anyone?
not with the hours i keep .
what about somebody on the force?
male cops are lousy in bed .
there is someone .
he eats in the same restaurant as i do .
have you spoken to him yet?
we've exchanged glances .
oooh ...
it's a start .
how's sonja?
she's good .
haven't seen her around for a while .
yeah , well ... she's busy , with the boys and work ...
tell her i said hi .
i will .
have you told him you're not happy?
i would have thought that he wouldn't need to be told .
that depends on how good an actor you are .
well ...
i guess i must be pretty good .
how do you want your marriage to be?
passionate ...
and challenging , and ... and ... honest ...
isn't it honest?
not emotionally .
not emotionally it isn't .
it just feels ...
like we're ...
like we're just ... going through the motions , you know?
and i want more .
i want more than that .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome dr. valerie somers .
thank you .
we don't know what to feel anymore .
we don't know what's right or wrong anymore .
the confused cry of the modern age ...
we ask , " what can we believe in?
what should we believe in?
our politicians?
hardly .
our priests?
you'd be amazed at how many clients come to see me because they once believed in a priest .
it's not supposed to be that way .
but it is .
what then?
our parents?
home is a sanctuary .
for the privileged few .
for most , it's a battleground .
it's not meant to be like that .
but it is .
love?
can we believe in love?
feel safe in it?
loving someone means we have to relinquish power .
it's mutual surrender .
but how can this take place?
trust .
trust is as vital to human relationships as breath is to life ... and just as elusive .
two years ago , my 11 year old daughter was murdered .
her name was eleanor .
this wasn't supposed to happen .
but it did .
it seemed to go well .
i was worried you weren't going to be there .
i said i would be .
do you want a whiskey?
i've got an early client .
why don't we take separate cars in the morning?
i've got a late meeting .
that way , you wouldn't have to wait for me .
i've got plenty of work i can do .
you can pick me up after your meeting .
sure .
okay .
i met someone .
we went home and had sex .
as you do ... well , some of us do .
and he asked to see me again .
i wasn't expecting that .
and?
against my better judgement , i said yes .
we've been seeing each other for awhile .
and you like him?
yes , i do .
very much .
so?
he comes encumbered ... with a wife .
is he gay?
when he's with me , he seems to be .
does she know about you?
i assume so .
she would sense it , wouldn't she?
it depends on how good he is at deceiving her .
or how good she is at deceiving herself .
v. " don't forget " v.
hi , nik .
having a party , jane?
yeah .
did you want to join me?
take this inside for mommy .
well?
yeah .
where?
in a motel .
oh ...
did you get his number?
is that what you do?
i don't know .
if you like the guy .
but he's married .
well , what?
he's not happy .
he can't be , if he's ... messing around .
you want to see him again?
do you think i should?
you want me to be honest?
no .
no .
when are you gonna take that thing off?
it's too tight .
i've got to get it cut off .
nik caught up with pete the other day .
he wants to come back .
i don't love him , paula .
go up to the guy , and ask if you can join him .
what have you got to lose?
just a little dignity .
it is not the issue here .
he eats alone in a restaurant .
so do i.
exactly .
oh , hey .
hi .
uh ...
jane , this is claudia .
claudia , jane .
hi .
hi .
jane's in the same dance class as sonja and i.
i'll get going .
say hi to sonja .
sorry .
is that really awkward?
no , it's fine .
how are you?
i'm good .
yeah .
good .
i'd better go .
jane .
mmmm .
where did you find it?
paula?
mmm .
there's an unmarked police car in front of jane's place .
she's seeing a cop now?
don't be nosy , nik .
what?
are her and pete getting back together or what?
i don't know .
what if they are?
what do i say then?
nothing .
well , he's ... he's a mate of mine .
then do him a favor and stay out of it .
the baby's sick?
yeah .
shit .
oh fuck ...
don't stop .
here .
leon?
oh fuck .
you're all right?
what is it?
what is it?
it's nothing .
should i call ...
no , no .
just ...
should i get a doctor?
i get this pain in my chest sometimes .
you should have told me you have a weak heart .
i don't .
i don't want to have an affair with ...
i don't have a weak heart , all right?
this is not an affair , it's a one night stand that happened twice .
oh shit .
sorry .
i didn't mean that .
do you worry that we don't make love very often?
no .
i don't really think about it that much .
why not?
i love you .
whether we make love three times a week or once a month does not really change that .
doesn't it?
is this a test?
no .
it's just ...
i want to know what you're thinking .
why do women always want to know that?
you're up late .
yeah , i'm trying to finish this .
you want one?
i've got one .
what's wrong?
nothing .
just had a shit of a day .
stopped off and had a drink with claudia .
yeah , i know .
i phoned her .
i didn't know if you were working late .
all right .
fuck !
fuck !
you fucking stupid bastard !
what the fuck is wrong with you?
would you fucking look where you're going? !
fucking idiot !
fuck !
oh fuck .
hey !
wait .
are you all right?
sorry .
here's your bag .
jesus .
what happened?
i fell .
are you all right?
it's nothing .
let me look .
i'll be all right .
i said i'm all right !
i keep thinking about her .
are you feeling guilty?
do you think i should be?
it doesn't matter what i think .
he feels manipulated by her .
how?
she's very needy .
are you trying to justify his deceit?
no , i'm trying to understand it .
it's complex .
mmm hm .
but isn't it still an act of deceit?
no marriage can be based on that .
most marriages are based on that .
you think you know what goes on in most marriages?
what?
because i'm gay , i can't have an opinion ...?
it's not what i was ...
she's not the victim in this .
she chose to marry him .
not knowing he was gay .
there's knowing , and there's " knowing .
what do you mean?
i think some women like to live the lie .
it's easier than dealing with the truth .
maybe she loves him .
but so do i.
then he has to make a choice .
unless one of us withdraws from the contest .
is love a contest for you , patrick?
patrick?
yes .
sometimes .
what happened to your head?
i bumped it on a clothes line .
listen ... thanks for last night .
i'll lie for you to anyone , except sonja .
i don't want to lie to her again .
fair enough .
why are you trying so hard to fuck up your life?
you don't know how lucky you are to have the marriage you've got .
and you're pissing all over it .
it's great your husband comes with you .
yeah .
what about yours?
i'm separated .
ah ...
can you tell?
no .
no , you just have this ...
kind of look .
what?
desperate?
no .
full of potential .
sorry i'm late .
jane , this is my husband leon .
hi .
yeah ...
excuse me , everybody .
there is a salsa band playing tonight and tomorrow at the latin .
leon .
sonja .
are you guys coming?
i thought we'd have a nice dinner together .
come on .
you can go out to eat anytime .
i'd like to go .
i'm kind of tired .
okay .
i'll see you at home .
bye .
what was that about?
hey , she needed a partner .
and you happened to volunteer?
she chose me .
i'd never say anything , leon .
pete !
g'day , nik .
how are you , mate?
drove by to see jane .
doesn't look like she's in .
did you see her tonight?
no .
you don't know where she is then?
no , sorry .
how is she?
the last time i saw her , okay .
that's good .
how are you going?
good .
good .
it's late .
i thought she'd be home .
sorry , i haven't seen her .
if there was something i should know , you'd tell me?
'cause ... if she's seeing someone , i'd want to know .
it'd be easier .
of course .
i hate this .
thanks , man .
see you later .
take care .
so why did you and your husband split up?
i don't know .
i just turned around one day and i realized i was living with a man i didn't love anymore .
it was that simple?
no .
but you knew that much .
maybe my expectations were too high .
you're a brave woman .
you are .
most people settle for less .
i really like you , leon .
maybe a little too much .
but i'm ...
i'm starting to wonder just ...
where this might go .
i'm still in love with my wife , jane .
right .
i'm sorry .
so ...
i'm wondering why ... why have you been seeing me if you're still in love with your wife?
i don't know .
it's not something that i planned .
look , jane , i ...
this doesn't have to end badly .
just go .
just go .
go .
it's twofold actually .
he thinks he runs the faculty , but he hasn't published anything decent since 1985 .
you seem preoccupied .
i'm having trouble with a client .
i'm not handling him very well .
refer him on .
i find him a little threatening .
why?
i don't like ... what he's doing .
you're judging him .
darling , you have to refer him on .
i'll see you outside .
excuse me .
i hate what's happening to us .
i hate it .
we don't talk anymore .
we lost our daughter .
that could have brought us closer .
do you think about her very much?
of course i do .
i just don't need to write a book about it .
do you think i did the wrong thing?
i just wanted the whole ... world to know .
look at me , john .
look at me .
come on , kids .
we're late for school .
watch the road .
come on .
in you get .
bye , derek .
hi .
hi .
are you okay?
yeah .
i'll pop around after work .
okay .
hey , nik .
you want coffee?
yeah , sure .
pete was over last night .
how is he?
not good .
how's the job hunting going?
are you guys all right for money?
yeah .
yeah?
'cause if you need some money , i'll be more than happy to ...
no .
i know paula wouldn't take it .
she's doing extra shifts now .
you sure there's no bill you want to clear?
it's fine .
the offer's there .
thanks .
it's all right .
why didn't you wake me up?
i thought you could do with the rest .
i'll go have my shower .
actually , i've got an early start .
i'll only be 10 minutes .
just take your own car .
come on , wait for me , please .
jesus .
sorry .
i have a lecture tonight anyway .
so , you'll be home late?
yeah .
bye .
i think he's having an affair .
he's distant , preoccupied ,
like he's holding something back from me .
what would you do if he was?
i ...
i think i'd leave .
yeah .
and does that scare you?
yeah .
i'm ...
i'm middle aged .
i don't know what it's like out there .
you know?
and i have these two ...
beautiful boys .
but i ...
i would survive if i had to .
i like being this age .
and i ...
i like the lines around my eyes .
i don't know if he does , but ...
i do .
it's not that he might have slept with another woman , you know?
it's that he might not tell me .
that would be the betrayal .
do you still love him?
valerie?
patrick phelan is here .
give me a minute , okay?
you don't like me , do you?
is it important to you?
would it make a difference if i were straight?
i don't have a problem with your sexuality .
but it is a problem that i'm having an affair with a married man .
you must stop trying to make me the subject .
it's just another form of defense .
i'm curious about your role in this triangle .
my role?
i'm a respite from a marriage that's gotten too hard .
how?
he takes refuge in me .
in what i offer him .
what do you offer him?
sex unencumbered by need .
why doesn't he leave her?
good men don't know how to leave their wives .
good men or cowardly men?
he told me that making love to her was like trying to fill an empty well .
what did you say?
what?
you said something to me .
no , i didn't .
yes , you did !
i didn't say anything .
you heard him , didn't you?
this is bullshit ...
bullshit?
yeah .
i want your name .
give me your name !
i want your name !
a bourbon , please .
a double bourbon with ice .
thanks .
you all right?
yeah .
you sure?
you don't look all right .
what?
are you a cop?
yeah .
really?
really .
sorry , i just ... something weird really happened .
i was walking and this woman started yelling at me .
she thought i said something to her .
what for?
i don't know .
i was walking down the street and she went nuts .
did you?
no .
i didn't do anything .
i don't do stuff like that .
take it easy .
i believe you .
sorry .
it was just really weird and ... now you're a cop , so that's really weird .
sorry .
you want another drink?
yeah .
thanks .
same again .
sharon said there's a booze bus on the freeway .
i'll take the backroad home .
hannah !
yeah?
grab dad's wallet from the kitchen .
yeah .
hey .
she asked me for coffee this morning .
who?
jane .
what for?
i don't know .
i can't find it !
it's near the fridge .
i don't know .
she's trying to come on to me .
what?
she's lonely , nik .
and you're bored .
that's a lethal combination .
stay away from her .
what's the matter?
you're a bit jealous , huh?
huh?
you ever fuck with our marriage , and i cut your balls off .
i'll hang them on the lawn , between your socks and your jocks .
got it?
sure , babe .
wake me up when you get home .
huh?
i'm running down this hill , and i go around this corner .
and suddenly , there's this guy , and bam !
right into him .
right away , i'm going after him ...
you fucking prick !
look where you're going .
but it was your fault .
well , yeah .
i don't know why i went at him .
it was just ... my buttons got pushed or something .
anyway , so i look down , and there he is , on the ground , cowering .
huh?
he's got blood on his face ...
and he broke his fucking nose .
oh no .
and he gets up and he starts to role play .
and that's when it happens .
what?
he starts to cry .
what for?
i don't know .
what makes a man cry like that?
yeah , a lot of things .
so what did you do?
i just held him .
i just stood there and i held him .
but the whole time i was thinking ,
you fucking weak prick , pull yourself together .
don't you want to cry sometimes?
yeah , but ...
you don't , do you?
mmm .
hey .
we ordered your food , but we ate it .
what's that smell?
where's your mom?
dancing .
where's your brother?
upstairs .
shit .
sam !
sam?
sam !
sam !
what the fuck is going on?
for christ's sake , i'm a cop !
all right , you get the good stuff .
don't you smart mouth me .
what's going on?
your brother is being an idiot .
so what's new?
did you know about this?
have you tried it?
if you ever give your brother that shit ...
as if i'd give ...
shut up !
no ...
shut up !
give your brother this stuff , i'll give you a thumping you won't forget .
i don't care how big you get !
give me the rest .
that's it .
get downstairs .
you're grounded , mate .
what?
oh shit .
oh god .
you're a very beautiful woman , sonja .
i'd like to fuck with you .
can i have a whiskey , dry please?
excuse me .
hello .
you look like you're enjoying yourself .
yeah , i am .
it's good you're having fun , while our son's at home smoking pot .
i know .
i told him if he's gonna do it , he should do it at home
so we can control it .
why didn't you tell me?
because you haven't been around much lately .
i'm not having drugs in the house .
what are you gonna do?
banning it won't solve the problem .
what are you doing here?
what?
what are you doing here?
most of the guys here aren't much older than our son .
i thought we'd go back to your place .
we can't .
my mother .
wait .
slow down .
stop .
get off .
jesus !
what's wrong?
i'm sorry .
this was a bad idea .
sorry .
fucking uptight bitch !
hello?
you found john and valerie .
leave a message after the tone .
hi , it's me .
are you there?
okay , i've had an accident .
i'm okay .
i can't get the car started .
i'm on the backroad and ...
i just wanted to get home .
i'll try your mobile .
bye .
i called road services .
there'll be a 90 minute wait .
where are you?
you didn't say you'd be late .
i can't stand this !
please ...
please , i need you .
john?
there is a man .
patrick .
he's a client and he's ...
he's gay .
i don't understand this .
i don't understand ... us ... anymore .
i don't want this to be happening to us .
oh ...
there are lights .
there's a car coming .
i'll wave it down .
wait for me .
we'll talk when i get home , okay?
bye .
i love you .
you need sleep .
you wish .
what have we got?
locals got a call , about 12 : 30 am from the husband .
he gets home late , his wife's not there .
she's left messages on the answering machine , saying she ran off the road , she's making a call from a phone box , about 2kms down the road .
last call says she saw a car coming , she's gonna wave it down .
but she never makes it . $50 says it's the husband .
you're on .
mr. somers?
knox .
my wife's name's somers .
i'm detective zat .
this is my colleague , detective weis .
we've located your wife's car , mr. knox .
do you mind if we come in?
mr. knox , it appears that your wife ran off the road .
there's a telephone box several kilometers further along .
should i go there?
we're conducting a search , but ... if she accepted a lift from somebody , it's unlikely she'll be there .
would you mind answering a few questions?
i've been through all this with the police .
i know , but would you mind telling me what happened last night?
i got home around midnight .
her car wasn't here .
i came in , i checked the machine .
there were a couple of calls .
the last message said there was a car coming and she was going to wave it down .
that's when you called the police?
no , i waited about 20 minutes .
that's how long it would have ...
so you called at about 12 : 20?
yes , more or less .
do you have a photo of your wife we could have , please?
thank you .
how was your wife yesterday?
fine .
nothing troubling her?
no .
i am trying to find out about your wife's emotional state .
right now , i'd say it's pretty bad , wouldn't you?
none of this is particularly pleasant .
i can imagine .
imagine what?
you're married?
yeah .
if your wife got into a stranger's car ... a man , let's assume ... and didn't come home , what would you imagine?
right now , i'd be going mad .
yeah .
mr. knox , we need the tape .
she ... this is private .
in what sense?
she's upset .
she wasn't expecting anyone to listen to it .
i'll make sure this is returned to you .
you didn't wake me up last night .
i got in late .
what's with the face?
i fell over .
you were pissed?
a little .
come on , kids .
you packed your bag , hannah?
quickly .
come on .
hi !
hi .
hi .
seatbelts on , quickly .
nik got in late last night .
got nothing better to do than spying?
what?
what?
you know , don't invite nik in for coffee when i'm not here .
all right?
paula? !
hey .
that's the appointment book .
all her notes and session tapes are kept in a filing cabinet .
do you mind?
no .
how was she yesterday?
all right .
is she the kind of person that would get into a stranger's car?
no .
not after what happened to her daughter .
sarah , i'd like you to print me a list of her current clients ,
addresses and phone numbers too .
is that ethical?
probably not .
it's not that he might have ... slept with another woman ... it's that he might not tell me .
that would be the betrayal .
do you still love him?
good evening .
richard morecroft with abc news .
the police are inquiring into the disappearance of a woman in bushland , north of the city .
psychiatrist valerie somers was last seen on friday night .
her car was found abandoned along the lower ridge road .
she might have accepted a lift from a passing motorist .
ms. somers has recently completed a book about the murder of her own daughter .
the body of 11 year old eleanor knox was found dumped in a city laneway 18 months ago .
police are appealing to the public for information regarding ms. somers 'disappearance .
why do you think she turned off the freeway?
some people say it's shorter .
who's patrick?
i don't know .
she mentioned she was having some trouble with a client .
what kind of trouble?
she didn't go into it .
she doesn't talk about her clients .
why not?
it's unprofessional .
even between husband and wife?
yes .
i tell my wife everything .
that surprises me .
why?
most men hold something back .
you're some kind of academic , aren't you?
i'm dean of law .
i studied at harvard .
that's where valerie and i met .
i don't understand why she'd get into a car with a stranger .
maybe she didn't .
maybe she knew him .
how's your marriage been lately?
fine .
how's yours?
up and down .
where were you friday night?
am i a suspect in my wife's disappearance?
where were you friday night?
i was at work .
can anybody verify that?
no , i was alone .
nobody saw me .
nine times out of 10 when a wife goes missing , the husband knows something about it .
you're a prick .
the young constable will give you a ride .
anyway , we've been seeing each other for a while .
and you like him?
yes , i do .
very much .
so?
he comes encumbered ... with a wife .
don't you have a home to go to?
yes .
do you?
did you find anything?
she dedicated the book to john .
for teaching me to trust again .
did you listen to phelan's tapes?
yeah .
what did you think?
she didn't like the man .
go home .
you got an early start .
what about you?
soon .
okay .
you really look like shit .
go home .
thank you .
talked to mystery man yet?
he never came back .
silly bugger .
i'm not asleep .
did you watch the news?
yeah .
will you find her?
it's not looking good .
i saw her client list , sonja .
why didn't you tell me?
because it was private .
it was just something i had to do .
there was a time when there was no private between you and me .
that is because i had somebody i could talk to .
i have to tell you something ...
i have to tell you ...
i had an affair .
i slept with her twice .
i know it hurts you .
it hurts her ...
why?
because i'm numb .
i can't feel anything anymore .
just totally fucking numb .
why did you sleep on the couch?
i came in late last night .
i didn't want to wake your mama .
are you fighting?
yeah , a bit .
why?
there's something we've got to sort out .
you all right , mom?
yeah .
i'll be in the car .
can you grab something to eat?
we're running late .
are we gonna talk about this?
or you just going to punish me?
this is how you're gonna punish me?
i fucked up .
people fuck up .
really?
i don't .
you know what's so easy?
it's easy to go and find somebody .
you know what's hard?
what's hard is not to .
sonja , listen .
i just want ...
get off me .
god .
we'll talk about this tonight , all right?
oh ... get fucked !
i don't even know if i'll be here later .
hi .
did you know?
you're ready?
pete?
it's me .
can you come over?
what number is it?
406 .
you sure you're up to this?
mr. phelan .
we're investigating the disappearance of valerie somers .
we were hoping you could help us .
it's not a good time .
i was out late .
who with?
mr. phelan , the woman's missing .
you know what's happened to her?
not yet .
you had an appointment with her?
can you tell us how she was?
she seemed all right .
i don't know .
you don't know?
she's the therapist .
i wasn't focused on how she was .
how do you get along with her?
fine .
that's it?
fine?
we didn't end our last session on very good terms .
why is that?
we disagreed about something .
what was that?
what?
that guy you've been fucking?
married guy?
how did you know about that?
she records all her sessions .
that's private ...
yes , but under the circumstances ...
that's my life !
is there somebody in that room?
who is it?
your boyfriend?
could you ask him to come out?
he has nothing ...
leon !
what's the matter with you?
you don't have the right ...
who are you? !
you have no fucking right !
finished?
that went well .
your marriage is falling apart and so are you .
it's none of your business .
it is if you can't do your job !
if you don't like the way i'm handling things , take it up at the station .
push .
hello?
dylan?
hi , dad .
could i speak to your mom?
no , she's still pissed off at you .
all right .
tell her ... tell her i'll be home soon .
all right .
see you , dad .
what did he say?
he said that he's sorry , that he loves you , and he wants you to stop being angry with him .
you look bereft , leon .
the other question is , why don't you?
don't be deceived by appearances .
want a whiskey?
somebody may have hurt your wife .
i need to know if it was you .
i didn't hurt her .
she was upset on the phone .
she was afraid .
of what?
of being alone .
of me not being there for her .
why weren't you there for her?
while your wife was in some phone box , calling for your help , where were you?
are you seeing someone else?
is it an affair?
no .
with a man?
is that what's going on?
i believe that's what valerie thought was going on .
what are you talking about?
for some reason , she believe you were involved with patrick phelan .
is that it?
were you seeing men on the side?
i don't have to listen to this?
yes , you do .
my wife's out there somewhere .
what are you doing about it?
i'm trying to find her .
but i need to know what's inside her head .
i don't know .
i don't know .
have you ever cheated on your wife?
no .
never desired another woman?
yes , of course .
but you never acted on it?
no .
well , you're a better man than i am .
so there is someone else?
no .
there was someone once .
a woman .
once that's happened , you're never entirely believed again .
something gets broken , permanently .
trust , i suppose .
when that happens , anything's possible , it would seem .
you don't lose a daughter , like we lost eleanor , without some damage .
so where were you?
i left work late .
i stopped at the place where my daughter was killed .
i go there ... a lot .
valerie didn't know that .
you didn't tell her?
why not , john?
what holds your marriage together , leon?
loyalty?
love?
maybe habits sometimes , passion , our kids .
ours was held together by grief .
there wasn't much else left .
you didn't love her anymore?
i'm saying that sometimes , love isn't enough .
leon !
where the hell have you been?
we got a call from a man , saying his wife saw a neighbor throw a shoe into a vacant lot on the night valerie disappeared .
she's got the shoe .
black leather .
where are we going?
this could be tricky .
why?
i know the woman .
oh jesus !
detective claudia weis .
leon !
we had a drink the other night .
how are you?
good .
you'd better come in .
my wife's pretty upset .
jane , it's the police .
this is leon and ...
claudia . and claudia .
jane .
is that the shoe?
yeah .
you shouldn't have touched the shoe ,
mrs ...?
o'may .
it's jane o'may .
right , mrs. o'may , you shouldn't have touched it .
well , i did .
yeah , but you shouldn't have .
well , i did , didn't i?
it's on the table .
could we have some coffee?
yeah .
it's out the back here .
thanks .
i'll give you a hand .
are you all right?
have you got a light?
yeah .
how do you want to handle this?
you're a policeman , aren't you?
why don't you just do your job?
i've never seen you before .
can i speak to paula , please?
it's urgent .
can you tell her to call me as soon as she can?
yes , as soon as she can , please .

i'll give you a couple of minutes .
so i go to the window , at about 11 : 30 .
i go to the window , and he's chucking that . and he threw it over there , and he was looking like he was ... really guilty .
nik .

mrs. d'amato .

i believe you met detective constable weis .
i want to see nik .
your husband is helping us with our inquiries .

he was seen throwing a shoe into a vacant lot .
who saw him?
a search was conducted in the block opposite your house .
mmm?

my kids play there .
every kid on the street plays there .
they found the shoe .
it was identified as belonging to ms. valerie somers .
she's been missing since last friday night .

nik's in trouble .
they won't let me see him .
i don't know what to do .

everything's okay .
your kids are really safe .
i'm sorry .
i'll get there as soon as i can .
okay .
thank you .
bye , janey .
does she know you rang the police?
no .
they say you've ... hurt some woman , nik .
i didn't , babe .
i didn't touch her .
don't .
not yet .
what is it , hannah?
the baby's sick .
what is it?
what is it?
he's burning up .

he needs panadol .
panadol .
poor little thing .
it's all right for babies?
i don't know .
only get half .
baby panadol .
what?
baby panadol .
you'll have to go to the chemist's .
there's some at our house .
i'd met some mates for a drink .
we used to work together .
it's something we keep up .
we drank more than we should have , so i took the backroad .
the police don't patrol it .
it must have been about ... a quarter to 12 : 00 ... and i see this woman standing at the side of the road .
i don't want to stop .
it's late , and i'm thinking paula will get worried .
but what do i do?
the woman needs help .
so i pull over .
my car ran off the road .
get in .
thanks .
what's your name?
valerie .
i'm nik .
it turns out she lives in one of those houses by the bay .
there's a string of houses along there .
it's out of my way .
it's in the opposite direction .
she doesn't say much .
i can tell she doesn't want to talk , so i just ...
leave it .
but i know this shortcut and i just don't ...
i just don't think .
and before i can say , " this is the short way , " she's gone .
what do you mean , she's gone?
hey !
wait !
i'm not going to hurt you .
trust me !
you know ...
i thought that ... if i'd leave her alone ... she'd stop being afraid of me .
i just ...
i just left her there .
when i got home , i saw her ...
i saw her shoe on the floor of my car .
and i ...
jesus , i just wanted to help the woman ...
why didn't you report it , nik?
because i thought she'd be all right .
i thought she'd find her way out of there .
then when i ... and when i saw her on the news ... that she was missing , i ...
by then who was going to believe me?
thank you ... for letting me know .
bye .
paula?
come in .
hi .
hey , sweetie .
daddy will be home soon .
maybe they can come back later .
they've been so good for me .
no , i don't think so .
paula .
he didn't do it , jane .
how do you know?
he told me .
paula?
what could i do , paula?
all right .
go inside and put your bags in your rooms .
stupid ...
you've got no right , jane !
you hear me? !
you have no fucking right !
i don't want to see you anywhere near my kids again .
i was home , leon .
i didn't pick up the phone .
john?
there's a man ...
patrick .
he's a client and he's ... he's gay .
i don't understand this .
i don't understand ... us ... anymore .
i don't want this to be happening to us .
oh ... there are lights .
there's a car coming .
i'll wave it down .
wait for me .
we'll talk when i get home , okay?
bye .
i love you .
i thought she would come home .
it's not that he might have ... slept with another woman .
it's ... that he might not tell me .
that would be the betrayal .
do you still love him?
yeah .
i still love him .
i don't want to lose you .
what?
i don't want to lose you .
i couldn't bear it .
