help me get near him .
this way .
this way , mother .
mother ...
mother ...
i'm here ...
i'm here ...
see , mother , i make all things new .
who is that?
who?
she's the galilean's mother .
let's go .
come on !
don't fret , my daughter .
don't fret .
are you blind?
can't you see , he can't go on?
help him !
you !
yes , you !
get over here !
what do you want from me?
this criminal can't carry his cross by himself anymore .
you will help him !
now get going !
i can't do that .
it's none of my business .
get someone else !
help him !
he is a holy man .
do as i tell you .
now move !
let's go !
all right , but i'm an innocent man , forced to carry the cross of a condemned man .
stay here .
wait for me .
permit me , my lord .
who do you think you are?
get away from here .
impossible people !
someone stop this !
stop !
stop !
leave him alone !
if you don't stop , i won't carry that cross one more step .
i don't care what you do to me !
all right , all right , let's get moving .
we don't have all day .
let's go !
let's go ... ... jew !
almost there .
we're nearly there .
almost done .
you have heard it said ... ... you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy .
but i say to you ... ... love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ...
for if you love only those who love you ...
... what reward is there in that?
i am the good shepherd .
i lay down my life for my sheep .
no one takes my life from me ... ... but i lay it down of my own accord .
i have power to lay it down ... ... and power to take it up again .
this command is from my father .
get away now , you're free to go .
go on !
go on !
you can get up now !
get up , your majesty .
can't you get up?
we haven't got all day .
come on , move !
we're ready .
get up , your highness .
you are my friends .
there is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends .
i cannot be with you much longer , my friends .
you cannot go where i am going .
my commandment to you after i am gone is this ...
love one another .
as i have loved you , so love one another .
you believe in me .
you know that i am the way , the truth , and the life .
and no one comes to the father but by me .
further out ...
idiots !
let me show you how to do it .
like this !
there !
no , get in there .
hold the hand open like this .
father , forgive them ...
father , father my father ... my god ...
they don't know ... they don't know ...
stupid mongrels !
turn the wood over on its face , idiots !
take this and eat .
this is my body which is given up for you .
take this and drink .
this is my blood of the new covenant ... ... which is given for you and for many , for the forgiveness of sins .
do this in memory of me .
if you are the son of god , why don't you save yourself?
prove to us you are who you say you are .
you said you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days ... ... and yet you cannot come down from that cross .
if he is the messiah ... ... i say let him come down from the cross ... ... so that we may see and believe .
father , forgive them ... ... they know not what they do .
listen ... ... he prays for you .
we deserve this , gesmas , but he does not .
i have sinned , and my punishment is just .
you would be justified in condemning me .
i ask only that you remember me , lord , when you enter your kingdom .
amen , i tell you , on this day you shall be with me in paradise .
i thirst .
flesh of my flesh ... ... heart of my heart ...
my son , let me die with you .
woman ... ... behold your son .
son , behold ...
... your mother .
there is no one left .
no one , jesus !
my god ...
... why have you forsaken me?
it is accomplished .
father , into your hands ...
i commend ... my spirit .
cassius !
hurry !
he's dead !
make sure !
