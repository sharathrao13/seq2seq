i need to talk to you about smashing the windows ...
i'm going out of town for two days .
where you going?
hawaii .
but you can't tell my sisters .
hawaii?
that is so wonderful .
just don't tell my sisters .
i have to get more pudding for this trip to hawaii .
i realize it sounds strange , but it's not .
so would you like to come with me?
right now?
yes .
i saw the teriyaki chicken for $ 1 . 79 , then the soup was a real deal .
but to stumble across the pudding , it's tremendous how people don't look .
they don't look at the fine print .
oh , my .
okay !
you can go to places in the world with pudding .
that is funny .
that's funny .
yes !
it's gonna work .
i'm coming .
i'm coming .

lena , i'm coming .
i'm gonna get on line .
lena .
aloha .
barry , i'll be on line .
okay .
i'm coming .
okay .
what do you mean?
it doesn't say six to eight weeks anywhere .
it takes that long to process and validate the order .
i had this planned in my mind , okay?
i could get the pudding to you today .
i'm leaving today .
i've explained this .
it takes time to process .
how am i supposed to know this if you don't tell me this?
if it's not in the fine print .
that's an impossibility .
it takes time to process .
i didn't see a six or an eight .
this is bullcrap to me .
that's how long it takes to process .
hello?
hello?
hello?
hello?
all right !
the pudding takes six to eight weeks to process , so that won't work .
i'll take a bath on that today .
but here's what i'm gonna tell you .
now , the pudding ...
yeah?
you okay?
the chair broke .
we'll get to the pudding later .
i'm gonna go now .

lena .
i'm so sorry .
i'm so sorry i left you at the hospital .
i called a phone sex line ...
i called a phone sex line before i met you ... ... and four blond brothers came after me ... ... and they hurt you , and i'm sorry .
then i had to leave again because i wanted to make sure ... ... you never got hurt again .
and i have a lot of pudding ... ... and in six to eight weeks , it can be redeemed .
so if you could just give me that much time ... ... i think i can get enough mileage to go with you wherever you go ... ... if you have to travel for your work .
because i don't ever want to be anywhere without you .
so could you just let me redeem the mileage?
you left me at the hospital .
i'm sorry .
you can't do that .
if you just give me six to eight weeks ... ... i can redeem the mileage ... ... and i can go with you wherever you have to travel .
so here we go .
