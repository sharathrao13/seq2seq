every life is a riddle .
the answer to mine is a knowledge born of darkness .
it wasn't always so .
in the beginning , i still had questions .
in the beginning , my mystery still remained .
brother dominic ... scholar of the catholic arcane .
believer in the unsanitized church .
a church that no longer believes in itself .
the church of stigmata ... and exorcism , saints ... and demons ... and me .
i believe in many things .
so do i.
and right now , i believe it's time .
are you ready to make your confession? .
forgive me , alex .
i have sinned against you .
there he is .
that's alex .
he's young .
but an old soul , clive .
he's an old soul .
mea culpa .
mea culpa .
mea maxima culpa .
corpus christi?
amen .
corpus christi?
amen .
corpus christi?
amen .
i need to speak with you .
do you always say the mass in latin?
it's how i was taught .
it belies your age .
and with your back to your audience , no less .
you know , six or 700years ago ... they wouldn't have seen you at all .
you'd have sung the mass in latin behind a huge choir screen ... out of the sight of a congregation who was only allowed to ...
listen .
i think you would have liked the choir screen , alex .
you're a contradiction .
what i am is stuck here because the church doesn't know what to do with me .
well , the church doesn't know what the hell to do with itself .
look , i won't pretend i don't know you have certain qualifications ... certain skills , that set you apart from other priests .
however , the diocese has certain questions about your faith , alex .
so , what do you want from me? .
well , i have sad news for you .
dominic , the head of your order  i know who he is .
he's dead .
today .
in rome .
is this your mother?
say good bye , alex .
it's time to say good bye .
good bye .
leave your tears here and then forget them .
alex?
alex? .
alex? .
how is it that a cardinal has enough time to come and tell me this? .
because i loved him .
because he was my mentor .
because the circumstances of his death are ... curious .
i need to go to rome .
the diocese will arrange a flight .
in the name of god , in the name of jesus christ , i order you back to hell .
your time is coming .
in the name of god , in the name of jesus christ , i order you back to hell .
in the name of god , in the name of jesus christ , i order you back to hell .
fuck your god !
all mouth , no trousers .
your church will be lost , priest .
the dark pope ... rises .
hello? .
ah , thomas .
i've been trying to reach you , mate .
alex .
how are you , spaghetti? .
yeah , listen to me .
dominic died .
dominic? .
yeah .
ah , no .
when did it happen? .
last night .
where are you? .
in new york? .
at st. anthony's? .
yeah .
listen , i'm going to rome , thomas .
when? .
tomorrow .
and guess what .
so are you .
just be there .
hi .
hi .
when did they release you? .
i was released today .
years ago , it was a dorm for all the priests .
now it's empty .
you're here .
true .
oh , i'll wait .
uh , we're looking for alex bernier .
that's me .
is there something wrong? . just a heads up , father .
you know a ...
mara williams? .
yes .
she escaped today from the mental health facility where she was remanded by the court .
remanded , huh? .
and what does this have to do with me? .
well , she was locked up for trying to kill you , wasn't she? .
that was the main reason , yes .
i just thought you d like to know she's unaccounted for .
look , i could have a car drive by here once in a while .
no , i'm fine .
thank you .
well , like i said , a heads up .
you know , it says here i couldn't make it out in this copy that she , uh that she shot you at an exercise class? .
no , at an exorcism .
oh .
have a good night .
you , too , father .
you lied .
you said they released you .
no , i didn't .
i didn't lie .
i said i was released .
i didn't say who did it .
mara? .
alex ... you didn't say good bye .
they said it would be better that i didn't see you for a while .
for a year? .
i don't know .
i started painting again .
did you? .
yeah .
flowers mostly .
i wanna paint sunflowers , but i don't have the guts .
do you think i'm crazy? .
i know you're not .
why'd you come here? .
i heard you call me .
mara , don't say that .
okay , i got a feeling ... that i should be with you ... in case one of us has to say good bye .
i've never been to rome before .
is it amazing?
i bet it is .
it scares me ever since i was a boy .
and you're staying here .
no , i'm not staying here .
i can't stay here .
and you need me whether you know it or not .
and? .
the nightingales are gone .
are they? .
yeah .
they've been gone for about a year .
same as you .
alex , look at me .
it's you and me .
you and me till the wheels fall off .
promise you won't try to kill me .
cross my heart , hope to die .
it's here .
hey .
mara? .
what are they? .
orphans .
but of what i have no idea .
i've been in worse places .
it just needs light , that's all .
what are those? .
aramaic .
it's the language of christ .
what does it say? .
barath mae .
blood in .
down there , barath sec .
blood out .
this must have been where they found dominic's body .
alex , what are you thinking? .
it was a ceremony .
the message i got said suicide .
sleeping pills , signore .
is that him? .
yes , it's him .
thank you .
no , no .
i didn't pay to look at his face .
if you don't mind .
what are these? .
okay , let's go , please .
hurry up .
no , no , no .
what are these? .
do you know what these are? .
maybe a birthmark .
i don't know .
i'm not a doctor .
that's not a birthmark .
when's the body due to be released to the church? .
it isn't .
when we are done with it , it goes to the state ... for burial in the state cemetery .
okay .
please , let's go .
please .
come with me .
it's always nice to see a priest .
and a carolingian , no less .
you've seen others? .
a dominic sousa , perhaps? .
carolingians ... you surpass even the jesuits in your heretical search for knowledge .
it's important to stay inside the lines .
what lines? .
this way .
those were the marks .
dominic , what were you doing? .
bread and salt eaten off the body ... the sins of one man consumed by the other " '
a sin eater .
if hitler had had one in the bunker , he'd be sitting on a cloud right now .
of course , sin eaters ... haven't existed for two centuries , have they? .
what did dominic buy from you? .
many things over the years .
last time , a vellum parchment written in aramaic .
what did it say? .
i'm not as clever as dominic ... scholar of mysteries .
he delved deep and dark .
always after knowledge .
i think he'd have sold his soul for knowledge .
do you? .
his heretic soul or something precious to him .
is there a price tag on your head? .
what's that supposed to mean? .
sometimes it's better for a priest not to know .
knowledge is the enemy of faith .
and sometimes when you look into the abyss ... the abyss looks back into you .
look , his order meant everything to him .
now , dominic should be buried with his order in the concezione cemetery .
your order .
his former order .
the carolingians , not many of you left in the world .
yeah , a dying breed .
look , and when they die , it's the concezione cemetery .
suicide is a cardinal sin .
dominic didn't commit suicide .
it makes no difference .
he had been excommunicated , excluded from our society and sacraments .
there is no salvation outside the church " '
yes , i know my latin .
unlike your manners .
respect what you are .
well , what i am is my concern .
thank you .
listen , i'm sorry .
i am .
i [ exhales ]
i need the theosophic council to convene as soon as possible .
the council? .
it hasn't convened in years .
for what purpose? .
tell them i found a sin eater .
a sin eater? .
here? .
at the start of the new millennium? .
how many other impossible things do you believe in? .
it's not impossible .
i've seen the marks on dominic's body myself .
your mentor was excommunicated ... for rejection of articles of faith .
heresy .
accept it .
he took his own life because he couldn't bear that .
grazie , franca .
father alex .
ciao , maria .
ciao .
grazie .
in nomine patris , et filii , et spiritus sancti .
amen .
i n the name of god ...
i command you to return from whence you came .
i n the name of god
in the name of jesus , god , and the holy virgin , i order you back to hell !
well , off to hell yourself .
what kind of a greeting's that? .
you're late .
never too late , alex .
witness the repentant thief ... crucified alongside our lord savior .
quick thinker , eh? .
how you doing '? .
ah , i'm grand .
so , did you bury him? .
yeah .
rogue priest reading 'rites over an excommunicado .
damn dirty job , but someone's gotta do it .
well , cheers .
to the last of the carolingians .
you and me .
cheers .
what just passed through here , alex? .
demon spawn in the guise of children .
nothing i couldn't handle .
who summoned those nasties up? .
dominic , i think .
they were camped outside his apartment .
oh , speaking of the apartment , i met your girlfriend .
she's not my girlfriend .
well , she should be .
she said you'd be at the concezione .
you told her it was a restaurant? .
well , she would have come with me otherwise .
oh , women .
can't live with 'em .
can't live with 'em .
come on .
sin eater .
come on .
sin eater .
in absolution , the burden of guilt ...
would be transmuted to the sin eater ... as would the knowledge of the transgressions " '
wait .
you mean he'd know what your sins were? .
even the details? .
he'd know them and feel the burden of them .
he'd spend sleepless nights over things others had done .
he'd have the ascendancy to free a man's soul .
and damn his own .
we're carolingians , alex and i.
now , in a way , that makes us responsible .
they say the practice of sin eating began with banished members of our order .
come on .
that's like saying that sheep ... are responsible for the sweaters that get made from their wool .
maybe they are , mara , girl .
i found the vellum dominic bought .
i'll translate it for you .
okay ...
place the instrument of delivery over the heart " '
it must be some kind of weapon .
and then look .
barath mae , barath sec . '" blood in , blood out .
and drive into the heart " 'now , the rest is missing .
still , you get the idea .
i'm not sure i do .
well , they're instructions ... on how to kill a sin eater .
dominic trained us to deal with ghosts and demons and all manner of undead ... but this sin eater , he's a living man .
well , whatever he is , he killed dominic .
maybe , maybe not .
i've seen another copy of this somewhere .
so , we meet again .
jesus , the fuckin 'cavalry .
so , how are you finding our city of emperors , our city of martyrs? .
would you care for a beer , your eminence?
or something a little stronger?
and you are? .
he's thomas .
she's mara .
we're the catholic pete , linc and julie .
well , i am michael cardinal driscoll , and among other things ...
i'm head of the theosophic council .
a bit like the dead letter department of the post office , i'm afraid .
i believe michelangelo went blind from candlelight .
dominic didn't believe in electricity .
yes , but a sin eater? .
you couldn't have shocked the bishop more if you d said ... you'd been possessed by some phoenician demon and then demanded an exorcism .
the exorcism was on friday .
well , today is monday .
and yet , i think there may be credence to what you say .
matter of fact , i know there is .
a sin eater a renegade who provides a path to heaven outside of the church , outside of our savior .
if you believe such things , he has the power ... to grant redemption to the unrepentant .
sort of a heretical wrench in the cogs of our catholic machinery .
you two were dominic's chosen .
what do you know about his excommunication? .
nothing .
he wouldn't speak of it .
well , dominic believed this other ... this man was based right here in rome .
now , that's all i know because that's all he told me ... and i assume that the two of you plan to seek him out .
otherwise , i am just spinning my wheels here .
sadly , the church no longer has the will to dispatch .
thank god we still have the tools .
the instrument of delivery , if you will .
now , if you il excuse me ... there are even more pressing matters weighing on the vatican tonight .
signorina .
what could be more important than this? .
they say the pope is ill .
i n fact , they say that he's dying .
and that man , mara , girl , that american is front runner for the job .
that man that just asked you to kill somebody? .
left it to our discretion , i'd say .
where'd you get that? .
last year .
got drunk , woke up with it .
that's very strange .
sailors get anchors , so i'm a priest .
it's still strange , tommy .
i'm glad dominic believed in bathrooms .
i usually just open the window and lean out .
what's strange is that you re a priest sleeping on the couch ... instead of a man sleeping in bed with her .
thomas , two days ago , she was in a mental institution .
so , she's crazy about you .
can you look me in the eye and tell me you still wanna be a priest? .
can you? .
there are other ways to serve .
hmm , to serve .
it's knowledge i'm after .
knowledge .
when i look under a rock , my gut reacts to what i see .
i don't wonder how it got under the rock to begin with .
you guys tired? .
go upstairs and get some sleep .
good night .
night .
sweet dreams , yeah? .
you too .
i know who she is , but who is she? .
tell me something about her .
hmm .
she's a she's a painter .
really good too .
i don't know , there's something about her that
she sees things differently .
she feels things differently .
i wish i never saw her face .
alex , you're a fool .
same as you were once .
alex, your head rules your heart .
oh , and what rules yours? .
laughter , of course .
hey , hey , you laugh to keep from going mad .
you laugh to keep the wolves at bay .
it's still laughter .
as for you , spaghetti , choose life .
right .
let your heart wear the crown , not your head .
here we are .
time to see chirac .
who is he anyways? .
a rising darkness .
a rising darkness? .
we're looking for rosalinda .
sure .
she's over there .
girl with the faraway eyes .
we need you to take us to chirac .
don't start your posturing , you pagan worshipping pig .
you owe me a debt .
my friend and i are looking for the other .
just what does he mean by the dying? .
ask him .
oh , shit .
uh [ exhales ]
where where can i find the sin eater? .
the other will find you .
upon the stone where all is built [ gasping ]
he brings you claves ... regni caelorum .
claves regni caelorum?
the keys to the kingdom of heaven .
upon the stone where all is built .
upon the stone where all is built .
ah , i hate riddles .
petrus , stone .
petram .
peter is the stone upon which all , right , the church is built .
st. peter's .
well , the other will find me then .
st. peter's .
doesn't anyone just meet for coffee anymore? .
and he will bring you claves regni  [ gasps ]
alex !
come on .
let's get out of here .
thomas .
thomas .
no point in hanging 'around .
thomas !
tommy , love .
how long have you been a priest , thomas?
certain pleasures are forever out of reach .
denied .
thomas !
leave it for a sunny day .
come on .
al i mouth and no trousers .
remember that girl in dublin?
megan was her name .
did you feel foolish , tommy?
in love with a whore .
thomas? .
it's personal .
ignore it .
the first and only lesson , remember?
tommy love .
oh , tommy .
i love you , tommy .
come on , mate .
never give them an inch .
tommy .
not one fucking inch !
thomas? .
thomas !
thomas !
i n the name of god and jesus christ ... to hell with you !
i love you , tommy .
i'll pray for you , tommy .
thomas !
shit !
i said there was no point in hanging around .
you never laugh , alex .
it's not good for the soul .
i thought you might be the nurse .
thomas , what happened? .
where's alex? .
he's off in search of coffee .
as for me , i was hoisted up by me own petard .
mara , if i can ask ... what happened between you and alex? .
it's okay .
if i was embarrassed , i'd wear bracelets .
my little brother was murdered , and they brought alex in to consult .
the filmore murders .
dominic sent alex .
that was his first time on his own .
mara , i hear confession all the time .
nightingales .
what about them? .
those are the birds that i'd hearsinging ... right before the headaches started .
these headaches , they'd go on for weeks .
they were ... blinding .
so , i did this , and even that didn't help .
alex performed an exorcism .
yeah .
alex took away my pain ... and i fell in love with a priest who couldn't love me back .
love .
you traded one pain for another .
something terrible is going to happen to alex , thomas .
i don't know what it is ... but i know that it's worse than death .
am i the answer to your prayer?
my friends call me william .
william eden .
i'm not your friend .
that remains to be seen .
i know what you re feeling , alex , and you're right .
god exists .
he just doesn't give a damn .
magnificence .
flesh rots .
st. peter's remains .
this impossible dome , alex ... it was raised by my brother when i was still a boy .
blood and sweat built this ... not faith .
it was michelangelo who drew the dome on a piece of paper ... but it was left to my brother to figure out a way ... to raise it halfway to heaven ... and it was my honor , each day to bring him something to eat ...
and ask him of the world outside of my own .
papa? .
hey , will i i'am .
you brought some food .
thank you .
tell me a story , phillip , a story of jerusalem .
jerusalem? .
phillip !
phillip !
phillip !
he's dying .
i can give no absolution .
he was excommunicated last year in jerusalem .
good enough to build god's house ... but not to let him enter his kingdom .
is that it? .
william , go .
fetch the sin eater .
in jerusalem , my brother gave a dying arab a drink of water .
there was no well , so he gave him holy water .
my brother gave the church his youth in jerusalem ... his blood at st. peter's , but when he lay dying ... they deserted him .
when his soul stretched out , caught between heaven and hell ... it was the other who delivered him .
it was the other who gave him peace .
i always loved my brother , alex ... but the church i grew to hate .
this ... is the other way .
this ... is the other way .
i can teach you ... if you are willing .
i was willing .
and so , i was taught .
did you kill dominic sousa? .
the church killed him .
he died when he was excommunicated .
his body continued on a while , but his spirit was dead .
that's a lie .
he was , alex .
he was ruined , broken , not playacting .
don't talk to me of lies .
i lost it in 1 602 .
i had dinner with caravaggio and drank too much wine .
it's a means an instrument for ridding the world of the other .
answer my question .
did you kill dominic? .
he killed himself , alex , after the church abandoned him ... after they took away his reason to live .
they did to him as they did to my brother , alex .
and you know what i did? .
you know what i did for dominic? .
i gave him absolution .
i took on the burden of his sins , and i gave him peace .
not the church i.
so don't talk to me of lies , alex .
dominic was like a father to me .
i'm just trying to understand .
come with me .
every fear hides a wish .
don t you think? .
so what is it to be a sin eater? .
what is it not to be one? .
i know of no other way to be .
it seems beyond a man's judgment .
forgiveness is god's domain .
i'm just an instrument .
like any great power , it depends on how it's used .
and how do you use it? .
as i see fit .
i'm not a threat to the church .
i'm an insult , an embarrassment .
but you re a carolingian .
you know how it feels to be outside .
i serve the church .
serve yourself .
get alex some fresh clothes and a hot bath if he would like .
and then take him someplace quiet where he can sit .
if you would like anything , anything can be arranged .
how long have i been asleep for? .
a few hours .
what is it you want , alex? .
i want to learn the truth .
truth? .
the terrible thing about searching for the truth is that sometimes you find it .
not to mention it makes you very unwelcome at parties .
it makes you unwelcome anywhere , even in church .
who are you? .
i'm all that remains when everything else turns to dust .
but to put it simply , alex , i'm very , very tired .
are you a man? .
i shit .
i fuck .
i shave .
does that make me a man? .
can you die? .
you tell me .
i laugh .
i cry .
once , i loved .
does that make me a man? .
i don't know .
what about you , alex? .
are you a man?
i'm a priest .
you understand the difference ... the truth of it .
good .
do you remember what keats said about the truth? .
beauty is truth .
truth is beauty " '
keeping that in mind ... my original question , what is it you want? .
the truth ... or something beautiful?
something beautiful .
beauty is truth , alex .
does your oasis have a name? .
mara .
her name is mara .
so say it .
say what you want , alex .
if it's the truth , then why be afraid? .
say it .
i want mara .
then you're a man ... and not a priest .
and if mara s what you want , then you should go and get her .
shh .
you'll wake her .
she might be dreaming .
how we run from the things we need .
he's dying .
that's why i'm here .
rembrandt did some remarkable things .
this isn't one of them .
it's a de gelder .
but only i'll know that .
put it in the car .
your services don't come cheap .
no , they don't .
what did dominic give you? .
i mean he , uh he had nothing .
that's not true .
he gave me friendship once , and i returned it .
what do you think you can do for him that i haven't? .
i am the conductor of the night train .
the answer to your question is infinite .
science , medicine .
you give people nothing to hold ... except words they can't pronounce .
cancers that act capriciously .
you measure life with a ruler ... and a bathroom scale .
you take away ... you kill the mystery that makes life mean something .
and you pretend to understand it all ... when you understand nothing , when you are nothing ... when your dust has more value than you do .
christ on the cross ... he gave forgiveness to a thief being crucified alongside him .
the church would not have allowed it .
but christ did .
i know this man .
that's marcus burnham .
i read about him .
a lost sheep .
a man full of regret and fear .
such fear .
they say he got away with murder .
that remains to be seen .
blood in " '
blood out " '
from jerusalem my brother said it held a splinter from the true cross .
but the world is rotten with lies .
bread for the host .
and salt for the blood .
are you ready to make your confession? .
uh huh .
forgiveness for the unforgivable .
breathtaking .
i forgive you .
i'm i'm free .
my cross .
alex , give me my cross , please .
so , what do you think of what i do? .
it's not immortality , alex .
you will grow weary .
but 500 years? .
1, 000? .
imagine what you could accomplish given that time .
imagine the knowledge that waits .
what are you saying? .
i'm used up .
my time is done .
but i believe in the legacy of it all .
i should not be the last of my kind .
there ... should be another other .
but why me? .
in the end , alex , like recognizes like .
i'm not like you .
alex , you buried an excommunicated priest in consecrated ground ... after the church had forbidden it .
you went around their authority , alex ... the same as i do .
you're exactly like me .
i hope you like sunflowers .
i love sunflowers .
you know that .
why? .
why do you love sunflowers? .
because i always thought that ... when god was making beautiful things ... he messed up with sunflowers .
how? .
well , 'cause they look like i don't know .
they look like crooked teeth around a mouth that's too big , kind of .
yeah .
but ... just when he was about to start over ... he realized that's what made them beautiful .
they were a brilliant mistake .
like you and me .
where did you go? .
william eden ...
offered me the world last night .
when i saw these , i knew .
knew what? .
that all i want is you .
tell me what it is .
it's you and me .
it's you and me till the wheels fall off .
yeah .
that's right .
i hadn't expected you so soon .
how are you feeling? .
formal .
the pain has passed .
all that remains is the knowledge gained .
i brought you this , because i believe it's yours .
and i have an answer for you .
haste .
that doesn't bode well .
my answer to your offer is no .
i don't want to be your successor .
was i that wrong about you? .
we have a lot in common .
i'll give you that .
can i ask you a question? .
of course .
go ahead .
yesterday you said you once loved .
were you ever married? .
i've had many wives over the years .
but my love , that was centuries ago .
they grow old , and they die .
and i remain .
maybe you il understand , then .
mara i love her .
well , that's fine .
have it all mara too .
there's no need to choose .
you're not a priest anymore .
don't you see? .
i
i don't want mara to grow old without me .
alex , the greatest truth of all is that love cannot last .
you'll grow tired of it .
bored .
i'll still be here .
and so will my offer .
yeah .
good bye , william eden .
if i ve learned one thing , alex ... it's that only in death do we ever really say good bye .
you want to know what i think?
do i have a choice? .
i think he's evil .
i don't think you should have given him the dagger .
and mostly , spaghetti , i don't think he's gonna take no for an answer .
it's the only answer i've got .
dominic trained us for what? .
i'm not a priest anymore , thomas  for what? .
to dispatch ghosts , demons and all manner of undead .
that's right .
you said so yourself eden's a living man .
well , i was wrong .
and as soon as i can move , i go back underground ... see if chirac knows where we can find the rest of this .
it's time to walk away .
let it go .
no walking away , alex .

i il be back here later .
alex , i'm serious .
yeah , and i'm starting to laugh .
just like you told me to .
get some sleep .
is it dark where you go , mara?
is your pain shapeless ... or does it take form? .
what are you doing here? .
i came to see you .
i thought we should finally meet .
i've heard many confessions .
i never made one .
did you know alex's mother killed herself? .
has he ever told you that?
how do you know about his mom? .
i was there .
his father died in a car accident .
i was there then too .
like me , alex was defined ... by specific events in his youth .
in his case , they were too important to be left to fate .
you killed them? .
and dominic helped me mold him .
dominic gave me alex .
that was his sin .
you still haven't answered my question , mara .
is it dark where you go , mara? .
when the nightingales sing? .
hmm? .
i brought them to you .
i placed you in alex's path .
your love is my creation ... manufactured like an automobile .
you don't need to worry .
alex will be fine .
i il see to it .
i'm sorry , girl ... but this world is too much with me .
i'll take you to a place where it isn't dark anymore ... where the sun shines all the time .
i'm sorry .

buon giorno , mr. alex .
eden !
he's not here .
where is he? .
we thought you would know , mr. alex .
eden !
he said to say good bye .
he told me to tell you that everything's in order .
everything that once was his is now yours .
what's going on here? .
what's going on here? .
barath mae , barath sec . '
jesus , mary , and joseph .
and watch your language .
it's a set up .
now ...
kiss the ring ... and i'll spare your life .
blasphemer .
blasphemer .
so ... has the world gone mad? .
no .
it still makes deals .
mine was with william eden .
i opened the vatican vaults and retrieved the dagger ...
william eden had lost 400 years ago .
in return , he compromised certain votes ... of certain cardinals .
for my deal with william eden ...
i will become pope .
a warrior pope .
a pope of a church that will reclaim its property ... and its sanctity and its power .
blasphemer !
aaah !
pagan worshipping blasphemer !
i need to speak with eden .
you know what i mean .
the other .
no .
i'm asking you .
i seek the other .
he ends where he began in st. peter's .
we hang priests here !
the weak ones !
mara died .
slit her wrists .
i've got to go .
i've got to go .
alex .
am i the answer to your prayer? .
you just might be .
i performed the ceremony ... found mara dying . found mara dying .
i did it to set her free .
how did it feel? .
like i was god .
what about her sins? .
do you have knowledge of them too? .
yes .
there weren't many .
hmm .
she was a good girl .
one thing about it troubles me , though .
don't intellectualize something so visceral .
it's just , in the church , suicide is a mortal sin ... and i didn't feel it at all .
maybe the church is wrong .
no .
she was murdered .
one day , you will realize , alex ... that because of what i did ... in your heart , mara , your love ... will live forever .
no !
barath mae
barath sec .
now you'll know what i know , alex .
time to look into the abyss .
there are wonders there .
i feel like i'm ... 1 0 years old again .
i'm home .
i ... understand .
god save me , i understand .
the parchment it's not how you kill the other .
it's how you become the other .
i'm sorry .
i found out too late .
i won't leave you like this , alex .
there has to be another way .
when i learn what it is , i'll find you ... even if it s to kill you .
morning .
i sent for the sin eater .
i am the sin eater .
huh .
so eden gets what he asks for ... and you and i are left behind .
what you told the vatican has ruined me .
did you know that?
deposed ... and degraded .
it was you , wasn't it? .
i learned a lot in a very short time .
and in the end ... the only secret people keep is immortality .
you ready? .
it's the confession , not the priest ... that gives you absolution .
do you understand? .
yes .
are you ready to make your confession? .
yes .
she was like a sunflower .
god's beautiful mistake .
choke on your own filth .
and now it is i.
i have been blessed and cursed ... for now i possess the keys to the kingdom of heaven .
i will forgive those who deserve freedom .
i will damn those who have damned themselves .
i will learn to live after love has died .
i am the sin eater .
