inside your son an ancestor is protesting , causing this fever .
until that ancestor obtains justice the fever will shake your child like a fish out of water , flapping its gills .
here .
when you sense the fever coming , you soak these roots in water .
make him take a few swallows , and then wash him with the rest .
tell me what's on your mind .
is his father with the ancestors?
you know better than i do .
do you want to know if your husband is still alive?
all right .
bring the sand up to your lips .
blow on it .
focus on your desire to know what's happened to your husband .
pour the sand here .
i don't see his grave in the ancestors 'cemetery .
it's the heat .
if a man has no tomb waiting in the ancestors 'cemetery , he'll die in a foreign land , far from his native home .
is he alive?
i haven't seen any sign of death .
the child's uncle is in belgium?
no , in italy .
go as soon as you can .
tell him to protect the child .
