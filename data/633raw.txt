i can't hold her much longer .
she's taking on too much water .
what is going on back there?
keep your pants on , murphy .
we blew the starboard engine .
port engine's way too hot .
hold on .
shorten the tow or cut her loose .
epps ... ... get off my damn tugboat .
we don't have much time .
move it , epps .
if she sinks , she's taking us with her .
got a punch in the port floater .
five minutes before she floods .
less than that !
get back here .
we're cutting her loose .
cut her loose .
that's it .
get back here .
come on !
you heard the man !
took us three months to get her off the bottom .
i will not lose her now !
goddamn it , epps !
you can't fix everything !
christ !
for the last time , get back here !
she's taking on too much water !
why do you always have to break my balls?
i said get back here !
do you want me to come down there and kick your ass?
because i'll do it .
here's to the best damn salvage crew in the business !
we did it , guys !
yeah , look at that !
all right .
nice work .
here's to the fucking sea !
to the sea .
to a job well done .
mr. murphy?
i'm jack ferriman .
i was wondering if i could buy you a drink .
he doesn't drink .
could i talk to you alone?
you talk to me , you talk to my crew .
that's the way it is .
i fly the arctic weather patrol flights out of mackenzie bay .
last month i was out in the middle of the strait when i came across this .
congratulations .
you found a boat .
in the middle of the ocean , of all places .
i tried for radio contact and got nothing ... ... so i figured she had to be adrift .
in the bering strait?
that's miles from shipping lanes .
did you alert the coast guard?
it's international waters , so they noted it and that's it .
you get a name?
no , i put it out of my head until two days ago when i saw it again .
what are we talking about?
what kind of tonnage?
big .
huge .
could be military .
let's say that we're a little bit interested .
what's in it for you?
i want 20 % finder's fee , whatever she's worth .
have you told anyone else about this?
not a living soul .
give us a minute , will you?
okay .
so?
what do you think , murph?
who knows?
could be full of shit .
i do know one thing .
i've seen strange things happen in the strait .
sea gives you an opportunity , take it .
that's at least a week out of our way .
we've been out for six months already .
i got a fiancee waiting , remember?
i'm getting married in a month .
plan was to go back to anchorage .
starboard diesel needs an overhaul .
there is no plan .
if you don't want to go , that's fine .
let's tell him we'll get somebody else .
wait a minute .
let's not be hasty .
what's a ship like that worth?
who knows?
millions?
thousands?
could be nothing .
depends on a lot of things .
mainly , if we have the right to salvage .
pretty big " if .
what's the split?
we split it even , six ways .
even split?
beats me paying you overtime .
i'm good .
i'm in .
greer?
what do you say?
all right .
hey , ferriman !
can you come over here?
so this is the way it works .
10 % instead of your 20 % finder's fee .
i can't let you take advantage of me like that .
that's the way it is .
take it or leave it .
fine .
but i go with you .
not on my boat , you don't .
think i'd tell you where a fortune might be without insurance?
there are five other boats that would jump at this .
i come with you .
so you take it or leave it .
things are dull !
she'll love it .
what do you think?
too much off the sides , but i can come up with something she'll love .
shave that yourself .
don't want to help me out?
who the fuck are you kidding?
everybody knows you navy boys take it up the ass .
enjoying the ride , jack?
no , sir .
not the same as flying planes over ice sheets , is it?
what's the appeal?
i could ask you the same thing .
what's a nice girl doing in a dump like this instead of raising a family?
i own a third of murphy's operation .
i'm not that nice .
and these monkeys are my family .
santos to murphy .
come in .
yeah?
i think you should get up here .
what is it?
i think you should see this !
it was there a second ago !
ten miles to the northwest .
would you turn off that fucking music?
i'm telling you , there must be a glitch .
i saw it with my own eyes .
glitch , my ass .
there's nothing there .
give me a look at this .
there it is !
right in front of you !
tell me you don't see nothing .
do you see what i'm saying?
do you see what i'm saying to you?
dodge , could you get on the bow light?
all right , murph .
it's there , right?
there's something there .
hey , murph , what's up?
vessel at position 7 5 north ... ... this is arctic warrior .
come in .
this is tugboat arctic warrior .
do you read me?
this is arctic warrior .
do you read me?
come in .
shit !
now do you believe me?
holy shit !
an ocean liner?
where did that come from?
it's the antonia graza .
jesus christ .
this is civilian tugboat arctic warrior .
is there anyone aboard?
this is civilian tugboat arctic warrior .
is there anyone aboard?
this is arctic warrior .
can you read us?
you know her , murphy?
only in my dreams .
christ , she's beautiful .
italian liners couldn't compete for speed , so they built floating art palaces instead .
she was reported missing may 21 , 1962 , off the coast of labrador .
funny thing is , there was no distress signal .
she just disappeared .
ever since , every captain's been looking for her , hoping she hasn't gone down .
do you know what this means?
what?
under the law of the sea , she's ours .
let's not keep a lady waiting .
santos , bring us alongside .
fire up the crane .
we got business to do .
when we get onboard , stay together .
we don't know what kind of shape she's in .
take us up , greer .
aye , aye , captain .
hey , murphy , please remember to keep all channels open .
thank you .
they won't let me go .
safety first .
that's why you go last , jack .
can you sit down?
i'm trying to keep this steady .
i just want ...
sit down !
get out of the way !
okay .
she's had some battering over the last 40 years , you can tell .
stand by .
setting you down topside .
she's still a beaut .
unbelievable .
you better stay alert .
watch your step .
40 years of rust can turn deck plates into quicksand .
we'll make our way in at the fore , then check the bridge .
this way .
careful .
forward mast is history .
epps and murphy , are they a couple?
hell , no .
she's like a daughter to him .
he'd be lost without her .
superstructure's in decent shape .
no sign of damage .
lifeboats are gone , stern to bow .
life preserver lockers are all empty .
sure no survivors ever turned up , murph?
sure as we're walking on the graza , dodge .
this way .
let's go .
jesus .
she's no fiddler's green .
you're wrong , munder .
she's beautiful .
whoever was on here originally sure left in a hurry .
murphy , come in .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome aboard .
i'm julie .
i'll be your hostess this evening .
have some respect , okay?
check out all those champagne bottles .
looks like we missed one hell of a party .
and one hell of a hangover .
shut up !
shut up !
let's find the bridge .
such a manly man .
what?
you all right?
shut up !
come on , mary , let's go .
murph , how many passengers did she carry?
over 600 .
the creme de la creme of society from all over europe .
crew of 500 from italy .
talk to me .
how's everything going?
okay , good .
this companionway should get us to the bridge .
here , epps , hold this .
what's going on?
after you .
no , after you .
no , no .
after me .
tough guy .
don't let go !
pull !
pull !
please , epps !
please , epps , don't let go !
give me your hand .
pull us up !
oh , god !
i told you to watch your fucking step !
oh , shit .
oh , jesus .
from now on , you let me lead .
okay?
let's go .
i think i just shit my pants .
no , you always smell that way .
compass is dead .
helm's not responding , either .
fuel tanks are empty .
she must've rode on full throttle till she was bone dry .
epps !
i'm looking for the ship's log .
let's get this documentation back ...
are you okay?
yeah .
you sure?
yeah .
let's get to it .
hey , check this out .
it's a watch .
congratulations , buddy .
no .
look again , you moron .
it's a digital watch .
do the math .
they didn't have digital watches in 1962 .
so we're not the first people to board this ship .
but she's ours now .
let's get some sleep , tow her at dawn .
let's hope there's no more surprises .
amen to that .
oh , god .
epps , can i get some tea?
any sign of what might've happened?
how she got here?
that's the $64 million question , isn't it?
ever hear of a ship called the marie celeste?
twin masted brigantine out of charleston during the civil war .
she was bound for london with a cargo of cotton .
thanks .
two months after she set sail , she was sighted by fishermen off tripoli .
she was doing 12 knots an hour in a stiff breeze .
something wasn't quite right .
they didn't know what so they went onboard .
you know what they found?
nothing .
no passengers .
no crew .
no captain .
no sign of distress .
59 days after the last log entry , it had traveled 4500 miles across the ocean ... ... past the rock of gibraltar and into the mediterranean sea at full sail .
and nobody at the helm .
what do you make of that?
a ghost ship .
hey , you smell that?
i smell bullshit .
been on the sea a lot longer than you .
i know .
seen things that you can't even imagine .
maritime history is full of marie celestes .
so , what's our plan?
i think we should do what we came to do .
tie her up , tug her in .
you think our little tug will pull this entire ocean liner?
not with the problems we got .
we could set her at anchor and come back with two or three tugs .
no , some russian trawler will come along .
i've already looked for her anchors , anyway .
they're gone .
what do you think?
get the engines working ... ... it could take us two weeks minimum to tow a vessel this size .
for my share of what she's worth , i'd drag her back to anchorage myself .
don't let go !
help me !
don't let go !
thought you might want a jacket .
thanks .
boy , do i miss that .
you okay?
you seem quiet since you came back .
i think i saw something i couldn't possibly have seen .
like what?
no , it's crazy .
i'm curious .
tell me .
i think i saw a little girl .
on ...
on the ...
the boat?
yeah .
looking right at me .
and then what happened?
nothing .
she disappeared .
sometimes , when i'd be flying for hours on end ... ... i'd think i'd see stuff too .
it'd be there one second and gone the next .
like a dream .
thanks .
see you in the a . m .
okay .
good night .
see you tomorrow .
yeah .
she's got a big hole .
she's sinking .
this is where the damage is .
see?
breach in the hull , about 10 by 20 ... ... torn to the port collision bulkhead .
did it hit an iceberg?
no , you don't need an iceberg to rupture a hull .
she's been hit recently .
about a week ago , i'd say .
this is where we are .
the problem's this group of islands .
nothing spectacular ... ... just rocks , a couple thousand seals .
the antonia graza's caught here in this strong current loop ... ... and slowly she's been pushed towards those rocks .
last time she hit them .
what about next time?
won't be one .
we've got three days to fix it .
that's if the weather holds .
why can't we tow it like it is?
it'd be like towing a car with four flat tires .
it's a bump in the road .
we can fix it .
murph , bump in the road?
the breach we can probably patch if we can get to the inside .
we'll weld shut the flooded compartments , pump out the water up to the aft peak .
on top of that , the rudder's jammed .
we jerry rig it , set a 38 degree current drift to clear the island chain .
what does all that mean?
i just ...
that's a lot of work for three days .
but with the gear we've got onboard and what's on that ship , we can try .
we can do it , right?
with the gear we've got onboard , i can't fix our engine .
quit bitching and overhaul the starboard engine .
so that's the plan?
just do it .
i'll call it in .
i wouldn't do that if i were you .
maritime law states ...
i know .
we just don't want any unexpected guests .
just leave it .
your call , captain .
all right , you know the drill .
we do a complete recon .
make sure we've got no problems before we get to work .
stay with me , greer .
don't wander .
okay .
dodge , munder , go to the port collision bulkhead .
jack and i'll work back from the fore .
call if you need anything .
how about a pizza?
you're so funny .
the only plan in this business is that there is no plan .
what is that?
what these people talking crazy for?
that's not even good english .
hang in there , okay , preciosa?
because someday he'll find some other genius to fix his boat .
you want to play like that?
it's still sweet , though .
light coming up .
you were right .
she is beautiful .
she sure is .
epps , we're heading for the main engine room .
epps?
all right , capitano .
oh , shit .
we're gonna have to dive to get to that tear .
epps , the engine room is totally flooded .
epps , can you hear me?
wait !
what happened?
you okay?
what are you doing down there?
did you hurt yourself?
what are you doing?
the whole bottom's riddled with them .
looks like someone used it for target practice .
that's the happy version .
what's the not so happy version?
there were people in there .
i saw that little girl again .
what?
where?
i must be losing my goddamn mind .
well , did she say anything?
forget it .
come on .
murphy , come in .
dodge !
anybody !
shit .
i think she's fucking with us .
looks like central laundry .
this vent connects to the forward hold .
we need to see if it's flooded .
i may need help shutting it .
you sure we need to ...?
murphy , where the hell are you?
how long have they been here?
a month , maybe less .
what are we gonna do?
get off this boat !
but the ship ...
lf it sinks , it sinks .
you're right .
stinks .
what the hell?
we came through there .
no shit !
come on !
this way .
come on , jack .
what the ...?
when'd you start wearing lipstick , epps?
epps?
francesca .
nice titties .
not that you can hold a candle to the future mrs. greer , though .
come on , jack .
stop dragging ass !
what's your problem?
what's this?
forget it .
let's go !
jack !
'58 jaguar x150 .
i've dreamt about this car since i was a kid .
we have to get out of here now .
do you understand?
now .
there's something moving in there .
fuck !
oh , my god !
i hate rats !
what?
oh , my god !
look at this !
i have to get murphy .
murphy !
is someone trying to call me?
dodge !
munder !
maureen ...
who's maureen?
it's my first name .
it's cold ...
he said " cold "?
the galley .
it's cold .
please help us .
don't go in there .
you fucking assholes !
fuck you !
take it easy !
you were fucking with us .
we fucked with you .
why aren't you laughing?
wanna hear something funnier?
we found dead guys in the laundry room .
and this in the cargo hold .
need some help , skipper?
i'm sorry .
jesus .
oh , man .
holy shit !
yeah !
we're rich !
you son of a bitch !
rich !
come on .
let's go .
move this shit out !
one .
two .
three ...
how much you figure it's worth , boss?
there's a lot of gold .
hard to know .
two , 300 million , maybe .
maybe more .
jesus .
i don't know .
lock boxes with half of fort knox in them?
they gotta be insured .
no way somebody will let this much gold float away .
well , the markings have been filed down .
what does that mean?
someone didn't want this traceable .
it's stolen .
it may have to do with the reason this ship disappeared when it did .
wait .
if the gold's got something to do with 1962 ... ... what about the bodies?
they can't be more than three weeks old .
somebody's gotta say it , and it might as well be me .
this ship is fucked up .
earlier i could swear i heard a woman singing .
it's like she was ...
like she was coming on to me .
oh , no !
