lost portman on comm ... and all i've got on destroyer is a wall .
portman , come in .
destroyer .
come in .
this is corporal dean portman ... with rrts 6 special ops on olduvai , 0310 hours .
we have encountered hostile activity .
i repeat , require immediate rrts reinforcements .
destroyer , portman , where the hell are you?
shit .
shit .
0h , god !
jesus !
hmm .
pinky , you got portman?
no .
holy shit .
he's gone .
destroyer?
and portman .
what the fuck happened , man?
i got him , i got him .
destroyer , i got you , man .
what's up , man?
what the hell is this?
and whose goddamn blood is on that window?
goat's .
he killed himself .
what do you mean , he killed himself?
he was already dead .
it's true .
it's goat .
he was changing into one of these motherfuckers and he killed himself .
we found two more scientists at the dig .
thurman and a balding guy with glasses .
dr. clay .
did you check their necks?
were there open wounds on their necks?
we were conducting a firefight , not an autopsy .
we came up here to find six scientists .
four are known dead ... and dr. willits is probably kla somewhere down in that sewer .
the only one missing is dr. carmack .
has dr. carmack showed up yet?
oh , he's shown up all right .
look at the left ear .
son of a bitch .
i think this other one is steve willits .
i'm going to run the dna , check it against his med records .
what are you people working on up here?
we're analyzing bones , artifacts .
we're not doing anything like this .
then what the fuck is that?
it must be a genetic mutation , something environmental or viral .
i don't know .
it may even be reversible .
it's irreversible .
not necessarily .
dr. carmack's condition ... is irreversible ... [ grunting ]
no !
because carmack's condition is that ... he's dead .
kid , you and duke ... get back to the dig and you make sure those other dead scientists ... are really dead .
i've lost ... four soldiers .
what are you people experimenting with up here?
i'm not gonna ask you again .
i told you , it's an archeological research center .
do you think i'm lying to you?
is that what you're saying?
you think i'm hiding something?
i'm telling the truth .
what were you downloading?
what were you sent to protect?
the research data .
research into what?
subject was injected with study agent at 00 : 03 .
vitals normal , elevated heart rate attributable to subject anxiety .
c 24 successfully grafted to subject's marker cells at 00 : 09 .
he reconstructed chromosome mutation on a human subject .
we were never gonna do human studies .
what the hell are we looking at?
genesis , chapter 1 .
subject moved to protected observation area at 00 : 17 .
curtis stahl .
multiple murder .
condemned to execution .
chromosome 24 .
oh , my god .
49 minutes after injection , genetic mutations ... began to visually manifest on subject's extremities .
this is what you're here to protect .
it doesn't make any sense .
you trusted them .
they lied to you .
they used you , sam .
if he perfected xenogenesis ...
christ , don't you get it?
it's this place .
it's hell .
it always was .
this shit ends here .
what are you doing?
we need to destroy these discs .
that's uac property .
fuck uac , we take this back , they'll just ...
we take the data back .
sarge , do you not see what's going on here?
i didn't see shit .
and i ain't paid to see shit .
i have my orders .
and so do you .
is this everything?
i said , is this everything?
i , uh , have three more to download .
then do it .
sarge?
we got a problem .
0ne dead scientist is missing .
now .
you just wanna leave her here?
she's got a job to do .
look , this is portman's comm .
you call if you need help , okay?
you gonna be all right?
i'll be fine .
okay .
i'll see you soon .
pinky , are you there?
pinky .
sarge?
something is cutting through the ark door .
you have a visual?
0h , i got a visual all right .
don't let it get to the ark !
five .
pinky , use the grenade !
four .
use the goddamn grenade !
three , two .
throw it !
0ne .
pinky's gone .
that fucker ran .
shit .
it got through .
what the hell is that?
system reboot .
five minutes .
quarantine cordon is breached .
this mission is no longer containment .
get all the weapons and ammo you can .
we're going through .
move !
sam , come in .
over .
sam , do you read me?
over .
come in !
she's not answering .
time required to begin renewed operation ... four minutes and 45 seconds .
you got three .
sam !
come in , sam !
sam !
sam , why didn't you answer your comm?
we gotta go now !
why did they take goat and not destroyer?
why carmack and not dr. thurman?
what?
lucy had the 24th chromosome ... but she wasn't a monster .
she died protecting her child , not devouring it .
why did the same chromosome that made her superhuman ... turn stahl into a monster?
let's go .
just give me a minute .
we don't have a minute .
then give me 10 seconds .
this is its tongue .
this is brain matter from portman .
this is from destroyer .
it's choosing , john .
it's choosing who to infect .
it's choosing?
how is it choosing?
there are genetic markers for psychotic and violent behavior .
it could be a specific neurotransmitter ... it's picking up on , a ganglion .
latching onto numbers in the dna code linked to ...
linked to what?
evil?
ten percent of the human genome is still unmapped .
some say it's the genetic blueprint for the soul .
maybe c 24 is what destroyed the population .
it would explain why some of them had to build the ark ... to escape to a new beginning .
some it made superhuman .
others , monsters .
oh , my god .
we gotta get out of here now .
what?
come on , let's go , come on .
the people quarantined on the other side of the ark ... they won't all be infected !
what's going on?
sarge is going to kill them all .
come on .
we uphold quarantine .
nothing gets to the elevator back on earth .
we can't let them get to the surface .
if it breathes , kill it .
five ... four , three ... two , one .
ark travel complete .
this is corporal dean portman ... with rrts 6 special 0ps on 0lduvai , 0310 hours .
we have encountered hostile activity .
require immediate rrts reinforcements .
yeah , no shit .
we got 58 minutes before the auto lockdown is lifted .
reset it for another six hours .
i can't .
it's been disabled .
same as the topside comm link .
they're disabling computers now?
yeah , they're rocket scientists , remember?
ark travel complete .
oh , my god .
sarge , what's your position?
sarge .
sarge , come in .
do you copy?
come in , sarge .
do you read me?
over .
sarge , come in , do you copy?
loud and clear .
look , do not kill everybody .
i repeat , do not kill everybody .
help me .
they're not all infected .
help me , help me , please .
do you copy?
copy that .
help me .
clear the rest of this sector and meet back at the ark chamber .
jesus christ , what the hell are ...
who the hell's in there?
well , don't just stand there , you dumb son of a bitch .
help me up .
it's okay .
please ... help us .
you don't have to kill all of them .
i don't think everyone is infected , or even capable of being infected .
we have orders to contain this threat by any means necessary .
so let's evacuate the uninfected ... and blow this place to hell .
and we have orders to protect this facility .
we don't have orders to kill innocent people .
found this little chicken shit hiding under a pile of dead bodies .
am i glad to see you guys .
that thing cut right through the door .
i tried to use the grenade but it came at me too fast .
followed me through the ark and started to kill everybody .
it was horrible .
there's no wound on his neck .
he's clean .
i say who's clean ... and who's not .
i mean , it wasn't my fault .
hey , i'm not a soldier .
you shouldn't have left me ... sarge .
there's a storeroom to the south .
it's got , like , 20 people holed up inside of it .
we gotta do something .
your orders were to clear that sector .
is it cleared?
no , i told them to stay put .
they're okay .
they're just scared shitless .
we kill them all .
let god sort them out .
this is wrong .
i think ...
son , you don't think .
that's an order .
we're in the field , soldier .
sarge , if nothing's found them ...
you will obey the direct order ... of your commanding officer .
no .
now .
go to hell .
no !
no .
holy shit .
mutinous insurrection is punishable ... by death .
it was his first mission !
and it's not gonna be my last .
i need soldiers .
i don't need anybody else but soldiers .
drop the weapons .
i mean it .
i have no intention of being killed by a madman .
drop the weapons .
ah , there's something behind me , isn't there?
on me .
get sam .
wait here .
listen .
withdraw !
withdraw behind the nanowall .
move !
i can't see .
i can't see .
move .
clear !
fuck !
the wall's not closing !
i'm not supposed to die .
let's go .
come on .
clear .
how long before they get through?
not long .
you've been hit .
oh , john .
listen to me , sam .
you're cold .
shivering .
it's important .
this is an st grenade .
when they come through ... you pop the top and hit the button .
john , stay with me .
stay awake .
john , stay with me , please .
what's that?
it's c 24 .
it's from carmack's lab .
no .
it could save you .
no way , forget it .
you're bleeding to death .
no way , sam .
i've done some bad things .
i know you .
you don't know me .
you don't know .
you're my brother .
i know you .
wait .
wait .
if i should turn into one of those demons .
one through the heart , one through the head ... don't you hesitate .
okay?
i won't need to .
i know you .
you're my brother .
sam?
sam .
sam .
sam .
john .
sam .
sam .
sam .
you're alive .
shh .
don't talk .
last man standing , reaper .
i think she needs medical attention .
can you get to the elevator?
i'm not sure .
try .
where are the survivors kid found?
i took care of that problem .
quarantine's almost over .
power should be back on any minute .
you killed the kid .
we're all killers , reaper .
it's what they pay us for .
quarantine complete .
elevators back on line .
it's finished .
what do you say we go outside and get some fresh air?
are you gonna shoot me?
yeah , i was thinking about it .
what you got left?
half a clip .
