23 . 976
good morning , tom .
twelve is our number .
it's the number of games my husband tom coaches at lincoln college every season .
it's the number of times we zero out our bank account each year to make ends meet .
and it's the number ofkids we try to keep track of .
hey .
good run?
oh , yeah .
you need a paramedic?
no, just a pair of knees .
you finish?
still proofing , but i'm sending it to diane today .
look at this .
new , clean cover ... no peanut butter stains ... yet .
hey , baby?
baby?
you know , on the run , you know what i was thinking?
what?
well , we've been married , what , five years?
twenty three .
twenty three .
sorry .
and i think we could use a little change around here ...
like like this lumpy old mattress .
maybe we should just , you know , get rid of it .
don't be ridiculous , honey .
you know you can just pound the lumps out of a mattress .
what what do you mean?
you can just pound the lumps out of a mattress?
yeah, just randomly start swatting away .
and it goes flat?
yes , yes .
just start you just randomly start swatting
careful .
i got a dog on me !
twelve's an insane number ofkids ... but having a small family was never an option for us .
see , tom loved growing up with seven brothers and sisters .
and after my sister died , i spent most of my time ... wishing i had seven brothers and sisters .
tom and i met at illinois polytechnic university .
he was a senior dreaming ofbecoming the head football coach there .
i was a freshman dreaming ofbecoming a sports reporter .
he wanted eight kids , i wanted eight kids .
bam .
an hour after i met him , i knew he was the one .
wejust had family at the wedding .
oh , and shake maguire , tom's best man .
what a hot dog .
ayear later , we had our first nora .
i loved taking her to work with me .
after charlie and lorraine were born , we realized our dream ofliving in the city ...
and having eight kids and two careers wasn't gonna work .
as much as we wanted our big careers , we wanted our big family more .
so tom settled for a division ill coaching job at lincoln ...
i quit writing for the tribune , and we moved to the country .
tom and i got busy when we moved to midland .
we had henry , sarah, jake and mark in consecutive years .
then we went for magic number eight , and instead ... we got the first set of fraternal twins jessica and kim .
nine kids .
come on , you guys .
come on .
wave !
hi !
with each child , tom and i got further from our big career dreams .
but we didn't think about that .
yeah !
oh .
sorry , coach .
we had our hands full with nine .
we were happy , and we were done .
then we went to a party celebrating shake maguire's appointment ... to athletic director at our alma mater .
and , well , too many beers and nine months later , we had mike .
after that , tom got a vasectomy .
but he didn't hear the doctor say that it would be a few weeks ... before the procedure became effective .
in '98 , nigel and kyle got us to that crazy number 1 2 .
but by then , tom and i were experts at managing chaos .
let's move , gang .
come on , come on , come on !
woo , woo , woo , woo , woo !
charlie missed his curfew again last night .
take care of that .
hey .
you can only put on so much lip gloss , princess !
you blew my concentration !
temper , sarah .
now i get to start all over again .
wrap it up , lorraine !
okay , daddy . !
have you seen my frog , dad?
sorry , charlie .
uh , nigel .
kyle .
it's mark .
i knew that .
hey , teenager .
you got caught on mom radar last night .
you're not gonna get that scholarship if you're out late with beth ... the night before a big game .
well , i'm not so sure i even want to go to college .
since when?
since beth's mom offered me a job at the auto shop .
hmm .
sounds exciting .
well , we'll talk about that after you get your full ride .
and , meanwhile , in by 1 0 : 00 on school nights .
clear?
got it .
anything else you wanna talk about?
did i mention i don't like you very much?
yeah , you mentioned that .
then i'm good .
okay , me too .
dude , two words : need new skates .
dude , three words : paper route .
hi .
can't make dinner .
hank and i are moving into our new apartment .
love , nora .
have you seen beans , mom?
mm mm .
here you go , gunner .
you hungry , boy?
here you go , gunner .
are you hungry?
look , i am totally aware that this family doesn't value ... self presentation in the same obsessive way that i do .
fine .
whatever .
but one of my life goals ... aside from being , like , a fashion guru ... is to indicate to the local community that ... the baker family actually owns a bar of soap .
so , as self appointed in house rep of style and hygiene ...
i think i should be allotted at least five extra minutes in front of the mirror .
three .
done .
now help your sister butter the toast .
sarah , your suspension from lacrosse for excessive force has been lifted .
so you're going today .
henry , you have band practice , all right?
i cleaned your clarinet .
please don't play with food in your mouth again .
kim and jessica , your teacher called and has made a request ... that you do not correct her in front of the class .
mike, you have show and tell today .
and , please , honey ... remember that body parts do not count .
kyle and nigel , you have a dentist's appointment at 3 : 00 .
you're goin 'to work with dad .
yeah !
and we're shooting our christmas card today .
what time's nora coming over?
uh , she may not make it .
she hardly ever comes home since she started dating that doorknob .
he's not a doorknob .
the man irons his jeans , mom .
yeah , that's weird .
never mind .
i'll shoot it without her .
i'll photoshop her in .
honey , could you take 1 0 pounds off me with that photoshop thing?
can i be photoshopped in?
wait .
if sarah's bein 'photoshopped in ...
then i'm definitely gonna get photoshopped in .
why don't we all be
nobody gets photoshopped in but nora .
everybody be here by 4 : 00 .
why do we always do our christmas cards in may anyway?
because the earlier we get it done , the bigger discount we get at the printer .

honey , she's just trying to have her own life .
she's too young to have her own life .
she's 22 .
the same age i was when i was pregnant with her .
five minutes ago , she was sitting on my shoulders ... pointing at cows in munger's field .
and then you blinked .
yeah .

that coach was 5 3 .
that's doesn't cut it .
i'm trying to grow a program .
hey , guys .
remember shake?
we played college ball together .
yeah , the hot dog .
mom said it first .
we're having adult time here , boys .
no idea what that means .
well , it's this crazy thing where grown ups ... actually get to have a conversation without being interrupted by kids .
sounds wicked boring .
it is .
so why don't you run along?
mom's right .
he is a wiener .
sorry about that .
kate likes you .
it's just that, you know ... she had to have the biggest stud on the team .
so she , uh , chose the third string receiver ... and got all this .
yeah .
so , are you gonna tell me why you're here?
lincoln's a winning machine .
you think you can make our old team a champion again?
you mean coach?
coach .
tom , what is it?
just tell me .
just  okay .
wait .
dad's covering with the machines .
to the chute !
go , go , go !
my , this is big .
shake maguire wants me to coach the stallions .
get out !
he offered me ... a fat five year contract , housing allowance , moving expenses .
kate , we can finally get new furniture .
we can get a new car .
and get this .
university employees can send their kids to school for free .
wow .
oh .
i don't know , honey .
a division i coaching job ... that's a lot of pressure and a lot more hours .
yeah , but with all the kids in school next year , we could handle more job pressure .
yeah , but , honey , midland is our home .
i mean , the kids 'lives are here .
midland has been great for raising our kids ... but i never expected 'em to sacrifice the way that i did .
you loved your childhood .
yeah .
except for this part the raggedy , hand me down part .
the stallions head coach .
it's your dream job , isn't it , honey?
i want this one , kate .
let's talk to the kids .
how do you think they'll handle it?
we're gonna move !
okay , everybody , you know the drill .
on " three , " you give me a big " cheese .
jake , do you have to wear black?
black works , mom . jesus , like , has his funeral on christmas .
he died on easter , barbie .
whatever .
he was resurrected on easter , moron .
be quiet .
don't touch me . !
hey , hey , hey !
what's all the fighting about?
exactly when did you plan on telling us about moving?
i'm not moving !
yeah , because i'm not moving , all right?
i'm not moving .
charlie , evanston is only four hours away .
beth can come and visit .
this isn't just about beth , mom .
my whole life is here at midland .
hello?
hi , mom .
hi , nora .
you're on speaker .
hi , everybody .
hank says hi too .
so , you guys are thinking about moving up here?
yeah .
you got room in that new apartment for your big old family?
just big enough for two , dad .
how's your book going , mom?
actually , i just sent it to a friend who's in publishing , so we'll see .
could we stay on subject , please?
beans's mother's buried here .
i'm not splitting them up .
they're family .
we can build a fancy new memorial to pork in our new yard .
yeah , like we could afford that .
actually , we can .
i'll be making enough money to do that , get you out of hand me downs ... getjake those new skates , and get that new car we've been saving for .
but i have friends here !
honey , you'll keep in touch .
and you can make new friends .
quiet !
now , look , i know you're all scared .
moving is a big deal .
we're very comfortable here .
i get that .
and that's why i turned down a lot of other coaching offers through the years .
but this is a job i wanted since we left chicago .
and , in fact , it's more than a job to me .
um , this is my team ... and it's my colors and it's , um ... the stallions .
and they're finally calling my number .
and i want you to take this risk with me , because if you do ...
i promise you , we will be ... a happier and stronger family .
you promise?
i promise .
i would feel happier and stronger if we vote on it .
yeah , definitely .
we should vote .
that's the only way to make it fair .
it's the only way to do it .
all right , we can vote .
but in the end , your mother and i are gonna do what we think is best for the family .
what's the point of even voting?
i'm out .
let's get out of here .
it's not even worth it .
come on , guys .
hello?
still here .
all right , eight noes ... three yes's and three maybes .
not exactly a mandate .
give me a pen .
i'm gonna change some of these .
here we go .

so we're doing this .
we're gonna do this .
we're doing it .

up till now , i've been , like , mellow ... about this whole having it all lifestyle that you and mom are currently into ...
a , " because sarah has the drama queen role totally covered ... and " b , " because i've benefited from your salary spike ... in various shallow but nonetheless pleasing ways .
but , dad , check it out .
this afternoon , mike was repelling from the roof ...
nigel was using kim as a human dartboard ... and you employed your son as a vomit mop .
call me crazy , pops , but things are getting pretty twisted around here .
i need to hire some help .
as in a babysitter?
okay , that is so not happening .
dad, just call mom and tell her we need her back home .
i just can't do that right now , not with all the work she's done .
it just wouldn't be fair .
well , then why don't you spend more time at home?
honey , that's just not an option right now .
i've got a big job , a job that i love .
i'm gonna have to call in some backup .
hello .
uh , my name is tom baker , and i'm interested in hiring a domestic helper .
um , i have 1 2 children .

there's only two .
oh , plus 1 0 .
how many kids?
well , uh , when you get here we can just count 'em up .
well , there's 1 2 .
but one doesn't live with me ... and one you never see 'cause he's so mad .

hey , you know what?
there was a pep rally at school today .
there were 20, 000 people in the stands , and i just couldn't leave .
here .

i'm sorry .
i had to
i know you have responsibilities at home , bake , but this is it .
this is your shot , your moment , not theirs .
what's the matter with you?
what are you doing?
you've wanted this for as long as i've known you .
i just don't want to see you blow it .
i'll work something out .
it's hard to believe someone as staggeringly beautiful as you ... could deliver 1 2 children and still look as yummy as you do .
oh , that's so sweet .
i guess the camera can't see my hips .
tell us , did you have them conventionally?
well , uh , after the sixth one , they just kind of walked out .
why don't you read us a little something from your book?
oh , i don't know .
no .
people can just buy it and then read it .
oh , come on .
the audience wants it .
oh , all right .
okay .
some , uh , call me a mom .
others call me a primary caregiver .
but they both mean the same thing : chauffeur .
you know , it sounds like you and your husband have things under control at home .
oh , well , i'm lucky to have him .
we sure do .
kids , on the carpet !
now !
dad !
college guys?
what's goin 'on here?
where's charlie?
he went to midland for the day .
midland?
it's a school day .
he hates school .
'course you couldn't know that 'cause you're never home .
well , that is about to change , sarah baker .
because since i can't go to work without you guys getting in trouble ... and since i can't stay home without shake bugging me ...
i have brought my work home with me .

i heard you were dissing my family .
i don't even know your family , loser .

coach , give us a quote .
violence begets violence .
all right , enough is enough .
you're slacking on your chores .
you're fighting at school .
things are out of control .
as of this moment , you are all grounded .
what's " grounded "?
" what's grounded?
i'll tell you what grounded is .
except for attending games ... you go to school ; you come home from school ; you do your homework ; you do your chores ; you go to bed ; and that's it .
but that  oh , yes , sarah , i know .
that sucks .
but that's the way it is .
does this mean we can't go to dylan's birthday party?
that's exactly what it means .
we bought his presents already .

you are not dropping out of school , and you are not walking out on this family .
what family?
since we moved here , everybody's been looking out for number one , especially you and mom .
your mother and i are doing what we think is best for everyone .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
you did not take this coaching job for us .
you took this because you were a loser in college while shake was being a superstar .
if you want your shot at glory , if you wanna have it all , you do what you gotta do .
but quit feeding us this line about being a happier and stronger family .
this move was about you !
and you know what?
i don't have to sit here and pay the price for your life choices .
i'm leaving .
you're staying .
are you gonna make me?
charlie , i love you .
i want you to have the best life you can have .
and that means you're getting a diploma .

tom .
tom , we need a minute .
please don't die , beans .
the university is prepared to make an investment in the program ... but we want some assurances .
what does that mean?
we wanna know you're committed to the football program .
you have to decide who's making the bacon and who's cooking it .
so what's it gonna be , tom?
tom , didn't you pick up my dry cleaning?
yes , dear .
it's in the front closet .

i can't believe it .
what can i say?
you didn't pick the perfect moment to have a career .

i know it's been a difficult day ... but i need all of you , and i would appreciate it if you could just put on happy faces .
everything's great .

i know .
i'm sorry .
mom . !
oh , honey !
oh !
oh , we missed you , sweetheart .
do that again , i'm going to have to pound you .
but i thought i was fedex .
your eccentricities and vision problems ... are genetic traits that could be attributed to any number of the baker ancestors .
yeah .
without you , we wouldn't be the 1 2 bakers anymore .
we'd be , like , 1 1 .
i figured everybody hated me like sarah and lorraine hate each other .
there are times when i want to kill sarah ... but i'd kill for her all the time .
come here , cutie .
tom?
you wanna say something?
a few words?
sure .
beans was a good frog .
he was , uh , not like a lot of the bad frogs ... you hear about today , all hopped up .
he was lovable .
he was almost human .
he was like , uh , one of the family .
except that , of course , he was green and he ate flies .
but he was a hopper .
he hipped and he hopped .
he loved hip hop .
mark , why don't you i think you should say something .
for a long time , you were the only person i could talk to .
that's different now .
but you're the one who got me through .
thanks .
i'm resigning after the season , shake .
giving up the dream , huh?
just going with a different one .
no regrets?
if i screw up raising my kids ... nothing i achieve will matter much .
thank you .
we'll make an announcement at the end of the week .
come on .
keep the assembly line up here .
we gotta get this done .
where's dad?
he went to the game .
why didn't he ask us to go?
because ... he didn't want you to be there on the day that he quits his job .
he's quitting his job?
mm hmm .
what would we have to do so he wouldn't quit?
i'll give up clarinet lessons .
i'll go back to hand me downs .
okay , ease up .
everybody listen .
dad's a big boy , and he makes his own decisions ... and he's doing this because it's what he wants .
in that case , i totally take back what i said about the hand me downs .
i thought so .
anybody else wanna take back their offer?
yeah , there we go .
i guess you could say that when tom and i left midland ... we had a mess of theories about how to raise children .
we still have a mess of children , but no theories .
sure , 1 2 is still our number .
it's the number of months my book was on the best seller list .
it's the number ofjob offers tom turned down before we found one close to home .
hike !
and each day , it's the number of times i'm thankful there's such a thing as family .
what happened to you?
oh , my god !
save the eggs !
yeah , you got room for all your big old family in that new apartment?
you're on camera , steve .
sorry .
i am .
you idiot .
yeah , you got room in your new apartment for that
battle ax of a wife of mine?

two times?
two times .

on your mark , get set , go . !
i don't wanna move !

frankly , i'm concerned .
i go around those kids , they start beatin 'on me .
what if i get a black eye?

the kids set me on fire , they beat me .
they're abusive .
this is how i get jobs , right here !
i'm sorry .
i looked at myself in the camera .
i'm so good looking .
they set me on fire !

together , maybe .
