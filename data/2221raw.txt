doctor , come quick !
he's coming out of it
there's a world in my head an unreal world
in it , loic loves me and protects me
in it , he's always at my side
now i know it doesn't exist that it was an illusion the fruit of my imagination
we all dream of a great love affair
i just dreamt a bit harder
i'm happy for you
you've worked hard all these years
we'll all miss you here
but i'm glad you're being released
if you keep taking your medication you'll be fine
i wish you good luck
though my love is insane my reason calms the pain in my heart
it tells me to be patient and keep hoping ...
