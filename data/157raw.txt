the u. s. military presence abroad was rocked today when a bomb exploded
in the army barracks in dhahran , saudi arabia .
a multinational force
ripped the front offthe 8 story military dorm , exposingjust how vulnerable u. s. troops are here .
and marines on duty seem , for the most part , numbed by the horror ofthe morning bombing .
early indications suggest this to be the work ofsheikahmed bin talal , a radical fundamentalist cleric known to have issued
the explosion appears to be the work ofterrorists .
and ifthat is the case ,
like all americans , i am outraged by it .
the cowards who committed this murderous act must not go unpunished .
sand leader , this is eagle eye .
we have a fix on the package .
it is in a mercedes sedan traveling south
com sat 1 , your coordinates are as follows .
1 8 0 5 0 .
package is approaching target area .
estimated time ofcontact is approximately 1 4 seconds .
yallah !
yallah !
let me say again .
america takes care ofour own .
those who did it must not go unpunished .
eagle eye , this is sand leader .
the sheik is in our custody .
he is alive and well , and will be delivered intact by 0800 tomorrow .
fbl .
good morning .
fbl .
yes .
good morning , sir .
fbl .
counter terrorism task force .
that was nypd .
brooklyn south issued a code blue
less than 2 minutes ago , and they think hostages are involved .
business or residence?
a bus .
wejust got word there's some kind ofbomb on the bus .
haveyou set up a perimeter?
working on it .
okay .
what about negotiators?
we got our people on the way?
got it .
and what about the bomb squad?
they're going in now .
how soon can we get there?
this time ofday?
maybe tomorrow .
oh , fuck .
open the door !
what?
and nobody's hurt?
this is our first and last warning .
we expect our demands to be met .
there will be no negotiation .
no more communication ofany kind .
that is all .
demand forwhat?
you hear any demand?
maybe it's a prank .
some sense ofhumor .
here's what i know .
b. p. , as in blue paint .
voice altering technology .
what doyou think?
available from the sharperlmage catalog .
last i looked , they didn't have an exploding paint bomb .
still , the rhetoric sounds political .
you think it's militia?
no , not their style .
frank?
islamicjihad aren't known for their sense ofhumor , and hamas is raising so much money here .
why queer their deal?
isn't green the color oflslam , not blue?
another good point .
tina , rub these good points together .
come up with a composite ofthe suspects by the end ofbusiness today .
anita !
yeah?
run that against the mainframe for me , okay?
mike , lab analysis on the paint .
report's not in yet , but we're checking to see ifany blue paint was sold in quantity .
good .
danny , how are the interviews going with the victims?
not great .
check the bus stops .
maybe somebody saw him get on .
hub , i thinkwe're all eager to give up ourweekends on this .
itjust occurs to me
has anyone committed a crime here?
i mean assault with a deadly color?
here's what i don't like .
they know explosives .
that's not such a big deal .
everybody on the internet knows explosives , but they know our response time .
they put in a call , and then theywalk .
i don't like that .
excuse me , sir .
i thinkyou should see this .
itjust came in on the fax . " release him .
release who?
who do we got?
bill clinton?
he didn't do it .
charlie manson?
hamas guy was let go in april .
under protest .
yeah , but why be so coy about it?
you think it's a phony?
it's floyd rose .
somebody's flashing a government badge at the warehouse where they're working on the bus .
our tech guys want to know ifwe're cooperating with any other agencies .
she's looking for the wiring signatures for the device and asking for copies ofany fingerprints we've managed to lift .
she cla?
smells like it .
turns out she's also been talking to some ofthe passengers .

tina .
we pulled his landing card and his i 94 , so now we know he came in 3 days ago out of frankfurt .

we need all known associations , and most ofall , we need an address .
here's the kicker , guys
ali waziri was on the terrorist watch list .
how'd he get into the country?
here it is .
student visa . j one .

in august , he went to lebanon where he was extracted .

extracted bywhom?
i see .
his name's sheikahmed bin talal .
he's iraqi .
he's something ofa religious leader .
with something of a devoted following?
hmm .
okay , i can understand .
whywe wouldn't want to advertise the fact that , uh , our government's in the kidnapping business , but why not let us know?
well , he's still being debriefed .
they don't want to go public with the charges .
what about his followers?
well , clearly they're committed .
meaning?
in this game , the most committed wins .
hub .
excuse me .
hub .
excuse me .
we made the guy in the picture .
my people .
the last of the unambivalent smokers .
his name is samir nazhde .
he teaches arab studies at brooklyn college .
he's the one who sponsored ali waziri's student visa .
and dig this
his brother blew up a movie theater in tel aviv .
you might consider leaving him alone .
whywould we consider that?
well , you can play him like a cop and haul him in now and getyour arrest , oryou can tag him ,
let him lead you to the really big fish .
you're fishing , and he's getting visas for bombers .
you ever heard of catch and release?
mm hmm .

some people are watching .
hey , danny , find me ajudge who'll play ball with me this time and set up a polygraph for samir .
you know , i still don't understand whywe're tipping our hand with him .

yeah , what's there to tip?
protecting your asset , aren'tyou?
aren'tyou?
he's your asset , he's yourjoe , he's working foryou , you're his case officer , right?
uh , sometimes , in addition to being a nationality , being a palestinian is a profession , a very lucrative one .
meaning he's yourjoe , right?
mine , yours , the israelis , the saudis .
one time or another , everybody in the middle east is sleeping with everybody else .
soyou're saying you sleep around .
only professionally .
so we share .
no .
no?
call i. n. s. , check samir's status , start deportation procedures .
i can't letyou do that .
oh , you can't let me do that .
what precisely is your involvement with these people , elise?
samir has been a very important project ofmine for some time .
i'm the only one he'll deal with .
he's verywell connected and extremely high strung .
call i. n. s. , frank .
how easy is it to get inside , frank?
how good areyour sources in the community?
how many people you got in hamas?
huh?
no surveillance .
i've seen your deft touch .
daily reports , we tap his phone .
i see the transcripts .
no problem .
and i run him .
we share him .
no .
he can't know we're talking .
i won't tell him .
and no poly?
never .
done .
all right , let him fly , frank , but i want to see some food on my plate , you understand me?
any more surprises for me , elise?
not tonight .
i'm gonna get some sleep .
you let him hit me !
how can you let them hit me?
well , next time , don't be such a smart ass .
hey , don't tell me what i have to do .
do we really have to have this conversation again?
do we?
i need you to help me .
i need you to be strong ,
likeyou've always been strong , for both ofus .
samir , look at me .
look at me .
go .
yeah , frank?
you know , some peoplejust cannot live in the camps .
for my brother , it was already like dying .
the only thing he lives for is movies .
and then some sheik came and tell him that ...
to die forallah is beautiful .
and ifhe does this thing , our parents will be taken care of , and he will live on in paradise with 70 virgins .
i mean ...
70 .
and my brother , he need to believe it very much .
so he straps 1 0 sticks ofdynamite to his chest .
and he went to the movie .
and then i become a v. i. p.
it's very confusing .
so who areyou afraid ofbetraying?
we know these people .
they bomb , they maim .
they represent the palestine you want to build?
they're using you .
you are using me , too .
everybody uses the palestinians .
hey .
you make reports about our little talks?
and what about fucking me?
i had to get special permission for that .
beats the shit out ofcable .
he asked to wait inside .
good morning .
bill devereaux .
i know whoyou are .
i was with the 82nd
airborne .
yeah , i know .
i was in the 1 73rd at the time .
god , duty , honor , country
remember?
mm hmm .
where on capitol hill orwall street or hollywood haveyou heard anyone utter one ofthose phrases in the last 1 0 years?
what brings you to new york , general?
the president's concerned .
he's worried that haveyou met the president?
uh , no , i haven't .
i read the newspapers , though .
i know he's concerned about terrorism .
well , with all due affection for the man , the president doesn't know fuck all about the mideast or terrorism that i don't write on his cue cards .
he is an expert in covering his own ass , ifyou catch my meaning .
yes , i do .
so i guess you didn't come up here just for a cup ofcoffee , huh?
with all due respect ,
i thinkwe're on the right track .
that's exactly what i told the president .
the army's not some big green police machine .
stickwith the men on the ground is what i advised the president .
well , i appreciate your support .
as long as you're sureyou're not chasing your tail here .
so what can you tell me about the sheik ahmed bin talal?
just that he's old news .
but we received 2 communications from the bombers to release him .
we can't release him .
i know our stated policy is to never negotiate
we can't release him because we don't have him .
we never did .
our latest intel says that he's dead .
the agency doesn't think so .
the cla didn't know the berlin wall was coming down until bricks started hitting them in the head .
who's your source?
elise kraft .
a woman will never understand the middle east .
just between you and me ,
elise kraft wouldn't know a sheik from a prophylactic by the same name .
well , i , uh , appreciate the heads up .
hub , we followed up that tip on
why , elise , what a nice surprise .
how areyou?
hello , general .
how nice to seeyou again .
please , don't let me interrupt .
uh , sorry .

det cords , symtex .
just like the bus .
we got 'em .
3 men were reported killed today after a shootout with the fbi in a quiet neighborhood in brooklyn .
already there are unconfirmed reports ofa link between the victims , who are reported to be arab speaking , and the bombers ofbus 87 .
fbi spokesman , anthony hubbard .
uh , we are presently following up on as many leads , and , uh , we're confident that we're on the right track .
i thinkwe're all happy that these criminals are offthe streets , and we can all get on with our lives .
dad !
yeah !
i think the fbi deserves special recognition for the speed with which they handled this current crisis .
i'd especially like to single out
special agent tony hubbard and the men and women ofthe nypd , fbl ...
here we are .
drink up , everyone .
my first boyfriend was palestinian .
you know , my father used to say they seduceyou with their suffering .
haveyou ever been over there?
haveyou seen the camps?
no .
no , never been .
oh , there's these incredibly warm , hospitable people ,
living in this horrible place .
butyetyou work against them .
only the crazy .
i tend to be suspicious ofall true believers , present company included .
areyou saying i'm a fanatic?
why areyou a fed?
you read my file .
you tell me .
okay .
all right , i'll tell you .
catholic school ...
st. raymond's in the bronx .
president ofthis , captain ofthat , hard work , make a difference , fair play , change the system from within .
rah rah rah .
what?
what aboutyou?
what doyou believe?
like what?
like right and wrong .
it's easy to tell the difference between right and wrong .
is it? yes . what's hard is choosing the wrong that's more right .
i just ...
okay .
no , i just want to make things a little better , okay?
ignore me .
i'm shitfaced .
elise .
elise .
frank .
ahh .
hi .
tell us all about being a spook .
come on .
it's the bay of pigs .
you're there on the beach with all the girl scouts .
i love the wayyou guys predicted the fall of the soviet union .
genius .
yeah , yeah , yeah , right .
andj .
edgar hoover wore a dress , right?
mmm .
i love lebanese men .
come on , let's dance .
come on , hub .
dance with me .
sure .
it's yourwife .
oh .
oh, jeez .
this feels like high school .
yeah .
except my prom date didn't wear a gun .
so what's the latest on samir?
i want a list ofevery visa he sponsored .
i'm not sure he'll do it .
no?
you know , i once knew this undercover guy who cared so much for his source ...
he's a source , period .
you ever consider the fact that he might be in bed with the other side?
samir in bed with them?
that would be too much to wish for .
you're so confident .
only in bed .
it's a broadway theater .
it went offjust as people were getting up for intermission .
there are bodies everywhere .
sir , help 'em !
they're trapped inside !
no group has taken responsibility for the bombing yet so far as we know .
scores of the wealthiest and brightest of new york society were killed last night when a bomb ripped through a crowded theater .
the list ofvictims is a veritable who's who ofthe city's cultural leaders .
you can be sure that all of our considerable resources are being brought to bear on the situation .
new york city has been brought to its knees by the events ofthe past week .
retail sales are down 72 % .
hate crimes have skyrocketed .
and the fbi seems , at least for the moment , incapable ofstopping the terror .
once busy streets are eerily silent as many have fled .
ira , why do they let those people in the country?
they know who those people are .
ifyou think i'm gonna let my kids out there with all this stuffgoing on , you have got to be crazy .
the senate intelligence committee today authorized a special panel to investigate the current situation in new york city .
tonight at 1 0 : 00 terrorism in the united states .
the worst kind ofreaction is a reaction that's based on fear .
he says ifyou're on the state department terrorist watch list , you cannot get into the country .
so i sayali waziri was on the watch list , and he got in .
what did the state department say?
they told me to call i. n. s.
what did i. n. s. say?
they told me to call state .
oh , god !
the purpose ofthis meeting is to keep our city safe , and your department's responsibility
my department what , asshole? is to keep us safe .
look , i'm very sorry , but we're gonna have to raise our hands before we ask a question , okay?
yes , sir?
howard kaplan , i. n. s.
howyou doing , howard?
good , thanks .
so , we pulled every ethnic visa in the city and traced them to the source .
danny?
bring 'em in , and we talk to 'em .
what about translators?
how many people we talking about here?
1 , 600 , maybe more .
1 , 600?
that's right .
where are we gonna put 1 , 600 people?
danny , slow down , okay?
yes , sir?
what about a military presence atj fk and la guardia?
i don't thinkwe're thereyet , and i don't think it's gonna stop these criminals .
sir?
what about protecting the arab population?
there's a lot ofanger out there .
i represent the arab antidefamation league .
whatever injustices my people may be suffering at this very difficult moment , we will continue to show our commitment to this country .
i appreciate that . thankyou , sir .
and i want to thank everybody for their patience today .
this has been an extremely difficult
time .
london , paris ,
athens , rome ,
belfast , beirut
we're not the first city to have to deal with terrorism .
in tel aviv
in tel aviv , the day after they bombed the market in tel aviv , the market was open , and it was full .
this is new york city ...
we can take it .
oh , my god .
it's the buckley school .
not kids .
one ofthe moms was carrying a gun , wounds the guy as he's planting the device .
he kills her , then he locks them all on the roof .
any kids get hurt?
i don't know .
it's over there on the table .
i don't know ifit's a radio or a timer orwhat .
whoa , hold right there .
see ifyou can move in a little closer on the device .
right there .
focus that .
radio device .
he's got a radio control .
what the fuck's the news media doing here?
they must have been monitoring our frequency .
danny , your boys were supposed to call the f. a. a. to clear the airspace !
i'm on it , i'm on it .
do it now .
this is nypd ...
get those fuckin 'birds out ofhere !
hub .
everybody out .
takeyour time .
need some help here .
all right , come on .
eitherwe answer this threat quickly and convincingly , or next week , there will be a hundred more all over the world .
sounds great , general .
why can't we find out who's behind it?
it seems to me , gentlemen , that conventional law enforcement just isn't up to the task .
how about who's behind who's behind this?
either libya , iran , iraq , possibly syria .
ask a question , get an atlas .
all i know is that we must respond .
that's an excellent idea , senator .
how do we do that?
find out who they are and bomb the shit out ofthem .
and ifwe can't find out?
i hate to be the voice ofdoom , but it keeps escalating .
first a bus , then a theater .
what's next?
how about sending in the national guard?
the national guard is for riot control , senator , not for counterterrorism .
the army then .
i've read the contingency plans .
it's established legal doctrine posse comitatus . the army can't be turned against our own people .
even ifthat's what are own people are asking for , 3 to 1?
ifthe president's willing to declare a state of
president lincoln declared martial law in 1 862 . he suspended habeas corpus .
which the supreme court
later found unconstitutional .
ex parte millegan .
and i've got an election in november
ex united states congressman .
let's save the quips for the sunday morning talk shows .
the president's plane lands in 2 hours , and we owe it to him to have a consensus .
you don't fight ajunkyard dog with a. s. p. c. a. rules .
whatyou do is you take the leash offyour own bigger , meaner dog .
general .
the army's a broadsword , not a scalpel .
trust me , senator , you do not want the army in an american city .
but hypothetically , how long would it takeyou to deploy?
you know we can't go in until the president invokes the war powers act .
i understand that , general .
let's assume for a moment that the order has been given .
1 2 hours after the president gives the order , we can be on the ground .
one light infantry division of 1 0, 700 men .
elements ofthe rapid deployment force , special forces , delta ,
a. p. c. s , helicopters , tanks , and , ofcourse , the ubiquitous m 1 6 a 1 assault rifle .
a humble enough weapon until you see it in the hands ofa man outsideyour local bowling alley or 7 1 1 .
it will be noisy , it will be scary , and it will not be mistaken for a vfw parade .
i remind you , general devereaux does not speak for official army policy .
a police function has become accepted as our role in haiti and somalia .
make no mistake .
we will hunt down the enemy , we will find the enemy , and we will kill the enemy .
and no card carrying member ofthe aclu is more dead set against it than i am , which is why i urgeyou ...
i imploreyou ... do not consider this as an option .
i knowjust what the president's going to say .
that's exactlywhyyou're the only man for thejob .
i'd like to introduce anthony hubbard .
he's myasalc on the ground up in brooklyn .
his team was able to take out the first cell within 36 hours ofthe attack on the 87 bus .
he's also the man who took out the terrorist in that schoolhouse .
hub .
thejob ofthe fbi is to ... to respond .
thejob ofthe army to defend .
with the presence ofthe army , our ability to investigate will be seriously inhibited .
it will push these criminals further underground .
most importantly , you can't fight a war against an enemy you can't see .
i think ifwe exercise patience , restraint , allow our men and women up in new york to do theirjob ...
i thinkwe'll be effective .
thankyou , agent hubbard .
i , too , think that we should proceed with caution .
some ofyou may not know sharon bridger .
sharon was posted in iraq as part of our covert operations during the gulfwar .
sharon .
sir , ifi may .
thankyou .
i'm sure everyone here knows the traditional model ofthe terrorist network .
one cell controls all others .
cut offthe head , the bodywill wither .
unfortunately , the old wisdom no longer applies .
the new paradigm is each cell operates independent ofthe other .
cut offone head , another rises up in its place .
bus 87 was the work ofthe first cell whose remaining elements , we believe , the fbi took down .
this then activated the work ofcell 2 .
the theater gala .
at the most , we believe , there are 3 , possibly 4 cells .
well , then how much longer before we can take out the last cell?
we don't know .
this is a tragedy ofstaggering proportion .
one federal plaza was the headquarters ofthe fbi counterterrorism task force , as well as many other federal agents ...
authorities are withholding the names ofthose who died .
the worst in new york city's history .
the most devastating ...
letters ofcondolence have been received from leaders around the world .
boris yeltsin forwarded a message ...
body count's a little over 200 so far .
what about our people?
mike , tina .
theywere all in there working .
hub .
hub .
this is colonel hardwick , army intelligence .
colonel .
i'm here as an advisor only .
i intend to keep a low profile .
appreciateyour concern .
i don't mean to be insensitive , but , uh, just what exactly are your capabilities at this point?
your infrastructure?
you're standing on our infrastructure .
excuse me .
hey , hub , they managed to get a partial vi n number offthe van .
dmv says it was reported stolen the day before ... in brooklyn?
you got it .
hub , the final body count just came in .
600 dead .
i'm very sorry aboutyour friends .
frank , it's , uh ...
sharon .
i didn't catch your last name , sharon .
bridger .
howyou doing , frank?
been better .
well ... the agency came up with another list ofprobables .
i thinkwe should circulate them .
hey ... this stuffmight be good .
whywas there no warning from samir?
because he didn't know anything .
says samir .
says me .
maybe i'll ask him .
yeah , over my dead body .
over 600 dead bodies .
look , he's one ofthe good guys , okay?
how can you be so sure?
because he was part ofthe operation to destabilize saddam hussein with me , okay?
samir is a go between .
he risked his life for us over there .
go between who , sharon?
look , come on , i need names , okay?
i need i need photographs or something , okay?
i don't need a history lesson .
i can't giveyou pictures because i don't know what they look like .
we did everything at arm's length .
soyou got nothing?
i've got samir .
well , does samir have any contact with them?
minimal .
so how does he do it?
he can't .
they initiate .
and otherwise?
he's waiting .
he's he's waiting?
what the hell is he waiting for?
more bodies?
more buildings?
we got a lot ofbuildings out there .
maybe he's waiting to blow up a few more ofthem .
hey , look , i know howyou must feel .
hey , look , you don't know how i feel .
i lost friends ofmine tonight .
you don't know how i feel !
they'll make contact soon .
when?
that's what i want to know when?
why soon?
why not now?
what is the trade craft?
what are the visuals?
what are the iron sights?
you know , all that cla spy shit .
all right , i'll tell you what i'm going to do .
i'm going to take your boy samir downtown ,
i'm going to strap his ass to a polygraph machine , and i'm going to ask him questions aboutyou .
then i'm going to take those transcripts
i'm going to take them to a friend ofmine at the new york times whojust loves to write stories about the link between the cla and political horror shows .
ifyou burn him , you'll lose any chanceyou've got .
so what?
it's lose lose , isn't that whatyou said?
i'm not fucking with you .
how could you possibly rememberwhoyou're fucking?
24 hours .
forwhat?
24 hours forwhat , sharon?
elise .
have anything for me?
nothing new .
now , we've got 3 bombings in new york city .
we've got 600 people dead .
the nypd , the fbl , they don't seem up to it .
do we need to bring the army into this , arianna?
absolutely .
how many people have to die before we do bring the army ...
u. s. government troops are not trained to police their own population .
that's why we have an fbl .
that's whywe have a police force .
no .
you see
we don't want an occupying army in brooklyn .
i would imagine you would have to speak to the army to verify those rumors .
and here we have the fbi having failed to do theirjob , having failed ...
this is an attack .
this is a time ofwar .
the fact that it's inside our borders only means that it's a new kind ofwar .
this is the kind ofshit these towel heads do in their own country , and now they're bringing it here .
people must understand that the word " arab " is not synonymous with the word " terrorist .
islam is a religion ofpeace .
these people defile the holy koran when they use ...
you know there's a lot ofpent up frustration ...
a merchant , abdul hassam , was beaten today and his store vandalized .
the president released a statement today
one of our greatest freedoms is the freedom from fear , " and he pledged to protect that freedom with all the resources ...
the fbi has received another fax .
ahmed bin talal .
apparently , they're still under the impression that we have him .
do we ... have him?
let me giveyou a little advice , steve .
do not come between me and the president .
i am speaking for the president .
as far as the president is concerned , no , we do not have him .
general , did you know that afteryesterday's attack halfthe parents in this country kept their kids out ofschool?
they're attacking ourway oflife .
it ends now .
areyou saying the president is prepared to take the necessary steps?
i am saying the president is prepared to be presidential .
hello .
it's me .
turn on the tv .
hang on .
the senate remained in emergency session
late into the night debating the president's call for martial law .
we have , in this country , a tradition ofinvoking martial law ...
yeah , i got it . onlywhen the most dire ofcircumstances require it , but at what cost?
all eyes now turn to new york city to see ifmartial law will bring the terror to an end .
move it !
good morning .
today , with the invocation ofthe war powers act by the president ,
i am declaring a state ofmartial law in this city .
to the best ofour knowledge , we are opposed by no more than 20 ofthe enemy .
he is hiding among a population ofroughly 2 million .
intelligence tells us that he is most likely arab speaking , between the age of 1 4 and 30 narrowing the target to 1 5, 000 suspects .
we can further reduce that number down to those that have been in this country
less than 6 months .
nowyou have 20 hiding among 2, 000 .
ifyou are one ofthese 20 young men , you can hide among a population ofsimilar ethnic background .
unfortunately foryou , you can only hide there , and that population , in the classic immigration pattern , is concentrated right here in brooklyn .
we intend to seal off this borough , then we intend to squeeze it .
this is the land ofopportunity , gentlemen the opportunity to turn yourselves in .
after sundown tonight , anyyoung man fitting the profile i described who is not cooperating will be arrested and detained .
there is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale ofa population than policing its own citizens , but the enemywould be sadly mistaken iftheywere to doubt our resolve .
they are now face to face with the most fearsome military machine in the history ofman , and i intend to use it and be back on base in time for the playoffs .
thankyou foryour time .
good to seeyou again , hub .
can't say the same thing aboutyou , general not like this , not in that uniform .
i thought you were against this .
i am against this .
this was not my call .
soyou'rejust following orders , huh?
the president madeyou put tanks on the brooklyn bridge?
areyou questioning my patriotism?
i'm questioning yourjudgment .
negative , command .
i'm here serving my president and quite possibly not in the best interest ofour nation .
my profession does not allow me to make that kind ofdistinction .
i won't question your patriotism , but don'tyou ever again question my command .
doyou understand me?
i'm not underyour command .
you really believe that , hub?
take a look around and tell me that's true .
arrogant prick .
you ever met anybody so in love with the sound ofhis own voice?
we're putting samir into play .
now?
with all this going on?
he'll freak .
yeah , he'll freak .
i'm already freaked .
the whole damn city's freaked .
oh , fuck it one more lamb to the slaughter .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
it's fine .
he's cool .
what's he fucking doing here?
hey , doyou know what's happened outside?
they're killing arabs out there .
you can put a stop to it , samir .
what areyou talking about?
the army's here .
they're setting up interrogation centers right now .
they're torturing people in cellars .
calm down , all right?
i got to get out ofhere , and you have to help me .
we'll helpyou .

shut up !
stop simpering .
look , i've got a picture ofthe two ofus , samir .
you remember that picture?
well , i'm going to post it in every shop in brooklyn , and then i'm going to send copies to some friends ofmine in the west bank .
your mother's still there , isn't she?
all right , all right !
fucking let go ofme !
all right , get out ofhere .
get out !
i'm sorry .
hey , nobody's going to burn you , okay , samir? nobody's going to call anybody .
who asked you to get the visa?
oh , come on .

not long enough , apparently .
how much longer , doyou think , before he gives up the other cells?
he can't give up the other cells ifhe doesn't know where they are .
he knows .
no , he doesn't .
you said ityourself , sharon , didn'tyou?
in the strategy meeting , the briefing
the one cell doesn't know where the other one is , right?
how long before he breaks , sharon?
well , at this rate , too long .
the theaterwas hit 9 hours afterwe took down the first cell .
so ... what other models do we have?
shake him?
what about it , sharon?
won't work .
it works for the israelis .
only in conjunction with sleep deprivation .
it takes at least 36 hours .
we don't have 36 hours .
electric shock?
the neurotransmitters just shut down .
water?
palestinian authorities ... producing good intel with water .
ofcourse , there's cutting .
it's extremely messy .
areyou people insane?
what areyou talking about?
the time has come for one man to suffer in order to save hundreds oflives .
one man?
what about 2 , huh?
what about 6?
how about public executions , huh?
you're free to leave wheneveryou like .
come on , general , you lost men , i've lost men , butyou you can't do this .
what ifwhat they reallywant
what ifthey don't even want the sheik?
haveyou considered that?
huh?
what if what they reallywant is for us to herd children into stadiums
like we're doing?
and put soldiers on the street and and have americans looking over their shoulders?
bend the law , shred the constitution just a little bit?
because ifwe torture him , general ... we do that , and everything that we have bled and fought and died for is over , and they've won .
they've alreadywon .
escort him out .
aah !
he knew nothing .
aah !
you got to call offthe dogs .
we can't call offthe army until the threat is gone .
the army is the threat .
they're the ones out ofcontrol .
devereaux's killing innocent people .
you guys took the leash offofhim .
just put it back on him .
areyou wearing a wire?
areyou?
it was devereaux who took the sheik in the first place .
devereaux?
so we do have him?
what doyou think , hub?
our government operates as one coherent entity?
everybody , you and me , we all wanted that sheik's head on a plate .
devereaux didn't start this agenda about hunting down terrorists .
he'sjust kind of pushed it a little bit .
hang on a sec .
so , now what do we do?
there is this growing feeling in certain circles that we ought tojust let the sheik go set him free .
i mean , after all , we kidnapped him .
we kept him in isolation .
ajudge might let him walk .
you don't let a murderer go free any murderer .
any murderer !
sharon thinks we can get to the last cell ifthey believe we're going to release the sheik .
why should they trust her?
i mean , why should i trust her?
ask her .
i ran the network in iraq for 2 years .
samir recruited them from among the sheik's followers , and i trained them in the north .
the sheikwas going to help us overthrow saddam .
i mean , he was our ally .
we were financing him .
and then ... then there was a policy shift .
it's not like we sold them out exactly .
wejust stopped helping them .
theywere slaughtered .
so i quit the operation .
i took another assignment .
butyou helped them first .
what doyou mean?
you said theywere being slaughtered .
they needed to get out .
theywere on the terrorist watch list , soyou got them visas , you and samir .
i promised them we would take care ofthem .
theywere working for us .
doing what exactly?
i told you .
no , you didn't .
you told me thatyou trained them trade craft , subversion .
that's whatyou said , wasn't it?
you're leaving something out , aren'tyou , sharon?
you taught them ... how to make bombs .
that's whyyou were looking for the wiring signatures on that blue bus .
and now they're here ... doing whatyou taught them how to do .
right?
you've got to let me make this right .
please?
the president is in close conference with the mayor of new york , the governor of new york , and the attorney general of new york , and i can assureyou ...

thejewish community opposes the military to take back in a peaceful fashion our democracy from the people ...
the people of brooklyn will not be held hostage !
join community and religious leaders in a march to protest ...
well , what ifit was black people , huh?
