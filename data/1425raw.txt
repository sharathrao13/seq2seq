crlmson rlvers
we'll touch base in two hours .
which way do we go?
there .
okay?
see you later , guys .
can i help you?
got a light?
who let you through?
your men ...
commissioner pierre niemans .
just you?
paris said they'd send a unit .
what the hell?
i'm the unit .
captain ,
i didn't drive all night to wage war with cops .
what's the low down?
follow me .
two days ago , the college dean reported remy callois missing .
thirty two years old , single .
remy lectured at the college .
he was also the librarian .
an upper echelon job there .
according to the dean , remy was punctual and hardworking .
he never showed up late .
yesterday afternoon a young mountain climber found his body .
why call in the vice squad?
we're not used to this kind of stuff .
why?
his body was strung up there ...
at 150 feet .
you're vice but not really vice , is that it?
that's it .
we never dealt with you before .
you're lucky .
happy is he who penetrates the hidden causes of things
what's this college doing here?
no ordinary college : it provides its own electricity , its own water .
it even has a hospital .
1200 students .
100 professors and researchers .
one of europe's oldest universities .
in case of a snowstorm , it can survive for a month .
the dean is like the mayor of the valley .
he runs most ofthe region .
here's where they form future bill gateses .
future what?
future bill gateses ...
the hospital's attached to the college?
it's open to everyone in the region .
we all get free health care .
we work a lot with them .
there's even a maternity wing .
this is commissioner niemans .
he'll be helping on this case .
i was in your criminology class in 1987 .
did you start yet?
i haven't cut the cord .
can we see?
i figured you'd want to see him intact .
it's incredible .
the work of a real madman .
he strove for the fetal position .
what position?
the fetal .
like a fetus in its mother's belly .
he's been dead for 48 hours .
examination reveals traces of incisions on the shoulders , arms , elbows and thighs made by a sharp instrument .
a carpet cutter .
can you cut the cord?
four broken ribs .
arms broken at the shoulders and elbows .
multiple fractures : tibia , hip ...
i'll put it all in a detailed report .
the hands were amputated before he died , with an axe . the stumps cauterized to avoid his bleeding to death .
the killer obviously wanted to keep his victim alive .
i wouldn't do that ...
he carved out the eyes like a surgeon .
operating on a live patient .
what the fuck is this shit?
the sockets were filled with rain .
it's being analyzed .
there's a good eye doctor in guernon .
he may shed some light on this .
how long did it take him to die?
i'd have to cut him open , but i'd say 5 hours .
the size and precision of the wounds indicate that he wanted his victim conscious , but in the greatest possible state of pain .
check every prison , every loony bin and sect .
every trail , refuge and ski slope .
run random identity checks on drivers in a 100 mile radius .
dig up evidence of similar mutilations in the past 20 years .
talk to possible witnesses and callois 'colleagues .
anyone who knew his itinerary .
find out where it rained in the past two days .
find anything : witnesses , clues .
you have two hours .
who's there?
who's there?
who is it?
why won't you talk?
doctor !
what's going on?
get the dog out of here .
it's nothing .
go home .
everything's all right .
see you on tuesday .
who are you?
commissioner niemans .
sorry , dogs scare me shitless .
dogs are not to fear .
just their masters .
how can i help you?
i'm investigating remy callois 'death .
i heard about it .
how awful .
did you know him?
i knew his father .
we went to college together .
did you teach at the college?
for 20 years .
but i stopped teaching ... in 1982 .
why?
difference of opinion .
with the dean?
i don't understand ...
what's the link between me and remy?
i have some pictures i'd like your opinion of .
he was tortured?
for several hours .
how horrible ...
i didn't know .
no hands?
nor eyes .
that's why i'm here .
to understand these mutilations .
how would i know?
what exactly do you treat?
genetic afflictions concerning the eyes .
hereditary diseases transmitted from one generation to the next .
they strike isolated areas ... and with the college ...
what about the college?
teachers have been marrying among themselves for ages .
the bloodlines are weak , worn out ...
genetic problems keep popping up .
the ransom of the elite .
i thought professors 'kids were prodigies .
they are .
i don't get it .
over the past two generations , the situation has reversed .
the native mountain children are getting sick .
like the boy you just saw .
could there be a connection between the mutilations and the diseases?
hands and eyes are the body parts that belong to us alone .
they're different from anyone else's , like with dna .
they're our ... biological identity .
your killer is giving you hints as to his motive .
and he starts stabbing away ...
he stabs the dog , stabs the guy , grabs the bag and throws the knife under the car !
seriously , paris is full of psychos !
the subway !
the cops !
robo cops !
hand over your ticket , please !
what the hell?
i'm happy with my cows !
i'm happy here !
fresh air !
it's amazing here .
take a look at my cows !
it's the county mounties !
hi , kids .
cool it ...
can we go now?
happy squirrel hunting !
you want the roach?
you smoke?
i always have .
you didn't before !
now i do .
you're smoking on duty .
he does !
you're lower on the totem pole .
where does that put you?
harry and sally !
why did you come for me?
the cemetery got robbed last night .
the word is " desecrated " .
the elementary school got desecrated too .
the word is " robbed " , dickwad .
two in a day !
we're back in business , guys !
let's start with the cemetery .
i'm riding high today .
pass the joint .
what now?
nothing !
you're sulking .
because you're smoking !
do i sulk when you drink?
cut the crap !
you sound like two old hookers .
you're here for the desecration .
follow me ...
it's the girl's mausoleum .
the only mausoleum in the cemetery .
when i got here this morning , this is what i found .
it's those skinheads .
they're always hanging around here !
we have skinheads?
not skinheads . just kids .
skinhead kids?
just kid kids .
did this ever happen before?
the first time .
1972 1982 .
she didn't make it too far .
stop that !
you have no right .
you need her parents 'say so .
i know the law !
relax .
no problem .
where can i find the parents?
her mother was crazy .
she said the devil killed her kid .
the devil?
you heard me .
where are your skinheads?
a warehouse in town .
let's pay them a little visit .
first the school .
the principal's expecting us .
what's she missing?
nothing's missing .
that's what's so strange .
i've never seen you .
are you new here?
is it that obvious?
what did you do to end up here?
cops are like teachers .
we can't always choose our school .
tell me about it !
for 14 years , i've asked to be transferred !
they broke in here .
where we keep school records .
they went about it extremely carefully .
are you sure nothing's missing?
nothing at all .
i checked this morning .
it's so weird !
i don't understand .
okay ...
file a complaint at the station this afternoon .
so the investigation's over?
what can i say?
no theft , no investigation .
have a nice day .
good bye .
good bye , detective .
detective " is pass .
it's " lieutenant " now .
just a second !
how long have you been here?
not as long as you seem to think .
if i say a name , could it ring a bell?
try me ...
judith herault .
was she one of my students?
she died in 1982 .
should i check?
i'd appreciate it .
you think there's a connection?
you tell me ...
i wonder if she's the one who got run over .
run over?
killed in a highway accident .
it was terrible .
what else?
it was a truck .
the mother was there .
she became insane .
how can i find the mother?
what's wrong?
the pages are torn out .
the pages from '81 and '82 .
bingo !
any pictures?
class photos ... stuff like that .
the pictures are missing too .
i'll be right back .
what's the problem?
any highway patrolmen here?
not one .
they're all out to lunch .
what for?
i need some info .
i'm a cop myself .
information about what?
an accident that happened around here 20 years ago .
it's your lucky day .
they call me " gravedigger " .
over the past 27 years , i've seen 248 no , wait ... 249 accidents entailing deaths .
on our part of the highway alone .
50 miles !
cops and firemen get all the attention .
but we're the first guys on the scene .
it's all in here .
what do you want to know?
you can use that?
what do you think?
i'm looking for the parents of a girl killed in '82 .
judith herault .
that sounds familiar .
here we go ...
mile marker 98 .
september '82 .
she was that kid?
that's right .
just a sec .
1982 ...
it's coming back now .
she was run over by a 38 ...
what a goddamned mess !
here she is .
here's her file , with the policemen's statements , pictures and all ...
i'm warning you : the pictures are ...
don't worry .
i warned you .
jesus !
what happened?
a 38 ton truck going 80 miles an hour ...
how did you identify her?
when we got there , the mother was at the side of the road .
she was holding ...
what?
a finger .
the only piece of her daughter still intact .
she said her kid ran away and tried running across the highway .
god knows what happened .
you don't have the mother's number?
are you kidding?
it's been 20 years !
the insurance company sent us an address in case we came across any new leads .
this is too crazy !
the dean's office?
that way , on your left .
i want to see the dean .
i'm his assistant .
how can i help?
by getting me the dean , now .
who shall i say is here?
commissioner niemans .
commissioner niemans for you .
have a seat .
i'll just be a minute .
i'm a slave to this university .
i never have enough time .
what can i do?
i'm investigating callois 'death .
i spoke to captain dahmane .
tell me about remy's private life .
do you work with dahmane?
neither with nor without .
i lead a special unit .
you ...
i don't understand what happened .
remy never posed the slightest problem .
he was kind , hardworking .
his parents were close friends .
he took over his father's job in the library .
he went to school here?
like most of us .
many students are born and grow up here .
some become professors , like their parents .
it's sort of the tradition .
it was the case with remy .
he didn't have a police record .
maybe there's something we missed , that may be of help .
like what?
someone who hated him .
drug use , some religious conviction ...
i think you misunderstood me .
this university is a community , a temple of knowledge .
everyone lives and works here in perfect harmony .
to accuse one of us is to accuse all of us , including me .
i want to visit his apartment .
i'm afraid that's impossible .
the police sealed it off .
i'd like to see it all the same .
hubert , come here , please .
unfortunately , i can't join you .
i hope you don't mind if my son shows you the way .
as i told you , traditions are a way of life here .
we've been voted " best college " three years in a row .
we even helped raise the national average .
just for fun , we calculated the average iq here .
guess how much .
twenty four .
excuse me?
callois had room 24 .
do you have the key?
no .
do you have permission to go in?
what did he do at the library?
he was in charge of books and seating arrangements .
seating arrangements?
our tradition is to be seated in the same place every year .
it's beneficial and makes seating easier .
dominissimus , simusserve , ubicum que ...
we are the masters .
we are the slaves .
we are everywhere .
we are nowhere .
we control the crimson rivers .
it was his phd .
he'd been working on it for years .
fanny ferreira?
up there .
fanny ferreira?
you discovered remy callois 'corpse?
who are you?
pierre niemans .
i came from paris to investigate .
paris exports cops now?
depends on the case .
too bad .
i like the local yokels .
their seriousness cracks me up .
me too .
you can make a difference?
i've been trying to for 25 years .
maybe you can help .
i doubt it .
i didn't see much .
i scaled the cliff twice before noticing him .
didn't you read my statement?
did the killer have to be strong to get the body up there?
not necessarily .
with know how and good equipment , you can lift anything , anywhere .
what was he like?
a pretentious asshole .
like most students here .
i agree .
it seems pretty ...
uptight?
exactly .
a closed circuit race course for high performance cars .
if you've been around once ...
i read that you're a glaciologist .
what do you do?
i control avalanches .
the school's in a valley , so i try to steer them away .
you protect the school .
i do my job .
like remy callois .
what?
you went to , and worked for , the school , like remy callois .
so?
you're part of the clan .
what clan?
the elite composed of professors 'kids .
i have a busy day and i don't like uniforms .
your colleagues have my number .
it's the pathologist .
i got the results of the water in his eyes .
it's rain water ... acid rain .
what?
it's pretty common .
but we haven't had any acid rain since the 1970s .
and it hasn't rained recently .
i don't get it .
it's ice cold .
freezing .
hello , sister .
i'm a police officer ...
does a certain mrs. herault reside here?
may i ask why?
i'm sorry .
i'm afraid not .
i can't say .
sister andre has been here for 17 years .
this concerns a relatively old incident .
could i possibly see her?
i'll see ...
come in .
wait here .
take off your cap ...
where do you think you are?
my son !
wait here .
sister andre will see you .
but i should warn you ...
what?
you can speak to her , but you cannot see her .
you can listen , but you cannot go near .
why not?
the shadows , my son .
what about the shadows?
sister andre took the vow of the shadows .
we haven't seen her for 15 years .
sister ...
sister andre?
i'm a police officer from sarzac , just nearby ...
your daughter is buried there , right?
judith was your daughter , wasn't she?
i'm here because last night someone tried to open her tomb .
they're coming back .
who?
they're coming back to complete their mission .
who are you talking about?
the demons .
they want to make sure judith won't cause them any more trouble .
so it's these demons who killed your daughter?
could you try being a little more explicit?
for 18 years i've been trying to forget .
last night , your demons broke into the school and stole judith's class picture .
i need your help to understand why .
in order to erase every trace of my child .
what for?
to protect their secret .
what secret?
judith's face is a threat to them .
please , sister ...
i'm sorry , but ...
can you tell me the circumstances of your daughter's death?
my daughter fell ill .
we went to the hospital she was born in .
then the demons attacked us .
they chased us .
i wanted to run away , to disappear with my daughter .
but they found us .
no one can escape their clutches .
where did you live before sarzac?
the nightmare began in guernon .
did you try calling the police for help?
i speak of demons and you speak of police .
there's nothing you can do for my child .
save your soul while you still can .
leave me now .
i want to stop remembering .
forgive me .
glaciers are formed from years of compacted snow .
the snow is compressed into ice .
each season has a corresponding stratum .
this glacier is 600 feet deep .
it's a huge source of water and energy .
the water composing it dates back centuries .
what's the point of studying glaciers?
the college power plant has a research lab .
this glacier is sliding .
we study the risk factor it represents .
here .
how far down do we have to go?
at least 100 feet .
why did you choose me?
there are great guides in the area .
they say you're the best .
and i had you under my thumb .
you enlist civilians to find murderers?
let's say i'm picking you up .
put this on .
don't walk on the rope .
welcome to the time machine , commissioner .
i'll compare this ice to the acid rain you had analyzed .
we're at the right depth .
he must have brought us here for a reason .
there must be a clue ... a trace .
niemans , that's dangerous !
we can't stay here .
water can come gushing in at any second .
what's back there?
natural water canals .
what are you doing?
where are you going?
where are we?
an intra glacial canal , dug out by the water that feeds the power plant .
we can't stay here .
it's dangerous .
let's go .
what's wrong?
the light brigade !
what'll it be , guys?
nothing today .
the chief wants to see your tenants .
in back .
what's up?
i'm coming .
stay here .
i'll have a word with them .
a glass of red?
hello , gentlemen .
i'd like to speak to the manager .
the head honcho .
the leader of your little group .
what for?
police .
i'm new in the neighborhood .
lt. max kerkerian .
i have some questions .
don't bother .
we know you .
we don't talk to cops .
i'll do the talking .
what can we do for you?
tell me about your whereabouts last night .
what's the problem?
some kids sprayed swastikas on a mausoleum .
why ask us?
skinheads , swastikas ... swastikas , skinheads ...
no swastikas here .
see any swastikas?
what stickers?
swastikas .
you're not skinheads?
so what?
you didn't do the school?
what school?
you didn't hear me .
we don't talk to cops .
so get lost .
no school for you .
and you?
what school?
sheriff school?
you think you're cool?
relax .
hands off ! .
policeman is doing his job .
i'm just doing my job .
what's his job?
to piss us off?
yeah .
my job is to piss off your type .
what's our type?
what's our type?
i hate fascists .
did you figure that out all by yourself?
cool it !
what's he after?
don't play his game !
this is private property .
you better get out .
i know the law .
yeah , get lost !
thanks for your help .
cops think they're so cool !
a gun and badge and you rule !
son of a bitch !
watch this , greaseball .
no gun .
no badge .
what did he say?
what?
i'm not a cop now .
not a cop now?
the cowboy rode off?
hands off .
what did he say?
what was it?
son of a bitch .
son of a bitch .
kill the motherfucker !
get him !
what happened?
max kerkerian wins !
warmed up?
come and fight me , motherfucker .
watch out , he's getting his gun !
freeze !
did you stick a gun at me?
game over !
stop , it wasn't us !
what wasn't you?
last night at the cemetery .
we saw a guy in a white lada .
why didn't you say so?
you didn't ask !
next time you point a gun , check for bullets , asshole .
great vino .
very tasty .
excellent bouquet .
really stunning .
what happened?
it wasn't them .
we never had a problem with them .
we do now .
what the hell?
son of a bitch !
come here !
you'll be sorry !
asshole !
what's going on?
the keys !
a list of every white lada in the area .
every single one !
in one hour .

every white lada .
white what?
lada .
how do you spell it?
beats me .
just take a guess .
l a d a.
here .
how are you doing?
okay .
sorry i got you into this .
you think it's a serial killer?
no , a serial killer kills in order to exist .
i'd say we're dealing with a pointer .
a pointer?
we go where he points .
what for?
what for?
either he's pointing us in a direction i don't understand ...
or?
or he's playing with us .
commissioner ...
we've identified the body .
are you out there , chief? .
find anything?
we found all the ladas .
there are 132 in the region .
what do we do?
anything in a town called guernon , with a " g "?
guernon , yeah .
one white lada .
give me the name .
it belongs to philip sertys .
good job .
we'll talk later .
don't do this to me , motherfucker !
his name is philip sertys .
he graduated from here .
twenty nine years old , single .
became a doctor at 25 .
he worked in the maternity wing .
did he live on campus?
no , in town .
do you have his address?
what exactly do you want?
to understand .
get to work !
stand up , nice and slow .
don't move !
i'm a cop .
i said i'm a cop !
keep it slow .

don't move !
you're under arrest .
i'm a cop !
give me my gun .
they teach lock picking at the academy?
commissioner niemans .
pierre niemans?
yeah .
sorry ...
couldn't you say so?
why are you here?
to see a suspect .
what's his name?
philip sertys .
why?
pierre niemans?
great technique !
what are you looking for?
don't touch anything .
chill out .
can i breathe at least?
the guy's a real dog lover .
judith ...
we're talking total dog freak .
wait !
what's the problem?
come on !
i can't believe it !
mega cop is scared of pooches !
don't worry .
come on ...
come here , sonny .
careful !
that one may bite !
you ever stop blabbing?
just joking .
mother fuckers !
you know what this place is?
the lab of a guy who experiments on dogs .
using genetics to make a perfect fight dog .
he has all the equipment .
look ...
this is really gross .
did you see?
where are you going?
where are you going?
to see your suspect .
you know where he is?
so where are we going?
what do you want sertys for?
desecration .
and you?
where?
in sarzac , about 60 miles from here .
why do you want him?
sarzac .
where's the lighter?
do you never answer questions?
or is it me?
take a left .
okay , chief .
i'll take a left .
this will be a barrel of laughs .
sir?
he's with me .
so?
same method of strangulation .
same killer .
i'm sure .
but this guy wasn't tortured .
the hands aren't torture?
they were cut off after he died .
i don't get a thing .
what i don't get is why he still has his eyes .
did you start the autopsy?
not yet .
there are no wounds .
there must be some clue .
what kind of clue?
i'm not sure .
but i'm sure it's here .
we have to look .
hold on ...
tweezers , please .
you won't believe this .
glass eyes .
like in an eye doctor's office or at medical school .
get your men and meet me at cherneze's office .
tell me what's going on !
you're asking me?
can i know where you're going?
butt out .
wait for me at the station .
you're kidding !
he's as much my witness as yours !
i didn't make it this far to go back empty handed .
this isn't child's play .
i can't be your teacher .
stop acting like some kind of living legend !
i can teach you too .
i work alone !
that makes two of us !
where are we?
did you ever shoot someone?
i never had to .
good .
i want him alive .
who?
who , god damn it?
what the fuck is this?
what are we looking for?
can you tell me?
if you talk to me , maybe i can help .
the other stairway !
don't move !
run !
i will track the source of the crimson rivers .
would it kill you to tell me what's going on?
i have no idea !
that's an answer .
so?
so i'm comparing the fingerprints .
there's no match .
no criminal on our files .
can you scan this print?
no problem .
what's that?
a girl who died 20 years ago .
she led me here .
if she died 20 years ago , we got a problem .
she's the one who shot at you .
these prints are a perfect match with the ones on the gun , except for the age difference .
we need to talk .
so we talk now?
last night sertys went to a cemetery .
into the vault of judith herault , who died in 1982 .
he couldn't open the coffin , so he tried misleading us with swastikas .
that night , someone broke into the elementary school and stole pictures and documents from '81 and '82 , the two years judith herault attended that school .
she's one of these kids .
how did she die?
run over by a truck .
they called it an accident .
but the mother told me something completely different .
according to her , her daughter was killed by demons .
demons ...
she has a major screw loose .
she's been in a convent since .
but i got the impression she wasn't telling me all ...
did you grill her or have tea?
i was investigating a misdemeanor .
i couldn't punch her to get her to talk .
she's a nun .
your turn .
tell me what's going on .
it's a treasure hunt .
each corpse leads to the next one .
let's say that
sertys , callois and cherneze are linked by an incident that happened 20 years ago .
two days ago they learn callois is dead .
we find the body .
they panic .
the past resurfaces .
they go to the cemetery and the school to find something out ... to check something ...
but what?
if judith is really dead .
why?
she's seeking revenge .
the nun probably faked her death .
and the prints?
fingers can be cut off .
the guy who shot at me had five fingers .
why did he let you live?
so i'd understand his vengeance .
what links the three victims?
callois was head librarian .
sertys worked in the maternity ward .
cherneze worked with the dean .
it all leads to the university .
i better get back .
what about me?
see if judith is dead .
i knew you'd say that .
i get the fun stuff .
call me with any news .
what are you doing here?
your colleagues held me for four hours .
sorry ...
everyone's on edge .
want a ride?
sure ...
so cherneze is dead too?
did you know him?
one ofthe college's last dinosaurs .
you don't seem to appreciate the geniuses you live among .
i don't respect intellectuals much .
weren't your parents professors?
i don't respect my parents much .
take a left here .
is anyone expecting you?
you're a lousy don juan .
nice place .
i like it .
it's far from everything .
no tv , no radio , even cell phones don't work .
a grenade?
i use them to trigger avalanches .
are all the locals like you?
battling mountains helps forge your character .
same goes for cops .
have you been one for long?
too long .
buy lighter fluid .
i should .
but i'm trying to quit .
it was a gift .
from your ex?
i never got married .
how about you?
almost .
with the dean's son .
that could never work .
it sure was intended to .
after three years face to face in a reading room , you get close .
why do you hate the school so much?
why do you suspect me?
you climb mountains .
you found the first body , helped me find the second .
you're the perfect suspect .
except for one thing .
what?
you're incapable of strangling someone for ten minutes , eye to eye .
i have to go .
thanks for the tea .
tell me about remy callois 'thesis .
he talks about the myth of olympus ,
greek athletes who combined mind and body .
he refers a lot to the berlin olympic games of 1936 when german athletes fueled nazi propaganda .
and crimson rivers?
flow with the blood of perfect men .
blood?
veins ...
you want my opinion?
seriously , this thesis is a potpourri of nazi crap .
at the end , it's like " how to be a perfect fascist .
he explains how to create a perfect man of today .
how?
by combining brawny kids with brainy ones .
by selecting them and marrying them .
it's called ...
eugenics .
eugenics , that's it .
like nazis tried in some villages during the war .
like at this school .
healthy minds ... in healthy bodies .
what are you doing?
you have no business here !
what role did callois play exactly?
callois ...
sertys ...
cherneze ...
it all leads here .
what are you after?
you suspect us , don't you?
victims can be guilty too .
watch what you say , niemans .
i inquired about you .
you're on the razor's edge ...
i'd gladly put you first on the list .
all that's stopping me is the desire to prove you're behind it all .
am i wrong?
am i?
stop it !
are you crazy?
you'll be hearing from me !
can't i leave you alone for a minute?
what did you find in the tomb?
i don't know if it'll be any help .
it's not her .
you know her?
she helped with the case .
she helped you?
to understand the meaning of the crimson rivers .
they've lived in a closed circuit here for ages .
inbreeding led the professors to start having degenerate kids .
so they needed new blood .
new blood?
in the maternity wing , they replaced professors 'kids with healthy newborn mountain babies .
sertys 'father exchanged fanny with judith?
and plenty of others .
what for?
to create a superior race .
nazis?
a freaking nazi college?
not a college .
a breeding ground .
shoot !
shoot !
it's bulletproof .
aim for the same spot .
go on , shoot !
are you okay?
who's this bastard?
the dean's son .
what did he want?
to stop us from knowing what they did to fanny .
what could he do to fanny?
he was ten back then .
he was exchanged .
he was seated with fanny at the library .
he should have married her .
that was the plan .
so then why is she killing them all off?
she refuses to play by their rules .
you think she's innocent?
my coat !
hold on ... " la niemans " ...
who is this babe ofyours?
lady cliffhanger?
shit !
are you still not sure?
to think she brought me here !
i could have seen it all .
she could have operated on you too !
she didn't want to kill me .
she left me alive .
what are you talking about?
she left you alive , but three other guys didn't make it .
your girlfriend's hobby is to cut up her boyfriends .
why the treasure hunt?
what are you talking about?
she's a schizoid !
a psycho killer !
she wants us to understand .
what's to understand?
she wants to get caught .
good news .
that's our job , right?
now we just have to find her .
that's our job ...
what now?
she took the grenades .
what grenades?
closed up like a fucking clam ...
did you evacuate the college?
i need an explanation first !
it's not the time for explanations .
evacuate .
this can't go on .
who's up there?
i go alone .
it's everyone or no one !
i'm going alone .
everyone freeze !
calm down ...
no one is coming .
have you gone berserk?
give me that .
trust me .
lower your arms .
we have to go all the way now .
leave her to me .
down there !
fanny , turn around .
come down .
this is the end .
it's over now .
i know who you are .
you know nothing !
stop it !
i know what they did to you .
exchanging newborn babies ...
killing kids ...
i know .
it's too late .
you can't help .
go away !
you led me here .
i can't turn back .
neither can i !
don't do that !
they'll close down the college .
they're all dead now .
you'll kill innocent people .
they're all guilty !
no one is innocent !
judith?
twins !
they exchanged twins !
just one .
that's why her face was a threat to them .
take care of her .
so who died in the car accident?
what about the fingerprint?
mommy prepared it all .
the other girl was already dead .
mommy planned everything .
except your going haywire .
you thoughtyou'd make it?
i don't intend to make it .
freeze or you really won't make it .
stop !
leave her alone !
i'll trigger an avalanche .
fanny , listen to me .
stay away !
the men who hurt you are all dead .
if you do this , they'll win .
only you can stop her , fanny .
you're not a monster like her .
stop before it's too late .
i have no choice .
you do .
stop !
kill him .
for our lives .
for those of our parents .
for the lives they stole from us .
kill him .
not him .
he's innocent .
kill him !
do it for me .
for the life i never had .
a life in your shadows .
they created you .
and they rejected me .
do it .
kill him , fanny .
kill him !
you wanted him to understand .
you can't do that .
it's you and me .
go on .
go on !
don't .
you're not like her .
but i am .
do it !
you had to understand , so no one could forget .
i know ...
hurry !
take her feet !
can i ask a question?
what do you have against dogs?
it was a long time ago ...
