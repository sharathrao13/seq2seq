this is kind of fun .
it's not fun !

i think we lost him .
you might wanna look to your right .

signaling .
i know the rules .

you're mine now , ryan .
it's too tight .
we're not gonna make it .
we'll make it .
we're not gonna make it !
who's the professional here , you or me?
i wanna say you .
go !
look , there's a gate !
i'm sorry .
take some of that .
are you trying to kill us?
i just saved your life , and you're criticizing me?
welcome to my world .
what's that supposed to mean?
it means you're always looking down on me .
looking down on you?
yeah .
i've been looking out for you .
hey .
let me out of this car !
thanks for nothing !
how have you been looking out for me?
are you insane?
that's all i ever do !
the one day , the one time i want it to be about me for a change ... ... i get inducted into the roxy ryan school of juvenile delinquency .
i've been trying to help you from the minute we left .
lot of good that's done .
where are you going?
i'm not finished .
yeah , well , i am .
why don't you run along and have fun .
that's what you're good at .
as opposed to you , which is walking away whenever we have a real conversation?
i don't have time for a real conversation .
i'm too busy taking care of things .
so who asked you to?
you did .
the minute you stopped taking responsibility for anything since mom died .
that doesn't mean you get to be her replacement .
you know what i miss most about mom?
is that she loved that we were different .
and you punish me for it .
from the day mom died ... ... you've done nothing but push me out of your life .
i have not .
oh , come on , jane .
the biggest day of your academic career , and you didn't even bother to invite me .
well , forgive me for wanting the day to be about me for a change .
i make honor roll , dad doesn't notice because you're in detention .
i'm captain of the cheerleading squad , and dad can't come to one game .
one game , because he's busy going to your parent/ counselor meetings .
you wanna know why i want this fellowship abroad?
it's because it's 3000 miles away from you .
well , i really hope you get it , then .
roxy .
don't you worry .
i'm not going to let the mean little man hurt you .
hey , i don't know who you are or what your game is ... ... but you've caused me a great deal of inconvenience today .
not to mention , i am this close to missing my speech .
so let's have it .
let's have it .
you finished?
you snooze , you lose .
anyone , help !
let's take her to ma .
perfect timing .
hello !
help !
help !

hello?
roxy?
trey?
yeah .

can we talk after you open the trunk?
thanks .
are you okay?
what happened?
i'm coming to find you , next thing i know , this limo guy just shoves me in there .
just when you think the day can't get any worse .
you okay?
i just got in a huge fight with my sister .
she was gonna give a speech today .
now she won't win the fellowship ... ... because there's no way she's getting there on time , and it's all my fault .
you sure about that?
do you wanna take a field trip right now?
yeah .
come on .
okay .
taxi !
now , it's just you and me .
all alone .
no excuses .
come on .

drink this , and then the chip will come out .
this goes in here , chip come out here .
i'm not kidding around .
drink it .
see?
like that .
hey , that's pretty good .
come on .
this movie isn't out yet .
neither is this cd .
so that's what these guys are up to .
just listen to me .
give me that chip .
you don't want me to use this , do you?
i don't even know what this is .
but it's not gonna be pleasant .
now , give me the chip !
look into my eyes .
i'm torturing you .
it's unbearable !
bennie !
this is your idea of torture?
it's pathetic !
we do it my way .
cats have nine lives .
i wonder if little doggy does .
okay .
i hope they haven't started .
i can't run in these heels .
the increase and/ or decrease in a nation's productivity ... ... or other such political aggregate ... ... can be regarded as the penultimate indicator of a nation ...
go see what she's doing .

good luck .
thanks .
nice blazer , muffie .
oh , gridlock !
do you have a horn?
we'll take a shortcut .
hey , what are you doing?
sorry .
excuse us .
sorry .
what's the matter with you?
in this instance , we must defer to the famed economist , adam smith ... ... who laid the foundation of a free market .
mother .
what are you doing here?
i'm honorary chair of the mcgill fellowship .
what are you doing here?
i wanted to see you present the award .
well , that's very sweet .
our last finalist is from long island and has a 4 . 2 gpa .
she's student body president and captain of her cheerleading squad .
please welcome jane ryan .
keep it together .
it's okay .
oh , my god .
you may proceed ... ... miss ryan .
please .
right .
oh , man .
well ... ... as many of you all know ... ... the economy is ... ... very , very important to all of us .
take the word " economy .
you have " eco , " which stands for environment .
you know , which we're all real big supporters of .
and we have " onomy , " which ... ... is pig latin for " money .
money , economy .
right .
go , go , go .
good luck .
okay .
are you coming?
come on .
yeah .
why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
i see the way you're acting , like you're somebody else , gets me frustrated .
you fall , and you crawl ... ... and you break , and you take what you can get .
you turn it into honesty ... ... and promise me i'm never gonna find you fake it .
no .
no .
no .
oh , thank god .
roxy?
well , ladies and gentlemen , that's all the time i have for ...
so ... ... will the real jane ryan please stand up?
reinaldo !
trey , what is going on?
apparently , the dog groomer delivers .
are you okay?
what are you doing here?
well , aside from completely humiliating myself ...
i'm sorry .
i wanted to read the speech for you ...
no .
please .
here .
i can take it from here .
are you sure?
ladies and gentlemen , my name is jane ryan .
roxy , behind you !
nassau county department of truancy .
this girl , roxanne ryan , is now in my custody .
and that girl , jane ryan , is an accomplice in her criminal activities !
and she stole my stupid ugly mutt too .
i don't know what is going on here , but that " mutt " is mine .
come here , ugly doggy .
and i order you to give him back .
yeah , you and what army , lady?
officer !
me?
arrest that man !
yes , ma'am .
oh , my baby .
fly .
every time .
hey , that's my mom's dog !
i think it started .
it doesn't look like cats .
everybody , freeze .
someone please explain to me what is going on .
i think i can do that .
see , this guy over here ... ... that man who thinks he's chinese ...
you're not .
and his mother are criminals dealing in pirated music , movies ... ... and probably gucci handbags .
i don't know .
probably .
the guy with the eyebrows .
we know him .
he drove us over here .
he didn't tell us he was in the play .
a cop and an actor .
and how , may i ask , did you two get involved in this?
i think i can shed some light on that .
you see ... ... senator , it was this crime fighter here , officer lomax ... ... who tracked down the bang family and wouldn't rest until justice was served .
so really , we're just witnesses to his sting operation .
yeah !
what she said .
is that true , officer lomax?
did you engineer this collar?
well , i don't want to gloat , senator , but i think " mastermind " ... ... might be a more appropriate choice of words .
i love you .
just a second .
i assume that wasn't the speech you intended to give this afternoon .
not exactly , but ...
no .
no .
it wasn't .
but you should have heard the real one .
it was amazing , and i know this , because i heard her practice it 1000 times .
and trust me , she would have won this thing hands down .
i'm sorry today didn't work out the way you planned .
see , i thought today was about the speech , the fellowship ... ... my academic future .
but instead , it was about something much more important .
it just took me a few wrong turns to see it .
that was something else , wasn't it?
honey , i loved it .
i loved it !
yes .
you gotta ...
come on .
gotta give it up for the cats !
who let the cats out?
get your hands where i can see them .
who let the cats out?
you're not even a real cop .
zip it , odd job .
thanks to you , that's all gonna change .
let me do it .
so you're not mad?
are you kidding?
i can't believe what you did for me today .
listen ...
i want to apologize ... ... for saying the things i said earlier .
it's just ... ... i was having a meltdown .
everything was going wrong .
that's because every time i tried to fix it , it got worse .
the point is ... ... we haven't spent the day together in a really long time ... ... and i've really missed you .
i've missed you too .
and i'm so , so sorry if i ever made you feel ... ... like you had to take mom's place .
she would have been really proud .
both of us .
it was really great bumping into you today .
maybe we could bump again .
did i just say that?
yeah .
yeah .
and i'm glad you did .
so how about you just give me a call?
okay .
yeah .
jane ryan?
bye .
bye .
allow me to introduce myself .
my name is hudson mcgill .
listen , i am so sorry about everything that happened today ...
you know what?
i think you handled yourself really well today , considering everything .
the mcgill foundation would be really honored ... ... if you would represent us at oxford university next year .
but ...
i don't understand .
i found these .
this would have been an amazing speech .
it's not just that you wanted to win ... ... it's that you absolutely refused to fail .
and you didn't .
you deserve this fellowship , jane .
you really do .
congratulations and good luck .
thank you .
can you believe it?
i'm so happy .
i don't ...
thank you .
no , thank you .
one , two , three , four !
hey .
hi .
so have you given any thought to visiting me in london?
yeah .
yeah , i'm not gonna be able to visit you .
it's not gonna work out for me .
sorry .
it's okay .
i mean , your whole life's here .
i get it .
jane , i'm playing .
i'm moving .
i'm actually transferring schools there next year .
really?
seriously?
are you excited?
yeah .
i've got this great idea for the video .
it's , like , roxy , and she's dressed as a cucumber , and ...
well , maybe i should just be happy that i'm going to london on tour with you guys ... ... and keep these thoughts to myself .
agreed .
open up !
police !
cut it , guys .
cut it .
sorry to break up the party here , kids .
but you see , i got this little vw bug parked out there in a loading zone .
license number 2 quilted laxative 4 santa kansas limerick .
where's roxanne ryan?
you've got to be kidding me .
i am .
i just stopped by to wish you bon voyage ... ... and maybe get an autograph .
of course you may , officer lomax .
thank you , ma'am .
hey , lggy pop , crank the juice on that half stack , and let's hear what this band can do !
you heard him .
let's roll the guitars .
nice work , son .
