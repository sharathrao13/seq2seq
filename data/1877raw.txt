the crew hasn't even made it to the arena yet .
that's not good .
i don't know what they gonna do .

no .
they're all on .

well , that could work .
hey .
we're all set for the morning .
we have to be at the dock at 8 : 30 .
did you have a little shower?
yes .
great .
i'm so glad i made you bring this .
there's gotta be thundershowers tomorrow night late .
looks like it's gonna be crowded in the boat tomorrow .
i hope it's not a cattle boat .
we'll just do our own thing .
did you ask?
no .
they seem pretty relaxed .
why is it so hot here?
air conditioner is blasted .
figures .
we didn't come for the room .
that's for sure .
considering how much time we had to put this whole thing together ,
i'm amazed if we got anything .
i'm not complaining .
yes , you are .
alright , i'm done .

no .
i'm on vacation , remember?

his face !
you too .
yeah .
it's different .
i'm a girl .
yeah?
yeah .
so how are you?
fine .
a little stressed .
still i guess .
it's about work?
yeah , work , life .
maybe i can get you to think of something else .
you ok?
i might not be in the mood .
just thought like you might be a second ago .
could go either way , i guess .
maybe i need to give you a little nudge .
yeah , i'm not in the mood .
that wasn't the direction i was trying to nudge you in .
sorry .
i'm just tired .
it's been a long day .
we can talk .
nah , you are right .
we should get some sleep .
i'm wiped .
very funny .
all right , ladies and gentlemen ...
welcome aboard the world famous " reef explorer " .
my name's davis .
i'm going to be one of the guides on board our vessel today .
also driving your boat with , huh , linda and junior .
junior is gonna be the next guide on board our vessel .
we are going to be knocked to a dive site called " magic kingdom " .
now things you want to look for down there on this dive : spotted eels , spotted morays , enough of stingrays in the sand , there's angelfish , parrot fish , tropical fish , barbed beauties ...
is there any big fish like sharks or anything?
yeah .
we're going out to the open ocean , so chances are you probably might see a shark or three .
but , you know , like i tell everybody who see a shark , if you don't want to see it , close your eyes .
no problem .
sharks over here are not very aggressive towards human beings , so therefore you don't really have to worry about sharks .
ok .
ok , that's enough guys .
enjoy the ride out .
ok , guys .
i need to have your attention for just a few minutes .
we are going to be entering the water in a minute .
once that everybody has entered their gear , what we want you to do is a buddy system to enter the water first .
once that buddy systems are in the water , we are going to have guided divers , and myself , linda , and junior , is gonna help you guys get into water .
linda is on surface support , so if you surface in a distance away from the boat ,
you want to let her know that you are ok .
you start to let her know you are ok by giving her a big " o " over your head .
if you are not ok , you do the international distress signal .
the international distress signal is simple , very easy to do .
help !
ok?
all right?
very easy , very simple .
once everybody's in the water ,
i want you to make your way to the white float ball .
the white float ball is at the stern of the boat .
we want you to huh ...
may i sit there?
excuse me .
i'm sorry .
go ahead .
i'm sorry .
is that your mask?
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
you didn't bring your mask?
i brought it .
i don't know what happened .
it was supposed to be here .
sorry , sorry everybody .
i'm just , you know ...
anxious to dive .
i don't wanna ...
do you have extra masks on the ...
linda , did you bring an extra mask?
you have an extra mask , linda?
no , i don't have an extra mask .
junior?
anyone?
does anyone have an extra mask?
no .
you can't dive without a mask .
yeah , i understand that .
thank you , travis .
davis , davis .
i'm sorry guys .
go on .
alright guys .
the dive is going to be at a maximum drop of 60 feet , so ...
therefore , we are going to be down there for about 35 minutes .
you are ready?
yeah .
are you ok?
yeah , i'm ok .
i can't equalize my ears .
ok .
are you going to report to the guardian , trying to get equalized?
i don't think i can go down .
alright , do me a favor .
inflate your bc , put the regulator in your mouth and swim back towards the platform .
ok .
up , stand up , stretch your knees up .
how was it down there?
i didn't get down .
you didn't .
why not?
what happened?
i can't get my ears equalized .
you feel all right?
yeah , i'm good .
thanks .
you mind if i borrow this?
is it ok?
i'll bring it right back .
save some time .
yeah?
sure .
thank you .
god bless you .
i love you .
are you going down now?
yeah , linda , i'm going down .
hallelujah .
the only problem i have is you don't have a buddy right now .
i don't need a buddy .
i've dived all my life .
unfortunately you do if you're on our boat , sir .
your boat .
give me a break .
find a buddy for me .
someone down there's coming back up .
can you dive with me?
unfortunately , if i don't find you a buddy , i can't let you go , sir .
i love high water .
i'm diving in the finest .
help me .
come on , dive .
what's your name?
brian .
are you ready to go , brian?
we're set .
see?
i got a buddy .
all set .
sir , your regulator .
regulator .
yes , sir .
yeah , got one of those .
have a good time .
thank you .
there's a place in heaven for you .
i love you .
thank you .
it was great , man .
yeah , i'm good .
you good?
yeah .
thanks buddy .
i appreciated .
thanks a lot .
you are an angel .
i needed that .
did you see that shark down there?
yeah .
did everybody enjoy their dive?
yeah .
that's good .
have we got everybody?
daniel , where is the boat?
it's a good question .
i guess it's one of those .
you gotta be kidding me .
it better be one of those .
but which one do you think?
i don't know .
did you get us lost?
no .
so we are in the right spot?
yes .
i'm 90 % sure .
90 %?
why only 90 %? 'cause the boat is not here .
there is a coral head exactly 42 feet below us .
i marked it on the way down .
yeah .
i can still see the stocks .
the stocks?
yeah , there's three prawn , like a forked thing right below us .
you are unbelievable .
you can still find some of those little coral formation in the middle of the ocean , but you get lost going to my mother's .
i need an incentive .
you love my mother .
they obviously cannot see us .
you think it's time to swim?
swim where?
i don't know .
i think ...
that one is the closest .
honey , it's a bad idea .
why?
because we are not sure that's our boat .
and if it's not our boat ,
that means we could swim farther from our boat .
besides , you know how far away that is?
it's really far .
it's farther than that .
and if it's not our boat , they can pull away at anytime .
and our fucking boat , wherever the hell it is , will have a hell of time trying to find us .
you're going somewhere?
just my face .
i hate to tell you this , but ,
i didn't see anything that looks like any kind of coral formation .
could you just show me?
i'd just feel better .
sure?
see it?
cause i don't see anything .
shit !
what?
you don't see it , because it's not there .
so does that mean ... ... that since we've surfaced , we're drifting .
oh , shit .
but what does that mean?
should we swim?
goddam it .
we wasted all this time .
honey i hate to tell you this , but swim or not , we're going where this current decides .
are they moving?
hey !
yes .
oh god .
please let this be them .
it's gotta be , right?
yes .
they're coming right this way .
yep .
you realize that's a distress signal .
we are in distress .
daniel , did you just pee?
yep .
you're so disgusting .
you said you are a little cold .
daniel , was that a shark?
maybe , or a dolphin .
if it was a dolphin , you'd be on your way over there to play with it , so you obviously think it was a shark .
that's all we need right now .
that's ok .
you were patting a shark less than an hour ago .
please , that was nothing but a big old catfish .
it was more than two hours ago .
you know , now i'm starting to really get cold .
it's ok .
oh , jesus christ !
i thought he said they never come that close .
they also said the boat would be here .
it's gone .
it was probably just curious .
a couple of bodies floating up in the middle of nowhere ,
i'm sure it's not something it sees everyday .
oh , daniel .
where the hell are they?
oh , you gotta be kidding me .
it makes me feel better .
but what do we do if it comes back?
i don't know .
do we splash?
do we stay still?
you are the one who watches " shark week " .
first of all , we should be in a cage .
no , we should be on land .
sharks are attracted to wounded fish .
ok .
so i guess you just not splash around too much .
just sort of ...
stay still?
try to stay still .
oh , god .
ok .
i can't stand not knowing if it's under me .
i'm just gonna look , ok?
ok .
okay .
katharine hepburn and nick nolte in " grace quigley " and nick nolte and john malkovich in " mulholland falls " .
how's that for a quick .
always quick .
all right .
it's your turn .
i , hum ...
you know , i really don't feel like playing .
okay .
feel hungry?
of course .
i'm starving .
ouch !
shit !
what?
something just bit me here ...
what?
where?
i don't know .
it's right down by my ankle .
oh , god .
it kills .
goddam it !
it burns !
i don't see anything .
did it get you?
yes !
what is it?
i don't know , but the fucker really stung me .
it hurts .
let's get the hell out of here .
okay .
i think we are away from them .
is that far enough?
anything?
you got anything?
no .
damn , those fuckers stung .
i know .
where did it get you?
on my ankle , on my leg .
through your wet suit?
i don't know .
i guess so .
so are you ok?
no .
i'm not ok .
are you ok?
we find our boat , we'll be ok .
oh , come on , honey .
i know , i know , i know .
i'm sorry .
it really sucks , but we're going to get through this , ok?
ok .
i know i know .
god , okay .
i've just never heard of anything so fucked up in my entire life .
who's ever heard of two people getting
left in the middle of the ocean before?
i have actually .
you have?
yeah .
where?
dive magazines .
it's a lot more common than you think .
well , thanks for telling me when we got certified .
over there .
oh , my god .
oh , daniel .
oh , god .
please , please , please , let just be them .
oh , god .
i don't even care if it's not them .
just please see us and pick us up .
i don't think they can see us .
wish we had more sun .
they can't see us .
i know .
they are leaving .
yeah .
stay close .
what if they don't know we're missing?
there's no way .
they took a head count on the boat .
i saw it .
our stuff is on board .
we have their tanks .
and we know we've drifted .
it may take them a while , but they will find us .
i hate to tell you , but i think my dramamine is running off .
you're getting nauseous?
yeah .
honey , i could kill those fuckers .
i know .
it's just all this going up and down of the weights , i think .
you're probably getting dehydrated .
yeah?
but we can't drink the water , right?
no .
i should've told you that before .
you didn't , did you?
a little .
honey , stop .
it will give you diarrhea , and make you even more dehydrated .
great .
shark week "?
disasters at sea " , history channel .
i guess this means i have to stop complaining about you watching so much television .
but i didn't know i might get something out of this .
i'm really , really not feeling well .
oh , man .
you think maybe if i took my weights out . then it wouldn't pull on me so much?
just keep the belt , drop the weights .
you'll see'em try to charge us for those .
oh , hey .
we should put our gloves on .
how are your stings?
still there .
they're the one thing i think the salt water is actually helping .
this glove isn't helping them .
i don't feel very good .
why don't you lay back for a little bit?
yeah?
yeah .
just lay back .
i'm sorry .
it's ok .
i got you .
just relax .
ok .
there you go .
ok .
just for a few minutes .
just relax .
close your eyes .
daniel , i have to pee .
ok .
it's gonna be warm for a minute .
thanks .
daniel !
oh , god .
daniel !
daniel !
susanne !
daniel , i'm over here .
susanne !
oh , thank god .
it's ok .
i got you .
oh , my god .
what happened?
i don't know .
are you all right?
i'm fine .
you ok?
what happened?
where did you go?
i must have fallen asleep and we drifted apart .
jesus .
i'm sorry .
you scared the hell out of me .
i'm so sorry .
it's ok .
i'm glad you are here .
oh , my god .
it's ok .
how long are we sleeping?
god , i'm so out of it .
jesus , we've been in the water for 7 hours .
daniel , i feel something on my leg .
what?
i don't know .
it hurts .
it's your sting?
the wrong leg .
oh , my god . it really hurts .
we just try to keep ...
i don't see anything .
i can't either .
it's on the back .
i just can't tell .
hurt all over the whole thing .
just leave it alone .
ok?
don't tap it .
i'm not touching it .
well , something is touching it .
it's not me , honey .
i'm not here .
my hands are all here .
something is tapping on it .
i will take a look .
jesus .
oh , god .
i feel sick .
i'm sorry , honey .
i threw up .
fish gotta eat too .
speaking of which , the thing patting at your leg , is just a little cleaner fish .
what about my leg?
a little cut .
how could it get cut?
i don't know .
maybe you rub it against my knife over sleeping , or something .
oh , come on .
it wasn't a shark , was it?
no , honey .
are you sure?
no .
if it was a shark , your leg would be gone .
great .
and most , it was a teeny little barracuda just checking to see if you tasted good .
oh , god .
is it deep?
no , it's not deep .
let's swim out this puke .
ok .
come on .
that's far enough , you think?
yeah .
oh , baby .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
rinse your mouth a little bit .
yeah .
just don't swallow any , ok?
spit it back out .
can still feel that tapping .
what , the fish?
yeah .
try not to focus on this .
relax .
here you go .
what is it?
are you ok?
it's leg cramp .
can i help you?
is there anything i can do?
i got it .
ouch !
we are really falling apart , aren't we?
oh , god .
oh , honey .
oh , god .
they're gone .
they're gone .
jesus , daniel .
what kind are they?
the big ones .
i'm serious .
are they the bad kind?
i have no idea .
oh , my god .
no , no , no .
be still .
don't splash around .
oh , my god .
this can't be normal .
honey , oh , honey .
i don't know what is worse , seeing them or not seeing them .
seeing them .
unbelievable .
this is truly un fucking believable .
the best part is that we paid to do this .
we paid to be out here .
we paid those incompetent fuckers to drop us out in the middle of the fucking ocean .
we wanted an ocean view .
boy , did we get it?
you feel better?
i wouldn't exactly call it better .
you finished yelling?
that could be .
oh , good .
you're not the only one stuck out here , you know .
what?
are you mad at me?
no .
why?
because i was yelling?
no .
fine .
you be mad .
it's a great vacation , honey , isn't it?
so now we entered no talking phase , uh?
could you maybe answer one last question?
has this somehow over the hours become my fault?
let's just drop it .
of course .
you believe what you want to believe .
but i know for certain that we were in the right spot .
it's not just a matter of being in the right spot .
it's being there on time .
we were on time .
we were early .
he said 10 : 30 .
do we always have to get it so close?
for god's sake ,
why don't we stay with the group?
we always have to do things different than everybody else .
we shouldn't have spent so much time with that god damn eel .
well , that's a nice touch , adding " we " .
especially since you wanted have nothing to do with that fucking eel .
do you honestly , seriously , honey ,
do you honestly think that we got left behind because we were late?
i'm serious .
do you have any idea how idiotic that sounds?
oh , so now i'm an idiot .
we are where we are , aren't we?
yes , fine , because of me .
you refused to swim .
my god .
there were boats all around us .
you refused , and now , look , look around us .
we are stuck in the middle of the ocean .
with nobody .
even if we had been swimming for the last five hours ,
we would not be any closer to a boat than we are now .
the only reason we are even out here in the first place , is because of your fucking job .
what?
if it were not for your job ,
we would not have thrown out our plan out of the window ,
rush around the last minute , and
settled on this fucking trip .
we would be at home , in the middle of our hectic lives , which right now sounds like heaven to me .
and in a month's time , as we planned seven , seven months ago , we would be where we were supposed to be in the first place , and paying less than we are now to be shark bait .
oh , damn it .
i can't even believe you bring all that up right now .
you were the one that picked the dates .
yeah , out of my whopping two choices , this was the better date .
i wanted to go skiing .
oh , god .
i can't believe how far we've drifted .
you think the current will take us over there?
hopefully .
how's your leg?
it's ok .
you know , hurts a little bit , but it ... it's ok .
all right , let's go for it .
i love you .
i love you .
we are gonna be fine .
other people going to vacations , they spend their days just laying around , eating and drinking .
that sounds pretty good right now .
actually that could .
this'll be the story we'll be telling for the rest of our lives .
daniel .
what?
look .
wait .
oh , my god .
wait .
they are five of them .
look .
hold on .
where those comes from?
you know how dry my mouth gets when i'm diving ,
i wanted put them in the dive's bag but you had it , so i stuffed them in here at the last minute .
oh .
never thought anything could taste so good .
just hold me for a second , ok?
i gotta make sure we don't lose these ones .
i got you .
ok .
you're done?
yeah .
what is it?
you are all right?
oh , my god .
i don't see it .
are you ok?
i don't know .
i'm bit .
oh , my god , honey .
i'm bit .
the fucker bit me .
ok , hold on .
i'm gonna look .
oh , god .
it fucking hurts .
daniel , breathe , ok?
stay right here .
i'm gonna look .
ok?
i'm gonna go look .
you keep breathing .
daniel , listen to me .
i'm going to go look .
you breathe .
i'm breathing .
ok .
stay where you are .
i can't see .
my leg is still there , right?
i can feel it .
ok .
it's all right , honey .
you gotta put something on it .
ok .
it's bleeding .
it's bad , isn't it?
it's bad .
no .
it's not that bad .
ok , i'm going to tie something around it .
just keep breathing for me , ok?
i'm breathing .
god , it fucking hurts .
i'll put my weight belt tethering around it .
you wait .
this can't be happening .
how could this be happening .
i got bitten by a shark .
we could actually be eaten alive by shark out here .
we don't know anybody who's ever been bitten by a shark .
there are always three or four guys there on the shark show .
hey , it's all right .
it's not that bad .
it's going to be fine , ok?
you are going to have a nice scar to show your friends and that's it .
ok?
look at me .
look at me , baby .
that's right .
you are fine .
you are not that bad .
just hurts right now .
the salt water will make it get better
it's ok .
just hold on .
just breathe .
it's ok that it hurts .
oh , god .
something is trying to get to my foot .
it's a big one .
i love you .
stay still .
stay where you are .
it's gonna be ok .
you hold on .
you hold on , daniel .
you don't leave me out here , by myself .
you promise me you'll hold on .
my leg !
daniel !
hello?
hello?
it's the manager .
hello?
so what's the final weight on it?
2 . 13
give me a knife .
how's that?
good?
that's what it ate .
check it out .
man , they really do eat anything .
i wonder if it works .
