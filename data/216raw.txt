thanks for shooter . com . cn !
enjoy your hours !
for weeks , rumors have spread across mars ... from outposts to settlements ... from town to town .
something that had been buried for centuries has just been uncovered .
and as this mysterious force moves across the southern valley ... it leaves behind only silence ... and death .
take your seats , please .
i just talked with the cartel .
they're concerned that the rumors are getting out of control .
they'd like to make a statement in two hours .
some of you may not know we've had another incident .
at 1 520 hours yesterday , a freight train ...
trans mariner is 74 yankee ... returned from the southern valley on autopilot .
get to your security stations now !
let's move .
initial reports indicated it was a ghost train .
it appeared no one was aboard ... until a single survivor was discovered in the rear compartment .
call for a med tech backup .
lieutenant melanie ballard ... second officer , first squad of escort police .
they were assigned to transfer a prisoner ... from the jail at shining canyon mine back here to chryse .
lieutenant ballard was taken to hospital under guard .
she had superficial wounds , but was in otherwise good physical condition .
however , traces of an illegal substance , tetramonochloride ... were found in her system .
bring her in , please .
lieutenant ballard , please be seated .
do i get a lawyer , or don't police officers have rights these days?
representation by counsel won't be necessary .
your rights are protected by the matronage .
you can speak freely .
then i'm not being charged?
sit down , lieutenant .
this is a discovery hearing ... and your presence is required as ranking officer .
i want your after action report .
where's the rest of your team , the prisoner you picked up?
what happened at shining canyon?
last friday at 1 750 , we were slamming through a dust storm ... on the edge of the southern valley .
74 yankee was an ore hauler ... servicing the mines in the outer sector .
my squad was hitching a ride into shining canyon .
you beat me .
looks like you played tarts before .
no , i've never done this .
let's spin 'em again .
one down and one up .
fuck me !
the five of bats .
you got the wheel up .
what's your wager?
five bucks .
helena?
hey .
sorry .
weather station's tracking a huge storm across the southern sector ... and we're right under it by now .
what's the mark on it?
3, 200 kliks .
we should be there by 1 800 .
just let me know if you need anything .
you high?
fuck , helena , it's just clear .
i'll be straighter than this track long before we hit the canyon .
you better be .
this prisoner transfer is no sleepwalk .
we're picking up james williams .
you mean " desolation " williams?
cooling his heels in the shining canyon jail .
deep solitary .
what's the charge this time?
murder .
the man's been up on murder three times .
he gets off every time on self defense .
it's different this time .
sounds like he finally went psycho .
beaucoup corpses , all mutilated .
williams shows up at the mine with some bizarre ass story .
sends three officers to the medevac before they locked him down .
you starting to see the picture?
and all we got is you , me ... and this new guy jericho and a couple of rookies?
what do you think of sergeant jericho?
i was hoping we'd get a good , solid woman we could count on .
i don't know .
i guess we'll see .
well ...
i need you straight , melanie .
don't worry about that , commander .
i'm as straight as they come .
such a shame .
check on our transfer schedule .
shining canyon .
shining canyon , this is trans mariner is 74 yankee .
they ready for us?
this storm's really kicking up a mess .
i can't get through to the tower .
here's your coffee , mr. mcsimms .
three sugars and two whites .
just the way you like it .
you want some?
no , thanks .
how long?
about 40 .
shining canyon .
shining canyon , this is trans mariner is 74 yankee .
eta , 40 minutes .
everybody check your equipment .
i don't want any surprises .
is everything all right , lieutenant?
i couldn't help but notice that charming little scene with the queen bee .
yeah , well , you know how the service is , sergeant .
she figures if i want to make captain , i'll have to pay the price .
thing is , i don't give a damn about wearing another bar .
it could be that .
or maybe she just has good taste in women .
sergeant , you are seriously out of line .
i'd hate to spoil my record .
all right .
i know you think you're some pretty tough hombres .
you've had the best training .
you have the best gear .
you probably think this is some routine prisoner transfer .
but that's what i want to bang into your heads .
there's nothing routine about this prisoner .
we are here to pick up james " desolation " williams .
i want you all jack ready and double tough .
officers , you can disembark here .
what time is departure?
we need at least half an hour to secure our prisoner .
we got about a four hour turnaround ... and we'll be back at this spot at about 2200 .
you can re board any time after that .
see if you can raise the yard master , will ya?
ed?
ed , you out there?
rookies , use your breathers .
we're not gonna have air like earth for ten more years .
let's go .
god , i hate this thing .
you'll get used to it .
two years ago , we were still wearing full face breathers .
it takes about a month to get over the headaches out here .
so this is shining canyon?
god , what a dump .
first time in the boonies , rookie?
standard layout .
just another shitty boomtown like all the others .
seen one , you can go home .
you're always cold , you can't get a decent shower ... and they don't tell you that a one year contract here ... equals two years 'earth time .
you gotta read the fine print .
where is everybody?
yeah .
friday night , the place should be packed .
a whole 12 hours before sunup , and there's money to burn ... whores to fuck and drugs to take .
instead , we got a graveyard .
maybe they're all inside , spending their money .
mel , i'll get us squared away at the rec fac .
you and sergeant jericho check in at the jail .
save some hot water for me .
where were you before chryse?
utopia .
it's the ass end of the universe .
a penal camp full of work amnesty cutthroats .
sounds nasty ... but you seem to be holding together all right .
what you see is nothing .
i have numerous hidden talents .
need some help with that?
you're persistent , aren't you?
i've changed a few minds in my time .
there's not many of us breeders around .
i'd hate to miss a chance to give it a go .
what do you say?
hello !
anybody here?
officer to front desk .
well , hello , mr. williams .
no one seems to be about .
what do you make of it?
i don't know .
do you want me to pop the lock and ask the prisoners?
what do you mean , pop the lock?
that's a level eight security door .
i've got a mystical way with locks and mechanical objects .
there isn't a machine on mars that doesn't love me .
how about we check with the commander first?
so what do you do for fun then?
are you a gambler?
no .
i'm short time , sergeant .
i believe in saving my money .
don't worry about that .
i was gonna do it for free .
let me put it this way .
maybe i'd sleep with you if you were the last man on earth .
but we're not on earth .
it's a voltage overload , most likely .
you want to check it out?
it's probably nothing .
but on second thought
police officer .
anybody there?
shit !
this is not making me happy .
it's time to get backup .
jesus christ .
what are you doing?
i almost killed you .
what's going on?
rec fac's a slaughterhouse .
what?
slaughterhouse?
that's the word descanso used .
i didn't see it myself .
according to what commander braddock told me ... right after we first arrived in shining canyon ... she and the two rookies headed towards the recreation facility .
mel , i'll get us squared away at the rec fac .
you and sergeant jericho go and check in at the jail .
save some hot water for me .
descanso , sweep left .
bashira , stick with me .
officer to train , do you read?
the casino , barracks , dining hall , rec center , no one alive anywhere .
commander .
what?
i can't reach the train .
well , keep trying .
how are we doing?
i don't know .
this thing was built to stay locked .
and williams is still locked up?
what do you mean?
williams was arrested on the suspicion of murdering ... six rail workers and a payroll courier up at klik 305 hub station .
the bodies were hung and decapitated , just like the bodies in the rec fac .
so how'd they pin that on desolation?
he showed up here with the courier's payroll .
the cashier realized it was a stolen scrip .
they made the arrest .
there's got to be a day log here somewhere .
sergeant's desk .
here .
last night the mine called in a work stoppage .
reported winds gusting up to 60 knots .
sixty?
that's what it says .
anything else?
arrest for theft , then nothing .
got it .
what's going on around here?
we haven't had a meal or a piss break in six hours .
descanso , open the door .
all right , everybody , answer " here " when i call your name .
akooshay .
what?
just answer " here .
yeah .
zimmerman .
i'm right in front of you .
benchley .
who's that?
she showed up last night .
checked herself in .
insisted on being locked up here with us .
well , wake her up , sunshine .
let's see what she has to say .
somebody wants to talk to you .
who are you?
whitlock .
what are you doing in the holding tank , whitlock?
it's the only safe place at the moment , okay?
can i go back to sleep now?
no , you can't !
i need answers .
what's going on out there?
what's your i. d.?
dr. arlene whitlock .
i'm the spec six science officer ... in charge of the mining operation at drucker's ridge .
i left drucker's about a week ago with a weather balloon i'd modified .
there was a disturbance in town .
it seemed prudent to get out .
they said there was a riot and the place was destroyed .
yeah , something like that .
i was adrift for several days , you know .
ran out of food .
i followed the railroad tracks until i got here .
oh , shit .
then the storm forced me too low .
i hit a windmill and crashed .
and they were kind enough to take me in here .
well , wasn't that nice of them .
mel, jericho , go check out williams .
see if he knows anything about this .
williams , do you know what's going on outside?
are you aware of what's going on outside?
let's go .
this asshole doesn't know anything either .
you got some balls , calling him an asshole to his face .
that's desolation williams .
i heard he took out at least six when they cornered him at deimos station .
and this is eight inches .
you men love to exaggerate .
just goes with the territory .
yeah , well , in my case , it's a bit different .
perhaps a connoisseur like yourself would appreciate what i have to offer .
go get the commander .
disarm her .
officer .
it was almost like she was ... possessed .
like there was some kind of force inside her .
who was she?
she was a dispatch officer .
we tried to make her comfortable .
the rookies took her to a storage room in the back of the jail .
then the commander and i went back outside to look around town .
what do you think?
that the science officer is lying .
tell me again about williams .
i didn't read the full file .
caught him with the money , but he said he didn't kill anybody .
course .
they all died off right .
then cut their own heads off?
put down your weapon !
put it down !
call jericho .
sergeant jericho , we need backup !
we're 20 southwest of the rec fac .
don't open the door !
don't let it out !
who goes there?
i can't fight it !
it's in me !
commander braddock !
there's a man in there .
open it .
the lock is destroyed .
i gonna need a cutting torch .
how long?
at least half an hour , maybe more .
what the fuck is going on here?
he committed suicide .
before he slit his throat , he yelled something ... something like , " stay away !
don't open the door .
stay away .
and now the commander's gone .
maybe he was contagious .
or crazy .
i don't know .
i say we take him at his word and leave him locked in .
look , one of us has to stay with the rookies .
why don't you go back to the jail?
i'll find the commander .
let's get the hell out of this place .
there's nothing we can do for this guy .
you're right .
okay , let's go .
drop the weapon before i cut this dyke bitch head off ! .
what the fuck happened?
bashira let him out for some food .
let me guess .
you unshackled him .
what do you want , williams?
i wanna get the fuck out of here .
we'll let you walk .
just let the girl go .
you think i'm falling for that shit?
i can't let you take the rookie .
take me , okay?
put the gun down .
put 'em down !
drop your gun , descanso .
yeah , drop the gun , descanso .
relax !
take it easy !
just relax , relax .
you'll get what you want .
i know i'll get everything i want .
now let's go .
damn girl , i like you already .
shit .
you okay?
just swell .
where's williams?
he took off out the air lock .
he went into the clinic .
i saw him go in not even two minutes ago .
let me guess .
he's got your shotgun , right?
couldn't help it .
he was too fast .
he's still in there though .
i can see the back door from here .
all right , you two take the back door .
i'll go in front and flush him out .
if he comes at you , shoot to kill .
now what?
how the hell did that happen?
let's go .
wait a minute .
looks like you're coming with me now .
you see what's going on out there .
you know i didn't kill nobody .
i said move it .
i ain't going nowhere .
i just saved your life .
you should let me go .
and i saved yours .
looks like we're even .
now move it !
let me ask you something .
if you're so innocent , how come we found all that stolen flash on you?
i didn't say i was innocent .
i said i didn't kill nobody .
okay , let's say i believe you .
what exactly happened at k 305?
i don't know .
i was just changing trains from camp sinai .
had a little time to get me something to eat ... so i went into the station .
it was just lying there , so you took it .
you would have done the same thing .
see , that's where you're wrong .
i'm a cop , not a crook .
it's a thin line between a cop and a crook these days .
you think it's a big difference between you and me?
you just got the woman behind your bullshit .
look at you .
you look high right now .
you know i saved your life out there .
so why don't you save mine and let me out of here?
look ... my job is to bring you back to chryse to stand trial .
i don't think you did it .
but that's not my call .
so let's not make this any more complicated than it has to be .
yeah , it's gonna be real complicated .
you can believe that shit !
i ain't going back !
so you secured your prisoner .
where was your commanding officer during this time?
i can only report what sergeant jericho told me later .
after the man in the rover committed suicide ...
jericho went looking for the commander .
let's get the hell out of this place .
there's nothing we can do for this guy .
yeah , you're right .
let's go .
commander braddock !
lieutenant , we got a situation here .
sergeant , you're breaking up .
i can hardly hear you .
the commander's dead .
everybody in the mine has gone insane .
jericho , can you read?
hey , come on !
let us out of here !
start at the beginning !
i told you .
i got here last night .
don't bullshit me !
lieutenant !
what the hell is going on out there?
what?
in semiarid regions on earth , there are certain organisms ... that live in small pools that are formed by the annual rains .
when the pools dry up , those organisms can't live .
but they don't die either .
they go dormant below the surface ... away from the hot sun until the next rain cycle begins .
then they reemerge .
i think something like that is happening here .
i don't understand .
whatever used to live here , we woke it up .
it takes us , okay?
i'm talking about a kind of possession .
lieutenant , sergeant jericho is on the radio .
he said he found three people out there .
they're on their way in and they got an eta of five minutes .
you should get on the radio and talk to him .
he's found three people?
that's what he said .
you okay?
no .
something broken?
i'm all right .
but it's out of the body now .
yeah , it's loose in here .
lieutenant , sergeant's on the radio .
lieutenant , we 're coming in .
can you read me?
sergeant , where are you?
we 're right down the street .
we?
who's we?
i found three people alive out here .
come on .
open the door for us .
i tried to reach you on the radio .
just you make sure that door is locked .
there must be 200 of them fucking freaks ... and any minute now they'll be coming to kick our ass .
okay , relax .
who are these guys?
i found them hiding up in the mine shed .
lieutenant , we got a situation here .
sergeant , you're breaking up .
i can hardly hear you .
the commander's dead .
and everybody in the mine has gone insane .
check the window !
they didn't see him .
they're gone .
who are you?
who are we?
who are you?
the man asked you a question .
my name's jericho .
at least he's not one of them .
what's happening out there?
who the fuck are those clowns?
what are they all sparked up about?
used to be miners .
then everybody in this place lost their mind .
running around , chopping people's heads off .
ease up , man .
we were up on the rim when they called a work stoppage .
what are they doing?
shit , i don't know .
look at that .
they're knocking off early for the night .
how will we sneak in on a shift change if they knock off early for the night?
shut up !
what the hell is that?
let's get the hell out of here !
we hid till the storm was over .
later , i went out to take a look around .
i thought they were all dead .
then some of them started to come to .
they walked around like they were confused or lost .
a few of them seemed okay .
they was trying to help the others .
then they started changing .
what do you mean?
they act different , stand different .
start cutting on themselves for decoration .
filing their teeth .
making weapons .
killing the ones who hadn't changed .
cutting people's faces off and wearing them for masks .
you lads got any weapons?
i mean real weapons .
only cops can have guns .
there's some detonators in them cases over there .
do you know how these things work?
i know you need dynamite to use them .
okay , then .
we take our prisoner and we all get on the train .
and what prisoner would that be?
that doesn't concern you .
if it's desolation williams ... it concerns me very much .
now drop your weapon .
all of you !
weapons on the floor .
so only cops have guns , eh?
you fucking pricks .
we lied .
now go get williams .
i don't think so .
what was that?
fucking kill me .
no problem .
look , will you two stop fucking about?
lieutenant , let williams out .
give me one good reason .
i just gave you about 200 good reasons ... and they're probably outside right now .
it doesn't matter that williams is wanted for murder ... and it doesn't matter that this lot are scumbags .
what matters right now is that we stick together to get out of here .
all of us ... including williams , including them .
who are you calling scumbag , motherfucker?
now quit with all your fucking stalling and take us to williams !
i'll be goddamn .
finally .
man , this town done went crazy .
we had to improvise .
you like it?
i love it .
i want you to let him out .
what's up , d?
i'm still shackled .
what , are you pigs on a fucking break?
free him up .
i knew you'd let me go .
it's been a long time .
i didn't thinky'all could do it .
piece of cake .
it was my plan , desolation .
fuck !
i thought you was watching the door .
i was !
bitch , you better open this door .
i don't think so .
you don't open that door , i'm gonna blow your head off .
then your asses will never get out .
someone will find you sometime ... probably tied upside down in here with your heads cut off .
tell your dogs to quit barking so we can talk .
put 'em down .
put it down .
listen to me , williams .
we don't have a lot of time .
you need us and we need you .
we've all seen what's going on out there ... and none of us is gonna survive if we don't stick together .
i need you to give me your word ... that if i open this door ... you and your boys will stand by my command at all times .
i never give my word .
it's okay .
i never make deals with criminals either .
you got it .
what?
you making deals with cops?
and you are too .
give her your weapon .
everybody , give it up .
well , introduce us to your friends .
these my compadres .
uno must be the nice one .
you got that right , butchy .
i'm not as nice as desolation .
and i'll cut your fucking titties off .
who's in charge here?
you better let go of my arm .
who is in charge here?
you !
you !
shit !
so , you just gonna stand there and watch her break my shit .
yeah .
and now that you're done mopping the floor , get me a beer , killer .
what's next?
we get more deputies .
you're deputized .
consider this a martial law situation .
let's go .
when did this start?
it started a few minutes ago .
what should we do with him?
we can't take him with us .
then here he stays .
guys , what is that?
it's a laffer .
a black market breather .
it has a 1 5 percent nitrous mix .
it gets you high?
it turns your brain into swiss cheese .
one gross of detonators .
what are those good for?
it would help if we had some dynamite ... but they make a pretty good bang .
we could put them in some food cans or something , make some hand grenades .
all right .
you got ten minutes .
easy .
here .
let me do it .
that's beautiful .
that's what you get , dumb ass .
you're gonna be okay to do this?
all right , it's almost 2200 hours .
here's the plan , short and simple .
descanso and jericho take the lead .
everybody else follows .
it's about 50 meters from here to the station .
bashira and i are in the rear .
any questions?
put your hand down .
all clear .
let's do it !
hey , bro , i don't see no motherfucking train .
hey , lady .
we don't see no train .
it'll be here .
come on .
let's go .
that's the mine office .
what are they doing?
looks like they're tearing the whole town apart , building by building .
come on .
pick it up .
lieutenant .
hold your fire .
just keep on moving .
go !
where's the train?
i don't know .
you don't know?
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
lieutenant ballard to the train , come in .
plan a is fucked up .
you got a plan b?
yeah .
it's the same as plan a.
you got any fresh ideas?
yeah .
what we should have done in the first place .
shit !
come on , you mindless motherfuckers !
second time i saved your life .
run a tab .
jericho , grenade !
come on , man .
on your feet .
let's move .
shit .
open that door .
we sealed the air lock doors , and sergeant jericho dismantled the lock .
they couldn't open the door from the outside , so we were safe ... for a while .
get on the radio .
try to reach the train .
where's your brother?
he didn't make it .
oh , god .
uno was your brother?
yeah .
look at him .
whatever is inside of him has waited a long time to get out .
i didn't understand their design , how they move .
but it's got to be the wind .
yeah .
yeah , the wind takes them .
and then once their hosts die ... they drift along the railroad tracks from town to town , human to human .
what a perfect creation .
vengeance on anything or anyone that tries to lay claim to their planet .
what did you see at drucker's ridge?
i was at the mine when they called a work stoppage .
it was a section 740 , a " scientifically significant find .
a 740 applies to any number of things found on mars .
a biological organism , an indication of water , things like that .
after we dynamited the mountain , we discovered an entrance .
it was a tunnel carved into the rock .
it had been hidden underneath the outer walls for centuries ... and someone other than man had carved it .
jesus !
what the hell was that?
i don't know .
let's get the hell out of here !
it was me .
i opened pandora's box .
i let them out .
i contacted the train .
they're about three kliks north of town on a decoupling spur .
they said the tracks are blocked .
can they get through?
yeah , they're working on it .
you okay?
yes .
barricaded the rear door .
good .
there's a maintenance courtyard out the back enclosed by a five meter wall .
there's even a rover parked out there .
maybe we can make a run for it .
no , we wait .
bashira got in touch with the train .
they're coming back for us .
well , if a train coming , they better hurry up .
what's the matter with you?
you did good out there .
yeah , right .
it's a fucked up situation .
i never put too much faith in cops , but you did all right .
you trust me?
hell , no .
i really don't understand you at all , desolation .
the only one looking out for me is me .
doesn't that bother you?
nothing bothers me .
i stopped worrying a long time ago .
don't you believe in anything?
i believe in staying alive .
yeah , but for what?
stick around .
i might let you know one day .
when?
when the tide is high and the water's rising .
doing okay in here?
check this out .
what about it?
it's pretty solid .
one way in and a back door out , leading to the rear entrance .
a good sturdy door .
so what's your point?
it's rather cozy , don't you think?
i don't believe this .
you lured me back here to seduce me?
yeah , well , the way things are going ...
i thought this might be our last chance to to dance .
yeah .
fuck him , whatever the fuck he is .
it's out of him .
everyone go !
get out !
let's take her out back .
what the fuck do you mean?
we aren't moving her anywhere .
it's taking her over , man .
there's nothing we can do .
easy , man .
i lost a brother in this .
that's not her .
come on .
let's put her down before they hear us .
this belongs to her .
where did you get it?
i stole it .
do you know what it is?
it's her stash .
this will mess with anything in there .
bon voyage , mel .
let's get the hell back in here .
i will not .
i was aware of having ... thoughts ... or memories .
like i'd been invaded by something ... and it was trying to take me over .
something inside of me wouldn't let that other thing take over and i fought it .
i didn't know where i was at first , and then it hit me .
i was outside alone ... unarmed .
the back wall's been breached .
don't worry .
the back door's locked and secured .
let me in .
it's me .
shit ! it's melanie !
open the door !
looks like her to me .
i haven't heard any of these things speaking english .
come on , williams .
the tide's getting high out here .
give me those keys .
come on !
is it you?
yes .
it's me .
i had a glimpse of the martians ... of their minds , of what they want .
they won't rest short of the destruction of any invading species .
as far as they're concerned , we are the invaders .
something's kicking out there .
shit .
they made a battering ram .
everybody to the rear of the jail .
bashira , you and jericho go back to the storeroom .
load up on detonators .
you're the second line of defense .
we stay here?
we hold them off as long as we can , then we fall back to the storeroom .
soon as we kill one of them , whatever is inside is gonna come after us .
i know .
so if one of us gets possessed
leave 'em .
here we go .
party time .
i'm out .
i'm out .
clear !
move !
move !
clear !
clear !
clear !
stand clear !
clear !
get out !
i got it .
take them out back .
get out of here .
come on !
come on !
let's go !
look for the train .
see if you can get someone on the radio .
jericho , get this thing started .
whitlock , unlock the gate .
come on !
hurry up !
the train's at the station .
officer to train , do you read?
where the hell have you been?
where the hell have you been?
all right , bashira , come down .
all right , wait for us .
we're on our way .
let's go .
get in !
get yourselves ready .
oh , my .
come on !
come on !
let's go !
let's go !
come on !
come on !
okay , go !
go !
what the hell happened to you?
we got trapped a couple of kliks north of here , trying to off load .
i'll get us out of here .
we've got to go back .
slow the train down outside of town , then come to a complete stop .
no way .
i'm giving you an order .
i don't care .
the answer's no .
the answer's yes .
look ... even if we get back to chryse , those things will just keep coming .
we've got a chance here .
we've got a chance to stop this thing before it goes any further .
this is about one thing dominion .
it's not their planet anymore .
what about him?
isn't it our job to take him back?
is he still a prisoner or is he one of us?
i can give a damn about saving this planet .
seems like it's been after me since the day i was born .
if i'm gonna die , i'm gonna die fighting ... not running .
if we blew up the nuclear power station , what would happen?
i mean , there'd be a huge explosion , right?
no , not unless you retract the control rods and expose the core .
then what?
then you'd have a small atomic bomb going " boom .
how small?
i don't know .
it'd blow out a radius of a mile , maybe two .
would it kill them?
it would certainly destroy their human hosts , but as for them ...
i don't know .
jericho , can you get us in?
i can try .
the plan was simple .
sergeant jericho , the science officer and i jumped off the train ... and headed towards the powerplant .
the others stayed aboard the train as it backed into the station .
the idea was they provide cover ... and distract the martians as we set the charges in the plant .
they they'd swing back , pick us up and we'd all get as faraway ... from shining canyon as we could before the place blew .
like i said , it was a simple plan .
the only problem was , it didn't work the way it was supposed to .
how are you doing, jericho?
i'm working on it .
hurry up .
we've got to remove the water jacket and destroy the containment shell .
where do i put the dynamite?
officer to the train , they've spotted us .
get your ass back here now .
yeah?
let's go .
we've got to get out of here fast .
the doc says the blast radius could be up to two miles .
what does that mean?
it means step on it .
stay here and keep it full throttle .
what are you gonna do?
lighten our load .
i think there's some more dynamite in the rear car .
see you later , you big motherfucker .
you okay?
say your prayers .
i didn't know you was cut this deep .
should've taken care of this hours ago .
you do that like a pro .
yeah .
me and my brother been through a lot of battles ... ever since we was kids .
i never thought i'd go to war with somebody like you .
i know when you get to chryse , you'll tell those people that i helped you ... and i wasn't the cause of all this mess around here .
'cause i know they're looking for somebody to blame .
i swear to you , williams ... as soon as i get back , i'm gonna tell my superiors about this fucked up planet .
they'll drop the charges as soon as they get the report .
that ought to hold it .
when you get there , have somebody look at it .
i couldn't get it perfect , so it might leave a scar .
i'm getting a collection .
you'll be all right .
comfortable?
yeah .
i'll get you a blanket .
what the hell are you doing?
oh , this is where i get off .
what are you talking about?
we'll be in chryse soon .
can't let you turn me in .
i can't let you walk .
what you gonna do , fucking shoot me?
there's nowhere to run .
anywhere is better than hell .
catch you later .
yeah , right .
shit .
and what happened to williams?
i don't know .
when i woke up , he was gone .
and you were handcuffed?
must've done it while i slept .
at that point , i trusted him .
that's all you have to tell us?
that's all i know .
all right , lieutenant ballard , i suggest you get some rest .
you're dismissed .
is our statement to the cartel going to be that mars is being overrun by ghosts?
attention , all police personnel ... report to your nearest munitions station immediately ... for weaponry assignment .
a security breach has occurred in the south quadrant .
this is a level ten emergency .
allpolice personnel , report to your division sergeant for assignment .
all civilian personnel , evacuate the streets immediately .
please remain indoors until further instructed .
come on .
tide is up .
time to stay alive .
if you ever wanna come to the other side , you'd make a hell of a crook .
you'd make a hell of a cop .
let's just kick some ass .
