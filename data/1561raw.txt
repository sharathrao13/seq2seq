they played it this morning .
this morning?
yes at 5 . 15 when we're leaving for work .
it was so nice .
come on , play it once more .
they play it when we're asleep or when we're out ...
where is my comb?
where did i put it?
don't come here boss we're changing .
i've seen hundreds of bodies like yours !
not like mine !
he's used to his fancy bit .
she's got a big arse .
and he's got a big gut !
but that's all i've got left !
listen , there's a new trainee starting today , so watch your language in front of him !
i know your big mouths !
what do you take us for , boss .
has anyone seen this trainee , girls?
no .
i wonder what he looks like .
i bet he's just a kid !
he's only 16 if he is an apprentice .
nothing for us then .
don't worry peter , you'll soon learn , don't worry .
we are a self service store .
i'll tell you exactly how it works .
we have complete faith in our customers , we do believe them , in 100 % , you know .
but of course some of them will still from time to time steal something .
your job will be to keep an eye on our customers , and have your wits about you .
but they can't know that you are watching .
they mustrt know you're watching them .
nothing wrong in that !
you're just preventing those customers from stealing .
we're simply educating them !
look peter , i've never caught anyone while wearing a white coat ...
if the customer sees that coat , he knows you're part of the collective , so he's careful ... he's careful .
but without the coat you'd catch one or two magpies .
may i put it here?
of course you can , peter .
understand , peter?
so , okay .
yes .
peter , like i said already , this is not the way to do it .
you're tailing these people like a cop .
you peek in their bags .
they are not going to put anything they steal on top .
easy does it and be inconspicuous , do you understand?
i do .
so try it once again .
excuse me , i had a feeling that the man has just stolen something .
which one?
he's outside already .
so run after him , hurry up .
but i'm not sure that he has ...
it doesn't matter , go on .
where have you been?
where have you been?
at work .
at work?
yes .
i really was at work .
where?
at the shop , where else ...
do you know your boss?
of course .
so what was he doing here , looking for you?
i guess he doesn't know you then .
of course he does but something happened .
what?
i had the feeling one man stole something .
so i followed him .
i see ...
you were being a detective .
so you thought he'd stolen something .
so what did you do?
then i followed him around .
and that was all?
yeah .
what was the point of following him around?
did you identify him?
did you see what he took?
no i didn't .
and what would you've done?
i just followed him .
what would i've done?
i'd call somebody .
to stop and identify the man .
and search him .
but just to follow him around that makes no sense !
i tought he'd give himself away .
but how .
why didn't you get his name?
you can't do that .
why not?
i'd call a policeman or someone older and get his name .
you had the feeling he'd shoplifted .
yeah , but i wasrt sure .
then you should have stayed in the shop .
i couldn't .
i told about to our women and they said to follow him .
so i did .
why didn't you tell your boss?
what's the point to tell some women .
i mean the sales ladies .
i see .
so what was the final consequence , the final result?
nothing .
i just followed him all day .
you followed him .
so you werert at work?
but i was .
just for a while .
and what did you do after that?
so tell me .
just answer .
i went home .
did you?
so , you went home .
a bit early !
werert you supposed to go back?
why home?
how you dare?
or do you think everybody can just up and leave his job and go home?
there were many things in my life i didn't like .
but i had to face them , often against my will .
that's what made a man out of me .
that was that !
come on , dad , let it be .
peter is still a kid .
i'm not some little kid .
of course not !
and you should have realized that a long time ago !
here , let me warm it up for you .
forget it .
but it's cold .
it's alright .
it's not !
warm it up .
if you look around these shops nowadays , what do you see?
nothing but women .
no men ... they're as rare as goldust .
and in the end , what are the women good for?
they get married and the workplace is empty .
so who does it all depend on?
who stayed then?
men !
men .
put up with it for a year or two ... and then you'll be the boss .
you know what that means?
you'll be somebody !
it's just up to you ... to become that boss early !
god forbid there wont 'be another war .
as the saying goes ...
stay near the food to keep far from the grave .
but don't think about that .
don't think about that at all .
look .
on monday , you'll go back to work and apologize and everything will be allright .
understand?
do you understand?
when we were twenty you wanted my love
i was getting married but you went to the army .
when we were twenty you wanted my love
i was getting married ... ... or if there was a fire at least .
so you could go and put it out .
no , they've got plenty of firemen already .
don't look at me .
see , i'd just be saving lives if the fire was at night .
at night?
we'd haul the women out of their beds !
oh , yeah !
sure !
lmagine the flames licking pavla .
lucky flames .
see , now i pushed out all the air .
all the air pushed out .
but if my chest is up like this ...
it's like you expect what a girl wants to say ... and she's just got her breasts like this ...
how are pavla's breasts?
i don't know .
only mara knows , huh .
i don't know why she's going out with him .
he thinks he's so cool , but he's a bad influence on her .
i met them for many times walking by the river .
they go ... she goes ...
i'm standing there looking at her and she doesn't even glance at me .
i get the feeling i am not there .
but you are , you are .
i know .
you are a virgin .
yeah , yeah .
tell me , oh lovely maiden ...
a little higher !
why do you laugh?
not everybody can sing like you .
do you know that?
it's a parody of othello .
yeah .
now he leaves ...
my sweet othello , i love you so .
oh , my sweet othello , i do love you .
i declare my love for you !
i can't hear you .
louder !
oh , my sweet othello , i love you so .
now casio comes in ...
what?
who?
you never saw it?
no , did you?
i did .
good evening , my lovely lady , sorry to disturb you .
othello is to report to court immediately ...
othello is to come immediately ... cause two guards are fighting over their posts .
and he says goodbye to her and leaves .
now casio is alone with her ... and he says ...
i can't remember what he says , though .
listen .
what?
that isn't a very good song .
wait a little .
how does it go?
peter !
is peter here?
is he not here?
peter !
seems he is not here .
and it goes on .
your husband , my lady , is a great hero , and he loves you faithfully ...
what are you looking at?
i'm not looking , i'm thinking .
about what?
i can't tell you .
why not?
you'd think i had a dirty mind .
i already know that !
what?
not really .
what are you thinking about?
i really can't say .
i know it anyway .
so say it .
i can't .
come on , say it .
actually , there's nothing dirty about that , you know .
some girls wear swimsuits even tinier than mine .
and some little girls walk around totally naked .
true , but only the little ones .
yeah .
i really hate the girls who show off and then ...
come on , row !
go ahead and row !
i am rowing !
i can't see !
those girls are in my class .
what about those guys?
i don't know them .
some bums ...
get lost !
this is not a show .
her hair was all locks and curls ...
no !
that's wrong .
her hair was all she ever thought about .
stop , i beg you !
don't 'beg me .
it's like this ...
her hair was all locks and curls ...
when she stood by ...
but sing it all . ... by a window ...
her hair was all locks and curls ...
she didn't think about anything else .
so , do sing .
what are you looking at?
the grass .
why the grass?
green colour soothes the eyes .
that's why the cows are so calm?
sorry ...
i didn't mean it that way .
you bull .
look , those boys are staring at us .
so let them .
if i were them , i'd never run around in my boxers .
you can't help the way you look .
could you go out with them?
not really ...
why?
they're kind of weird .
that's what i think too .
and anyway , i don't know them .
do you know me?
they're coming over here .
just let them .
so do you know me?
look , they're coming and still staring .
it doesn't matter .
so do you know me?

we're bricklayers .
all bricklayers look like this .
i knew you were bricklayers , but the girls don't care for creamy legs .
watch you don't have creamy face !
i still think you look like bums .
bums can hit back hard .

i don't believe it .

you watch me .
and you watch me as well .
and when he gets back , tell him to watch me too !
does he always drink so much?
he doesn't .
i can see he's drunk .
it's because he likes a girl here .

and which one?
she is already left .
is that why he got drunk?
no , he got drunk before .

why didn't you tell her for him?
i can't .
i had hepatitis .
hepatitis , did you?

don't bother me , and go home to bed .
okay , i'll just sit down here for a moment , boss .
look , cenda ,
i like patting you on the back , when you deserve it , but you must understand , no one can praise you all the time , over and over again ...
i am sure you understand that .
it's sure thing ...
cenda ...
let him be .
this is the best for him .
good evening , mum .
hello , darling .

it seems there are more stains ...
you should take care of it .
it's your new suit .
are you hungry?
no , i'm not .
i can warm up the leftovers from lunch .
no .
well , tell me something .
how was it there?
nice .
which boys did you go with?
there was a crowd of us .
and were the boys fine?
not some hooligans , i hope .
no .
and were the girls there too?
so have you found yourself a girl yet?
no , you haven't .
it's good .
you've still got plenty of time .
and what do you boys drink?
just a lemonade .
do you?
really , nothing else .
don't tell me you don't take a beer .
who did you walk home with?
some other boys or alone?
alone .
and the boys stayed there?
are you deaf?
mum asked you something .
i had a lemonade , then we danced , then i came home .
nothing happened .
good night .
wait , wait .
look at this .
it's quite interesting .
it's about a boy like you .
they don't give him a name , that's not done anymore ...
but ...
but it's all true .
you can read it yourself .
it's something like ...
you're a man now , so you'll work it all out .
just read it !
i know it .
i read it already .
good night .
what every boy should know about his body
what are you doing , dear?
chopping noodles .
they're here already .
what are you going to tell him?
what should i say?
call him .
so , call him .
franta !
what do you want?
come here .
what do you want?
will you come here !
you come here .
go there .
so , you go .
what is it?
nobody else should hear this .
what do you have there?
some paintings .
so unwrap them .
they're for the shop .
what's on them?
maybe jan hus or jan zizka .
i told you this is for the shop .
i see .
what was on saturday?
i got a bit drunk .
bullshit .
it's true .
and what about her?
mara was there and ...
and what?
i got a date with her for today .
what time did you get home?
at about eleven .
and what did you do?
what ... all kinds of things .
and the tongue is a problem , eh?
well , yeah .
don't tell me you two kissed .
i've got a date with her today .
what about the sell by date on these?
i hope they're still allright .
and these oils here?
they have three more weeks to go .
good .
and these?
this is the latest delivery .
these should be completely fresh .
yes .
and they actually are .
good , it's good .
peter , what are you doing?
get the stuff in and shut the door !
now the cooking fats .
they are all fresh .
that's the last delivery , it's fresh .
thank you .
that's okay .
i've seen them .
now the rum .
two , four ... sixteen , eighteen bottles .
it says twenty one here .
that's yesterday's count .
so we've sold three since then .
here we've got the five star brand .
what are you doing !
don't be lazy !
don't cut that rope !
untie it !
we can always use rope !
so how many five stars?
two , four , six .
yes , six , that's fine .
and the pure spirits .
two , four , six , eight , ten .
ten , yes .
boss , please ...
that's fine , peter , that's fine .
paintings , paintings !
the toilet is blocked , our stepladder is busted , the fan hasn't worked for years .
cognac .
two , four , six , eight .
eight , that's right .
and rums?
three , six , nine ... thirty .
thirty one !
so we've sold one since yesterday .
boss !
well , that's good , peter .
bitter herb .
two , four , six ... nine .
yes .
here we have ...
the five star cognac .
from georgia !
two , four , six .
so six .
a painting has to be viewed from the distance .
i don't have the right glasses ...
good lord , it's beautiful .
look at her eyes , they're closed .
but she knows what she's doing .
make a little funnel , so those bottles stop distracting you .
look at where she has that hand !
no , no , that's perfectly normal .
look at the kid , look at him .
save a little bit for tomorrow !
what are you looking at?
if the women could go shopping naked , our hiring troubles would be over .
and you know it's a serious problem .
you can count the boys willing to work in a shop on your fingers .
they all want to be astronauts , engineers ...
and when we do get a man in here , he's surly defective .
let's go on to the wine .
all right .
so here is the sylvaner green .
two , four , six ... ten .
agreed .
then mostar .
three , six , nine ... eighteen .
that's right .
what did you have in the can't near the train station today?
i was carrying some paintings .
what you mean?
what paintings?
for the boss .
you see , for the boss , paintings .
who can buy paintings nowadays?
come on , dad ...
they were not really paintings .
they were more like prints ...
prints , prints .
it was a reward from headquarters .
you see , a reward .
well , reward .
what was on those paintings?
i did ask you a question .
answer me .
awoman .
awoman ...
what kind of a woman?
damn it , answer me .
i asked you a question .
i have to pry every word out of you .
completely naked .
peter !
aha , naked .
you see , dear .
they all talk about socialism and then they use our boy to deliver filth !
you should talk to them .
my god !
what's so horrible about seeing a naked woman?
after all , he is a big boy now , he can see things like that .
you should be ashamed .
and you too .
you're saying it was obscene .
actually she was a thousand times prettier than the one we have .
don't be impudent .
take a look .
just take a look .
look at her eyes .
that's what i call beauty !
you walk this way , she's following you .
walk that way , she's following you again .
what a beauty !
i'd like to see somebody paint like that these days !
it's all scribbling , now .
goodbye .
isn't pavla going out with mara?
she used to ...
hello .
hello .
so say something .
like what?
well , something .
nothing comes to mind right now ...
what were you looking at?
let me see .
it's just a poster .
let me see it .
it isn't a poster really .
what it was?
it's more like a painting .
so let me see it .
i can't .
just let me see .
i really can't .
where shall we go?
okay so keep it .
where shall we go?
nowhere .
so , here it is .
you've got it upside down .
where did you get it?
in our shop .
why is it so crumpled?
shame .
because i had it in my pocket .
how old do you think she is?
it's hard to say with women .
i mean with paintings .
she's definitely older than nine .
that's for sure .
it's nice .
shame it's crumpled .
i'd really love it if you could find time again tomorrow .
but when i get home now my mum will be angry of me being late , and i won't even be able to ask her .
i know just what you mean .
you can't imagine the hell i go through at home .
why?
well , just a hell .
my mum constantly wants me to tell her everything .
she even says i don't love her .
i do , but if i tell her that , she starts all over again .
and dad says i'll be the death of her ...
and she is so naive .
please , darling , don't drown there .
that's really horrible .
sonny , say hello to everybody !
it's like i don't know how to behave .
or she tells me i like other people more than her .
like who?
like my friend lada , for example .
i must leave , you can tell me some other time , okay?
then you'll come tomorrow .
i don't know yet .
i'll be there anyway , just in case .
bye now .
bye .
peter !
my mum wants to know if they have gherkins at your shop .
thanks .
see you !
what is it?
what are you doing?
you're just standing there and ...
it's embarrassing .
you're gaping like a dummy .
i'm just doing my job .
you call this working?
i've been watching you and it's not a pretty sight .
doing what?
well , i'm here watching .
that's not work !
just to stand and watch .
what are you watching?
the people , obviously .
obviously , but why?
so they don't steal something .
that's all right , then .
keep your eyes open .
sadly , there are still people with sticky fingers around here .
boss !
that's correct , really .
boss !
what is it , peter?
he's back , he's here again .
and who?
well , the one that i was chasing and he got away .
call me later , please .
a bit later , will you?
just wait a little .
wait .
has anything happened?
nothing .
some woman stole something .
what?
awoman?
what did she steal?
some sweets , or something .
nothing much .
worth about how much?
twelve crowns maybe .
it was not more .
did you go after her?
i did not .
so what did you do then?
nothing .
you didn't even follow her outside?
