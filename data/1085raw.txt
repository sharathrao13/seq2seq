read the charges .
dr. jumba jookiba
lead scientist of galaxy defense industries you stand before this council accused of illegal genetic experimentation .
how do you plead?
not guilty !
my experiments are only theoretical completely within legal boundaries .
we believe you actually created something .
created something? !
ha !
but that would be irresponsible and unethical .
i would never , ever ... ... make more than one .
what is that monstrosity?
monstrosity !
what you see before you is the first of a new species .
i call it experiment 6 2 6 .
he is bulletproof , fireproof and can think faster than supercomputer .
he can see in the dark and move objects 3, 000 times his size .
to destroy everything he touches !
so , it is a monster .
hey , just a little one .
it is an affront to nature .
it must be destroyed !
calm yourself , captain gantu .
perhaps it can be reasoned with .
experiment 6 2 6 give us some sign you understand any of this .
show us that there is something inside you that is good .
hmm?
meega , nala kweesta !
so naughty !
i didn't teach it that .
place that idiot scientist under arrest !
i prefer to be called " evil genius " !
and as for that abomination ... ... it is the flawed product of a deranged mind .
it has no place among us .
captain gantu , take him away .
with pleasure .
hmm .
uncomfortable?
oh ...
good !
the council has banished you to exile on a desert asteroid .
so , relax ... enjoy the trip and don't get any ideas .
these guns are locked onto your genetic signature .
they won't shoot anyone but you .
ow !
why , you ... !
may i remind the captain that he is on duty .
secure the cell !
aye , captain .
captain on deck .
all ahead full .
do ...
does this , uh , look infected to you?
oh !
quiet , you .
gunfire in the cell bay !
open a channel .
he's loose on deck c !
red alert .
seal off the deck !
security , converge on door seven !
deadly force authorized .
fire on sight !
there he is !
security to bridge .
it's in the ventilation system .
he's headed for the power ... ... grid .
what was that?
i don't think he's on the ship anymore .
confirmed .
he's taken a police cruiser .
yeah ... he took the red one .
yee haw !
hmm? !
that's it !
we got it .
we got it !
hyperdrive activated .
system charging .
he's engaged his h drive !
warning guidance is not functional .
pursuit commander that crazy trog is about to make a jump !
break formation !
get clear of that ship !
navigation failure .
do not engage hyper ...
get me galactic control .
where is he? !
he's still in hyperspace .
where will he exit?
calculating now quadrant 17 , section 0 0 5 , area 51 .
a planet called ...
ee arth .
i want an expert on this planet in here now !
what is that?
water .
most of the planet is covered in it .
he won't survive in water .
his molecular density is too great .
no ...
of course .
how much time do we have?
we have projected his landing at three hours , 42 minutes .
oh , we have to gas the planet .
hold it !
hold everything !
earth is a protected wildlife preserve .
yeah .
we've been using it to rebuild the mosquito population which , need i remind you , is an endangered species !
am i to assume you are the expert?
oh , i don't know about " expert .
agent pleakley at your service .
can we not simply destroy the island?
no !
crazyhead !
the mosquito's food of choice , primitive humanoid life forms have colonies all over that planet .
are they intelligent?
no , but they're very delicate .
in fact , every time an asteroid strikes their planet they have to begin life all over .
it's fascinating , isn't it?
with this , i've been able to study ...
what if our military forces just landed there?
well , that'd be a bad idea !
these are extremely simple creatures , miss .
landing there would create mass mayhem and planet wide panic !
a quiet capture would require an understanding of 6 2 6 that we do not possess !
who , then , mr. pleakley , would you send for his extraction?
does he have a brother?
close grandmother , perhaps?
friendly cousin?
neighbor with a beard?
he got away?
i'm sure this comes as no surprise to you .
i designed this creature for to be unstoppable .
which is precisely why you must now bring him back .
what?
me?
and to reward you we are willing to trade your freedom for his capture .
6 2 6 will not come easily .
maybe direct hit from plasma cannon might stun him long enough to ...
plasma cannon granted .
do we have a bargain , dr. jumba?
b b but it's a delicate planet !
who's going to control him?
you will .
very good , your highness .
i ...
i didn't quite ...
uh , you're notjoking !
so , tell me , my little one eyed one on what poor , pitiful , defenseless planet has my monstrosity been unleashed?

it's sandwich day .
every thursday , i take pudge the fish a peanut butter sandwich .
pudge is a fish?
and today we were out of peanut butter !
so i asked my sister what to give him and she said a tuna sandwich .
i can't give pudge tuna !
do you know what tuna is?
fish?
it's fish !
if i gave pudge tuna , i'd be an abomination !
i'm late because i had to go to the store and get peanut butter
'cause all we have is is stinkin 'tuna !
lilo , lilo , why is this so important?
pudge controls the weather .
you're crazy .
please !
please !
everybody calm down !
girls ...
shh .
lilo ...
i'm sorry !
i'm sorry !
i won't do it again !
maybe we should call your sister .

i'll be good !
i want to dance .
i practiced .
i just want to dance .
i practiced .
ooh , she bit me .
eww !
i called your sister .
she said to wait for her here on the porch .
we'll try again on sunday .
does this look infected to you?
yeah .
you better not have rabies .
if you have rabies the dogcatcher is going to have to cut ...
are you going to play dolls?
you don't have a doll .
this is scrump .
i made her , but her head is too big .
so i pretend a bug laid eggs in her ears , and she's upset because she only has a few more days to ...
lilo !
lilo?
lilo?
oh , no .
you better be home .
hey !
watch where you're going !
stupidhead !
# i found a new place to dwell ... #
oh , lilo !
lilo !
open the door , lilo !
go away . # ... you make me so lonely , baby ... #
lilo?
we don't have time for this . # ... i get so lonely ... #
leave me alone to die .
come on , lilo that social worker's going to be here any minute ! # ... you still can find ... #
# ... some room ... #
# for brokenhearted lovers to cry away their gloom #
# don't make me so lonely #
# i get so lonely i could die ... #
# the bellhop's tears keep flowin '... #
you are so finished when i get in there !
# well , they been so long on lonely street #
# they ain't ever gonna look back ... #
oh , i'm going to stuff you in the blender push " puree " , then bake you into a pie and feed it to the social worker !
and when he says , " mmm , this is great .
what's your secret?
i'm going to say ...
love ... and nurturing .
hi .
uh ...
you must be the , uh ...
the stupidhead .
oh !
oh ...
oh , you know , i'm really sorry about that and if i'd known who you were , of course i never would've ...
uh ...
i can pay for that .
it's a rental .
are you the guardian in question?
yes .
i'm nani .
nice to meet you , mister ...?
bubbles .
mr. bubbles .
that's a strange ...
yes , i know .
are you going to invite me in , nani?
uh ...
i thought we could sit out here and talk .
i don't think so .
right .
uh ...
# ... it's always crowded ... #
this way . # ... you still can find some room #
# for brokenhearted lovers to cry away their gloom #
# you make me so lonely , baby ... #
uh ... wait here .
hey !
so ...
lemonade?
do you often leave your sister home alone?
no .
never .
well , except forjust now .
uh , i had to run to the store to get some ...
oh !
you left the stove on while you were out?
low heat !
just a simmer .
mmm !
it's coming along great .
i found that this morning .
lilo !
there you are .
honeyface ... this is mr. bubbles .
nice to meet you .
your knuckles say " cobra " .
cobra bubbles .
you don't look like a social worker .
i'm a special classification .
did you ever kill anyone?
we're getting off the subject .
let's talk about you .
are you happy?
i'm adjusted .
i eat four food groups and look both ways before crossing the street and take long naps , and get disciplined .
disciplined?
yeah .
she disciplines me real good .
sometimes five times a day .
with bricks .
no ...
bricks?
uh huh , in a pillowcase .
okay !
that's enough sugar for you .
why don't you run along , you little cutie .
the other social workers just thought she was a scream .
thirsty?
let me illuminate to you the precarious situation in which you have found yourself .
i am the one they call when things go wrong and things have indeed gone wrong .
my friends need to be punished .
call me next time you're left here alone .
yep .
in case you're wondering , this did not go well .
you have three days to change my mind .
blah .
eww !
lilo !
why didn't you wait at the school?
you were supposed to wait there !
lilo !
do you not understand?
do you want to be taken away?
answer me !
no !
no , you don't understand?
no !
no , what?
no !
you're such a pain !
so why don't you sell me and buy a rabbit instead? !
at least a rabbit would behave better than you !
go ahead !
then you'll be happy because it'll be smarter than me , too !
and quieter !
you'll like it , 'cause it's stinky , like you !
go to your room !
i'm already in my room !
hey .
i brought you some pizza , in case you were hungry .
we're a broken family , aren't we?
no .
maybe , a little .
maybe a lot .
i shouldn't have yelled at you .
we're sisters .
it's our job .
yeah , well , from now on ...
i like you better as a sister than a mom .
yeah?
and you like me better as a sister than a rabbit , right?
oh ...
oh , oh , oh , oh .
yes .
yes , i do .
i hit mertle edmonds today .
you hit her?
before i bit her .
you bit her .
lilo , you shouldn't ...
people treat me different .
they just don't know what to say .
i'll tell you what .
if you promise not to fight anymore
i promise not to yell at you , except on special occasions .
tuesdays and bank holidays would be good .
yeah?
would that be good?
oh !
my camera's full again .
aren't they beautiful?
a falling star !
i call it !
get out !
get out !
i have to make a wish !
can't you go any faster?
oh , no !
gravity is increasing on me .
no , it's not !
it is , too , lilo .
the same thing happened yesterday .
you rotten sister !
your butt is crushing me !
why do you act so weird? !
it's me again .
i need someone to be my friend ... someone who won't run away .
maybe send me an angel ... the nicest angel you have .
what we when hit?
there it is .
it stay jammed under the fender .
we better call somebody .
we're looking for something that can defend itself ... something that won't die ... something sturdy , you know?
like a lobster .
lilo , you lolo .
do we have a lobster door?
no .
we have a dog door .
we are getting a dog .
so nice to see your pretty face again !
jumba?
we need your name and address at the bottom of the form ...
the kennel's back this way .
go .
pick someone out .
hello?
hello? !
are there any " aminals " in here?
hello !
hi .
hoh ... ha ...
hi ...
wow !
oh , yes .
mm hmm .
all of our dogs are adoptable .
except that one !
what is that thing? !
a dog , i think .
but it was dead this morning .
it was dead this morning? !
well , we thought it was dead .
it was hit by a truck .
i like him !
come here , boy .
oh !
aah !
wouldn't you like a different dog?
we have better dogs , dear .
not better than him .
he can talk !
say hello .
he ...
hel ...
dogs can't talk , dear .
he did .
does it have to be this dog?
yes , he's good .
i can tell .
you'll have to think of a name for him .
his name is ...
stitch .
now , that's not a real name ...
hmm .
uh uh , uh uh uh . ... in iceland ... but here , it's a good name .
stitch it is .
and there's a two dollar license fee .
i want to buy him !
can i borrow two dollars?
he's all yours .
you're all mine .
well , what's he doing?
shh !
keep quiet .
he's listening for us .
how good is his hearing?
i mean , can he ...
why don't you run?
coming !
i'm coming !
stop !
i have just determined this situation to be far too hazardous !
don't worry , i won't hit her .
no !
that girl is a part of the mosquito food chain .
here !
educate yourself .
using a little girl for a shield .
this is low , even for you !
whoo hoo !
bah !
tear him apart with all both my bare hands !
have you lost your mind? !
what is it , stitch?
we cannot be seen !
bad dog , barking at nothing !
you can't shoot , and you can't be seen .
look at you !
you look like a monster .
we have to blend in .
okay , i got to get to work .
stick around town and stay out of the roads , okay?
i'll meet you at 1 : 00 .
hmm?
oh !
ah !
okay , i guess we should be going .
what about stitch?
my friends !
what do you want?
i'm sorry i bit you and pulled your hair and punched you in the face .
apology not accepted .
now get out of my way before i run you over .
i got a new dog .
his name is stitch .
that is the ugliest thing i have ever saw .
yeah .
yeah .
eww !
get it away from me !
i'm gonna get a disease !
somebody do something !
oh , great !
he's loose .
his destructive programming is taking effect .
he will be irresistibly drawn to large cities where he will back up sewers reverse street signs and steal everyone's left shoe .
it's nice to live on an island with no large cities .
are you okay?

ay yi yi , lilo !
your dog cannot sit at the table .
stitch is troubled .
he needs desserts .
oh , you didn't even eat your sweet potato .
i thought you liked them .
desserts !

david , i told you , i can't .
i ...
i got a lot to deal with right now .
i know .
i just figured you might need some time ...
you smell like a lawn mower .

ugly look at me ...
uh , this is not working out .
uh , b but ...
mm mm .
yeah?
well , who wants to work at this stupid ... fakey luau anyway .
come on , lilo .
did you lose your job because of stitch and me?
nah .
the manager's a vampire and he wanted me to join his legion of the undead .
i knew it .
this is a great home .
you'll like it a lot .
see?
uh , lilo ...
comfy .
hey !
hey !
what is the matter with you?
be careful of the little angel !
it's not an angel , lilo .
i don't even think it's a dog .
we just have to take him back .
he's just cranky because it's his bedtime .
he's creepy , lilo .
i won't sleep while he's loose in the house .
you're loose in the house all the time and i sleep just fine !
hey , what are you doing?
stop that , stitch !
hey !
look at him , lilo .
he's obviously mutated from something else .
we have to take him back .
he was an orphan and we adopted him !
what about " o'hana "?
he hasn't been here that long .
neither have i.
dad said o'hana means family .
huh?
o'hana means family .
family means ... ... nobody gets left behind .
or ...?
or forgotten .
i know .
i know .
i hate it when you use o'hana against me .
mmm .
don't worry , you can sleep right next to me .
look how curious the puppy is .
this is my room , and this is your bed .
this is your dolly and bottle .
see?
doesn't spill .
i filled it with coffee .
good puppy .
now get into bed .
hey !
that's mine !
down !
mmm !
be careful of that !
you don't touch this !
don't ever touch it !
no !
don't pull on her head !
she's recovering from surgery .
no !
that's from my blue period .
mmm ...
there .
you know , you wreck everything you touch .
why not try and make something for a change?
ah !
wow .
san francisco .
save me !
eek !
no more caffeine for you .
this little girl is wasting her time .
6 2 6 cannot be taught to ignore its destructive programming .
ooh !
push that over .
what are you doing?
nothing !
uh , say , i want to try it on .
no !
share !
let me try it !
hey !
ow !
you're justjealous 'cause i'm pretty !
don't move .
a mosquito has chosen me as her perch .
she's so beautiful .
look , another one .
and another one !
why , it's a whole flock .
and they like me !
they're nuzzling my flesh with their noses .
now they're , um , they're ....
i think it might be a koala .
an evil koala .
i can't even pet it .
it keeps staring at me , like it's going to eat me .
hello?
nani?
hello?
are you there?
now , this is interesting .
what?
6 2 6 was designed to be a monster but now he has nothing to destroy .
you see , i never gave him a greater purpose .
what must it be like to have nothing . . . not even memories to visit in the middle of the night?
nah !
hmm .
hmm ...
that's the ugly duckling .
see?
he's sad because he's all alone and nobody wants him but on this page , his family hears him crying and they find him .
then the ugly duckling is happy because he knows where he belongs .
hmm ...
want to listen to the king?
you look like an elvis fan .
nani .
nani !
uh ... yeah?
look .

stitch dragged her down .
we lost stitch !
lilo?
lilo , look at me .
look at me , baby .
are you hurt?
no .
he's unconscious , but i think he's alive .
david , take lilo .
this isn't what it looks like .
we were ...
it it's just that ...
i know you're trying , nani but you need to think about what's best for lilo ... even if it removes you from the picture .
i'll be back tomorrow morning for lilo .
i'm sorry .
nani?
is there something i can do?
no , david .
uh , i need to take lilo home now .
we have a lot to talk about , lilo .

you know , i really believed they had a chance .
then you came along .
lilo , honey ... we have to , uh ...
don't worry .
you're nice , and someone will give you a job .
i would .
come here .
# aloha oe #
# aloha oe #
# e ke onaona noho i ka lipo #
# one fond embrace , a ho'i a'e au #
# until we meet again . #
that's us before ...
it was rainy , and they went for a drive .
what happened to yours?
i hear you cry at night .
do you dream about them?
i know that's why you wreck things and push me .
our family's little now and we don't have many toys but if you want , you could be part of it .
you could be our baby and we'd raise you to be good .
o'hana " means family .
family " means nobody gets left behind but if you want to leave , you can .
i'll remember you , though .
i remember everyone that leaves .
l ...

lost .
i'm lost .
help !
i don't like the ocean !
oh , look , a friendly little dolphin .
they helped sailors in the war ...
it's a shark !
it's a shark , and it ain't friendly !
it looks like a dolphin .
tricky fish !
tricky fish !
oh , octopus , come and help me?
an octo ... octopus is worse than a shark !
i hate this planet !
oh ...
little monster !
uh , agent pleakley here .
i have lost patience with you both .
have you captured 6 2 6 or not?
um ...
uh uh ...
consider yourselves fired and prisonbound .
your incompetence is nothing short of unspeakable !
but , uh ... mm ...
we're fired !
now we do it my way !
your way?
oh ... uh , wait !
it seems i have overestimated jumber and blinkley .
uh , jumba and pleakley .
whatever .
the mission is in jeopardy .
this could be your chance to redeem yourself , captain gantu .
how soon will you be prepared to leave?
immediately .
don't run .
don't make me shoot you .
you were expensive .
yes .
yes , that's it .
come quietly .
mm ... waiting .
for what?
family .
ah !
you don't have one .
i made you .
oh ... maybe i could ...
you're built to destroy .
you can never belong .
now come quietly and we will take you apart .
no , no , no , no , don't , don't run !
don't run !
lilo .
i didn't hear you get up .
baby , what's wrong?
stitch left .
really?
it's good he's gone .
he didn't want to be here , anyway .
we don't need him .
lilo ... sometimes you try your hardest but things don't work out the way you want them to .
sometimes things have to change and maybe sometimes they're for the better ... even if ...
nani !
david !
i think i found you a job .
you what? !
old man kukhkini's store , but we got to hurry .
oh , um , okay .
lilo?
baby , this is really important .
i need you to stay here for a few minutes .
i'm going to be right back .
lock the door and don't answer it for anyone , okay?
things are finally turning around .

that's okay .
you can just date me , and we'll call it even .

oh , lilo !
please don't do this .
you know i have no choice .
no !
you're not taking her !
i'm the only one who understands her !
you take that away , she won't stand a chance !
you're making this harder than it needs to be .
you don't know what you're doing !
she needs me !

it seems clear to me that you need her a lot more than she needs you .
lilo !
lilo !
lilo !
lilo !
lilo !
lilo !
lilo !

lilo !
she's a little girl this big !
she has black hair and brown eyes and she hangs around with that thing !
uh ...
we know her .

oh , we can't do that .
uh uh .
that would be a misuse of galactic resources .
see , problem is ... we're just here for him .
so she's gone?
look at the bright side .
you won't have to yell at anyone anymore .
come .
o'hana .
huh?

hold on .
grand councilwoman , let me explain .

if it wasn't for your experiment 6 2 6 none of this ...
stitch .

yes .
can stitch say good bye?
yes .
thank you .
who are you?
this is my family .
i found it all on my own .
it's little and broken ... but still good .
yeah .
still good .
does he really have to go?
you know as well as i that our laws are absolute .
i cannot change what the council has decided .
lilo , didn't you buy that thing at the shelter?
hey !
three days ago , i bought stitch at the shelter .
i paid two dollars for him .
see this stamp?
i own him .
if you take him , you're stealing .
aliens are all about rules .
you look familiar .
cla .
roswell .

take note of this .
this creature has been sentenced to life in exile a sentence that shall be henceforth served out here ... on earth ... and as caretaker of the alien life form , stitch this family is now under the official protection of the united galactic federation .
we'll be checking in now and then .
i was afraid you were going to say that .
this won't be easy to explain back at headquarters .
i know what you mean .
don't let those two get on my ship .
cla?
former .
saved the planet once .
convinced an alien race that mosquitoes were an endangered species .
