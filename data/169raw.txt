this is me , three hundred years ago .
my name was heishiro inukai .
it's a good name .
three centuries ago japan was ruled by the samurai .
the tokugawa shogunate had united the country , and it was a time of peace .
i was born the son of a samurai .
at age 21 , i met two " ronin " , or masterless samurai .
those encounters changed my life , and ensured that i remember them to this very day .
mr. kazamatsuri , i hope you realize the great honor .
this sword was given to our lord 80 years ago by tokugawa .
it is a clan treasure used in formal ceremonies .
guardian of the sword?
if only it were that simple .
just remember , it's very unusual for a newcomer such as you attain such an important post .
do not presume to impose on our lord's good graces .
to be frank , a newcomer should behave accordingly .
make sure you fulfill your duty .
heishiro , a man's mind should be composed at all times .
haste makes waste .
understand?
i arranged for you to work at the castle with me .
yet you start a fight with some no account samurai .
he switched sandals with me !
no excuse !
you've studied fencing , but you've yet to master the samurai spirit .
why not keep a bird?
it will help you to control your short temper .
birds belong in the wild .
you don't get it .
these birds are perfectly happy in cages .
aren't you , dear?
checkmate , father .
what?
councilor .
what is it?
a messenger to see you .
i'll be right there .
before you go up to the castle cut your hair .
look proper .
yes , father .
so , let's call it a draw .
what are you doing?
how unfair !
just like a child .
what is the problem?
my father was chief councilor to the nagashima clan , responsible for all clan affairs .
a problem had arisen .
a samurai , kazamatsuri , had killed an aide to our lord , and stolen the precious sword bestowed on us by the shogun .
we were granted the sword and the domain 80 years ago .
only we can tell the genuine one from a fake .
what are you suggesting?
send men after kazamatsuri .
in the meantime , have a duplicate made .
a fake?
why not just get the real sword back?
we must consider many things .
the young lord's attainment ceremony approaches .
without the sword , there will be hell to pay .
it could even lead to disbandment of the clan .
we must pretend that it was not stolen .
damn !
kazamatsuri came into our employ in a very dramatic fashion .
i seek vengeance for my son .
on guard !
what'll we do , boys?
good looking woman .
it'd be a waste to kill her .
kill the old man and then enjoy her !
you beasts !
prepare to die !
father !
hey you , i killed her husband , the old man's son .
you wanna protect these poor unfortunates?
what's so funny?
you're a dead man !
finish him off .
father ...
gladly , good sir !
no !
please don't !
begin .
our lord wanted to observe kazamatsuri's swordsmanship .
kazamatsuri !
the barbaric urge to watch gladiators battling has not changed since the roman era .
impressed , our lord hired kazamatsuri as a retainer .
i disagree with your methods , father .
i'll find him and kill him .
farewell .
stop !
i have already sent men after him .
you think he'll get away so you ordered up a fake .
not so loud .
i know i can do it .
while you were away in edo , he has improved greatly .
i have confidence in my swordsmanship .
i'm eager to match my sword against his .
heishiro !
idiot son .
kagemaru !
where are you this time?
you rang , sir .
enough of this dropping from the ceiling !
yes , sir , but old ninja habits are hard to break .
isn't there anyone else?
a bit younger , perhaps?
yes , i'm always training disciples for just such an occasion .
would you like to see them , sir?
yes , that boy may attempt something stupid .
i'd like to have all the angles covered .
heishiro !
wait .
don't try to stop me !
if you go alone , he'll kill you .
think about it , first .
i'm no coward like you !
come back !
i'll kill him .
no , i'll kill him .
i'll use my lance .
go back !
back home?
which way ... !
these two have been my best friends since childhood .
our clansmen dubbed us " the three stooges " .
well !
i'm nowhere near as stupid as they are .
stop following me !
this is tadasuke kurosawa .
how dare you run ahead of me !
this is shintaro suzuki .
you just watch me !
this way , sir .
any of them catch your eye?
there are so many ...
the sea goes on forever !
we often used to come here as boys .
i'm hungry .
me , too .
pick that up !
litterbug !
falcon !
red shadow !
you approve , sir?
i feel good .
listen .
did you know that ...
tadasuke is betrothed to mr. mukai's daughter .
is that true , tadasuke?
that's wonderful .
she's beautiful .
i heard you played around in edo .
how were the women?
don't be stupid .
i've no time for women .
you've never had a woman?
you're still a virgin?
damn !
don't get so upset !
i haven't , either .
me , neither .
but you soon will .
what the hell ... !
that's the clan treasure !
so what?
you finally showed your true colors .
i've had my suspicions about you .
you're planning to steal it !
i'm merely having a look .
a likely story !
you're a lying thief !
alright kazamatsuri , you asked for it !
how did it come to this?
stop splashing me .
that feels better .
thank you .
what do you know about kazamatsuri?
you never know what he's thinking .
they say he's unsociable and conceited .
as a newcomer he was treated distantly .
i saw him just once .
he's got this really scary face .
like this?
no , not even close .
that bad?
but why did he steal the sword?
see .
no one can figure him out .
i've got a wanted poster .
why didn't you say so earlier?
he's a mean one , alright .
he's 190cm tall .
he's gigantic !
he looks tough , too .
so what !
he's no match for me .
throw it .
that'll teach you !
look !
that's kazamatsuri !
really?
now we've got him !
tadasuke , you stay here .
why me?
you have a fiance to consider .
he's right .
don't you worry about me .
tadasuke , don't !
halt !
kazamatsuri !
on guard !
i am heishiro inukai of the nagashima clan .
i am tadasuke kurosawa .
shintaro suzuki !
he's so scared he's wetting himself !
don't underestimate us .
make your move !
scared , are you?
answer me !
fight !
that's a long leak !
on guard !
we can't wait !
a disgrace to the samurai .
shame on you !
the clan hired you and in return you stole .
shame on you !
are you listening?
shintaro !
be strong !
damn !
heishiro !
tadasuke !
enough !
sheathe your sword .
please , enough .
no more killing , i beg you .
i must insist .
i beg you , sir !
i had no choice .
yes , i know .
but no more .
i'm sorry .
it bet it hurt .
i'm really sorry .
you in the shadows , come forth .
i'm going to need some help here .
honorable heishiro !
i understand your problem but this is going too far .
killing solves nothing .
please nurse him well .
i'll go back to the domain and make a report .
farewell .
and don't come back !
but ...
next time he'll kill you for sure .
and your friend here , too .
swear that you'll never come back .
brooms !
basketware !
hello , nao .
got time for a cup of tea?
sir , how would you like to have some fun?
first , a spot of gambling to win some money , then a whorehouse for some real fun .
what do you say?
good idea , sir?
mr. samurai !
fools !
what the hell are you doing?
the game's starting !
boss , stop writhing , you're making me miss the spot .
please stay still .
sakichi , ma'am !
enter .
another samurai has joined magobei .
is that so?
i reckon he's preparing an army to attack us .
magobei doesn't have the balls to come at us alone .
only an idiot would recruit that band of incompetents .
but ma'am , we need more men .
don't be hasty and end up with dregs .
leave everything to me .
a superb body .
what !?
turn on your side , please ma'am .
put some power into it !
yes , power , certainly ...
good .
yes , that's the spot .
here?
not there , you pervert !
but it's such a lovely body .
ma'am , we've got some ronin out of control .
how interesting .
i'll go take a look .
he'll lose these cheating hands !
what !
let's see you try !
you just watch it !
gentlemen , i think that's quite enough .
don't tell me a woman runs this show !
that's all very interesting , but you run a crooked house , lady .
any trouble here and we feed you to the crows .
any man .
be he samurai or lord !
well , well !
in here , mr. samurai .
we'll leave it at this for today .
please .
be seated .
let's begin .
i'll take over here .
we're honored , ma'am .
yes , why not .
wonderful !
then place your bets .
into play !
place your bets .
odds or evens .
the betting is closed .
in play !
luck wasn't with you today , was it?
please come again .
sir , you're welcome to stay as long as you like .
he's awake .
how do you feel?
i'm hanbei mizoguchi .
we met on the road .
what about my two friends?
the one called suzuki is fine .
we had no room .
another family took him in .
his injuries were slight and he's gone home .
good .
shintaro was saved .
don't .
your wound will open again .
are you hungry?
no appetite means you must stay in bed .
you're not ready to get up .
my daughter , koharu .
you've been unconscious for two days .
you were in great pain that first night .
we were worried .
i'm in your debt .
are you sure you won't eat something?
i'll make some gruel .
those were the hardest days of that life .
i was so ashamed , i just wanted to curl up and die .
open your mouth , please .
that's good .
father , your tea is getting cold .
delicious !
delicious .
ready , fight !
give him hell !
well done !
super !
what a woman !
here you are , sir .
let me refill your cup .
all the samurai i've known were totally useless .
i've never met a swordsman of your caliber .
you're ever so strong , sir .
let's take a bath .
sir , you really shouldn't joke so .
i was asking him .
heishiro , don't go .
i'll go kill him !
no , you mustn't .
see !
you must get well first .
don't stop me .
i must avenge tadasuke's death .
please don't .
damn it .
you can't do anything until you're well .
if you fight him now , he'll only beat you again .
enough koharu !
i'm sorry .
but you agree with me , don't you father?
regardless , stay in bed for now .
perhaps i can be of some assistance .
i appreciate it .
but you must not kill kazamatsuri .
there must be no more killing .
there are other means to recover the sword .
no !
he dies !
stubborn !!
look at that !
it's so huge !
sir .
do you like the sea?
yes , i do .
good .
me , i love the sea .
can i ask you something?
what?
how many men have you killed?
please tell me , sir .
gosuke , how many women have you slept with?
how many?
i've lost count .
me , too .
cool !
cool !
cool !
gosuke .
take it off .
we'd better get going .
but sir !
wait for me .
don't touch that !
you'll break out in a rash .
from just brushing against it?
that stinks !
it's an herb .
it makes an excellent medicine .
is that so?
you're so knowledgeable .
i shouldn't be wasting time like this .
all this talk of killing and revenge is not helping you to recover .
look at the beautiful clouds .
be careful .
it's slippery .
i slipped first .
but it was fun .
was it?
this is a lovely place .
in autumn we get wild grapes .
are you alright?
yes .
i wonder what caused that?
but it really is delicious .
we had so much fun up on the mountain today .
we rolled around together , like this .
please let me explain .
we went there to pick herbs together .
koharu slipped first .
i , worried she may get hurt , extended my hand .
as a result we both fell .
if i got hurt out there it wouldn't really matter .
but if koharu did , you'd think ill of me .
why are you both looking at me like that?
we escaped with just a mud bath , that's all .
so that's all it was?
we got totally covered in mud .
i'm relieved no one was hurt .
would you care for a drink?
no , thank you .
i don't drink .
even a whiff of it floors me for days .
if you say so ...
please do .
did i tell you about his nosebleed?
excuse me .
kagemaru !
you rang , sir?
how is my son?
according to the report , he's sufficiently recovered to gather herbs with a maiden .
a young girl?
silly boy !
whatever is he thinking?
enough about him .
where is the sword?
still with kazamatsuri .
look .
that was wonderful music .
thank you .
tell us all the latest news from town .
the takatsume gang in town ...
some wild ronin called kazamatsuri joined them .
kazamatsuri , you say?
you must have heard .
he chopped up those gamblers .
heishiro , you mustn't !
please don't .
it's not wise .
try another way .
ask him to give it back .
ridiculous .
talk to the man .
he'll understand .
he's no man !
i'll kill him .
yes !
but get him when he's drunk .
persuade him to turn over a new leaf .
totally unbelievable .
you mustn't !
he'll kill you first !
what? !
i'll go talk to him .
you wait here .
never !
some hot sake , please .
that's hot !
good .
excuse me .
what?
is mr. kazamatsuri here?
kazamatsuri?
you're a friend?
i wouldn't say friend , but ...
my name is hanbei mizoguchi .
i'm the petty samurai he attacked out on the road .
he'll remember me .
attacked by kazamatsuri , you say?
then he's after revenge , idiot !
get out !
i'm sorry for any imposition .
persistent little bugger !
out you go !
mr. kazamatsuri !
are you there?
out with you !
arm yourselves !
the swords !
i didn't mean to ...
i merely wish to see mr. kazamatsuri .
so sorry .
let me pull it out .
terribly sorry .
are you alright?
you scoundrel !
be careful .
you'll hurt yourself .
that's quite enough .
get him !
swords can be very dangerous .
be careful .
i'll come back when mr. kazamatsuri's not indisposed .
who on earth was that?
begging your pardon .
we have a favor to ask .
you two again?
we are to escort heishiro back to the domain .
in that case , i'm happy to help .
but on one condition .
you carry him .
he stinks .
how could you? !
he's suffering so !
i had no choice .
i made him throw up , so he just needs sleep .
by the way ...
i've been thinking of enlarging my business for a while now .
you could be a great help .
and i'd be much happier with a larger territory .
don't you agree?
so skillful , but hidden away in the boondocks .
why?
because i'm a member of the underworld .
totally different from those solid citizens .
hanbei mizoguchi , a master swordsman , indeed .
why do you hide yourself away?
an era of peace?
damned shogunate !
how do you feel now?
i thought i'd die .
you poor thing .
i went to see kazamatsuri .
what !?
why didn't you tell me earlier?
so many ruffians there , i never even got to talk .
but i did meet a good ally .
falcon !
why are you here?
i swapped a fake for this , the real sword .
your father has suffered a heart attack .
what?
father is ill?
you must return immediately .
first i must kill kazamatsuri .
so you say , but it was you who almost died .
i won't fail again !
you will !
what?
no time to argue , sir .
we'll watch kazamatsuri while you're away .
i can't go back empty handed .
nothing will be gained if you lose your life .
your friend will have died in vain .
your duty is to take the sword back .
you don't understand !
you can kill him any time .
no , killing is ...
father , shut up .
you're complicating matters .
excuse us .
falcon !
on horseback you could be home in three days .
i'll get a horse in town .
mr. mizoguchi !
get ready to travel .
you have but one father .
forgive me .
we really have no choice .
sorry you must spend your savings on me .
we weren't talking about money .
good luck .
i'll find you a good horse .
you should be getting ready .
i'll make lunch in a little while .
how long have you lived like this?
since i was this big .
doesn't your father wish to work as an official?
he's not the kind of man to push himself forward .
indeed .
various lords have tried to recruit him .
actually , he was once hired as a martial arts instructor .
but being too modest can sometimes be offensive .
yes , i quite agree .
he hasn't elaborated , but he's always felt awkward with others .
i really don't want him to be employed by some lord .
but if he receives a stipend from a lord and master , he must draw his sword for the lord's sake .
i don't want him to fight .
i think he feels the same .
you don't resemble each other , but you both have gentle hearts .
actually i'm not his real daughter , you know .
i was an orphan .
he adopted me and raised me here .
i see .
blood relationships are of no importance to me .
i regard him as my real father .
help me peel these .
pull this bit off , like this .
that's it .
shinkage fencing school grand hall
shinkage fencing school grand hall
excuse me .
may i help you?
i have heard of master kajii's reputation .
i'd appreciate a match with him .
it is customary to have a match with a disciple first .
yes , i know .
sorry about this , koharu .
begin !
ready?
yes .
i yield .
next !
i yield .
next !
since your master appears to be indisposed ,
i'll accept a small sum instead .
it may seem rude to ask ... ... but why did he adopt you in the first place?
well ... you see ...
he's back !
take good care .
i'll be back soon .
god speed .
father !
good weather , isn't it?
i was relieved to hear you're going to the whorehouse .
we were worried that you might be one of them .
i don't want a woman .
you two go and have some fun .
really truly?
thank you so much .
i'll just watch .
watch?
sir !
right .
a touch more .
just a touch , i said !
look , the pony express .
so fast ... ... in the saddle .
he's coming back .
it's councilor inukai's lad .
how is my father?
something wrong with him?
i heard he had a heart attack .
no way !
he's full of beans .
only yesterday he cussed me out something fierce .
what? !
they tricked me !
take this to him !
the ancestral sword !
but sir ...
speedy !
they tricked me !
let us begin !
come on , everyone .
alright then , lads .
who'll be first?
you?
good .
ready?
you win .
here you go .
who's next?
you want to try?
c'mon , let's go .
hanbei mizoguchi?
let's have a duel .
it's a penny a try .
i meant a real match .
why so eager to cross swords with me?
it's perfectly natural for a master swordsman to fight .
i admit you're better .
isn't that enough?
will you return the sword to that young noble?
you mean inukai?
he's the stupid son of an hereditary councilor .
such an idiot can succeed to important positions .
that's the way of the world .
if he raises a hand to me again ,
i'll chop the damn thing off .
if you agree to a match with me , i'll return the sword .
father .
let's make some plum brandy and sell it .
so many plums this year .
he's back .
falcon deceived me .
the rat !
he must have had good reason to .
kazamatsuri had reason to take the sword , too .
ridiculous !
he killed father's attendant and stole it .
plus he killed tadasuke .
if you try to stop me , i'll never forgive you .
how about another helping?
mr. inukai .
i think i know how to beat kazamatsuri .
don't get too close .
throw stones .
ridiculous .
with swords , you've no chance against him .
a surprise attack would never work .
i threw stones at him and saved your life .
y ... yes , but ...
you remember , don't you?
don't denigrate stones !
i won't .
throw them at him like rain .
then hit him with a big stick .
that's it .
no need to kill him .
i understand !
thank you .
good !
all set .
watch me .
i get it .
close .
lower !
what are you doing?
off your knees !
stretch that arm .
tuck in your chin .
aim higher .
father .
he's hopeless .
that you , okatsu?
how did you know?
the wind brought your scent to me .
i'm pleased that you recognize my smell .
this sword must be very dear to you .
it's nothing but an ornament .
take it if you want .
i don't want a sword .
master .
you deserve more than a mere samurai's life .
why not quit your rank ... and help me to take over this area?
you'll wear fine clothes .
as many women as you like .
a life of luxury awaits you .
don't make a sound .
kazamatsuri is too much for you to handle .
he's a criminal who spits on the shogunate .
what did he do?
in that brocade sheath is a treasured gift from the shogun .
if you do as i say , you will live .
the reward is 1, 000 in gold .
is this a trick?
mix this into his drink .
good shot !
you're doing very well .
no , i need more practice .
let me help you .
no need to .
i can do it myself ...
but i want to help you .
let me take this .
it's too heavy for you .
are you alright?
another nosebleed .
practicing too hard , perhaps?
too much can hurt you .
aren't you respectful today?
how unusual .
what are you making?
pepper balls .
pepper balls?
to fling into his eyes .
ninja weapons .
that's brilliant !
good with rice balls , too .
aren't you the early bird?
how about a wake up dram?
okatsu .
will you marry me?
i'm very flattered .
i was serious .
that's not very nice .
but really ...
it's all so sudden .
a woman needs time to think things over .
i'm a woman who's killed all manner of men .
even trumped up little samurai like you !
no stray dog is going to give me any cheek .
how did it come to this?
what was that?
madam !
what happened?
oh no ...
stones , stones .
a sword is no way to win .
i graduated from a fencing school .
how proud you must be .
i've heard you once taught at a fencing school .
for all outward appearances .
too much modesty brings others 'hatred .
you're a skilled swordsman .
yet you stop me from killing kazamatsuri .
killing is wrong .
that's what swords are for .
don't you wear yours when you go to town?
for what other possible reason?
i'm ashamed to say ...
i still cling to the hope of being employed as an official .
but let me make one thing clear !
martial arts are not about killing !
i don't understand .
why do you stop me from killing a wicked man like him?
i killed a man once .
he was koharu's father .
koharu's real father was named ryunosuke kuzumi .
fifteen years ago the fief i belonged to had a border dispute with a neighboring clan .
i was a guard there , under orders to kill anyone crossing the border .
kuzumi had a similar duty for his clan .
in the river , which was claimed by both clans ,
i met kuzumi and we crossed swords .
the first time i killed a man .
i was overwhelmed by guilt .
one thing ...
what?
grant me a favor .
kuzumi had a young daughter .
a widower , his last words were of regret for his daughter .
i , a single man at the time , left the fief and adopted her .
but not from sympathy or guilt .
i decided to rectify the sin i had committed , by raising the child of the man i had killed .
as she grew up , i realized a truth ...
one must cherish life and live it to its end .
that is a man's duty .
as a young man i was very conceited .
proud of my fencing skills and afraid of nothing .
i would have likely ended up like kazamatsuri .
the human spirit contains both good and evil .
even those who seem evil have some good in them .
even kazamatsuri may change .
only the gods should take a person's life .
i've said too much .
does koharu know that you killed her father?
yes , i told her .
tell mizoguchi to fight me if he wants to get koharu back .
falcon !
kazamatsuri has got koharu !
what !
prepare to die kazamatsuri !
you take care of koharu .
yes !
no !
don't get too close .
hanbei mizoguchi ,
i see though your mask hiding anger and thirst for revenge .
it is as plain as day to me .
you'll wear that mask till your dying day .
but you will cross swords with me this day !
i accept the challenge .
draw your blade !
your father will surely win .
you will be my wife .
mizoguchi will be my father .
it's all decided !
sir !
falcon , protect her .
don't die !
i'll never forgive you .
mr. mizoguchi .
stay back .
don't get too close !
hanbei mizoguchi ...
it was an honor to have fought you .
and that was how kazamatsuri went out of my life .
no trace of anger , no resentment , did he let show on his face .
as i prayed for him , i felt something greater ... ... watching over me from above .
when a man abandons ego and obstinacy , he can accept the gods and learn how to truly love .
it took me a long time to realize that essential truth .
the most important thing is to give your all until the very last .
kagemaru !
you rang , sir .
falcon !
you rang , sir .
we just felt like calling you .
i shaved my pate and became an official .
i married koharu , who softened both father's temper and mine .
how does that feel?
terrible .
right , my pretty?
red shadow quit the ninja and became a maid to koharu .
mizoguchi became clan secretary and sheathed his sword forever .
hard at it , eh?
oh yes , about the sword ...
there's no sign of his body .
probably swept down river .
he couldn't have survived .
what shall we do?
what?
the sword in the river is the real one .
what !
the sheath was over there .
then the sword must be directly below !
here it is !
here?
yes , here .
can you swim?
we'll soon find out .
go !
