if a friend gets involved in a relationship , it affects your friendship .
because you're like a comedy team , and now there's this third person .
who's on first?
i don't know .
dear , who do you think is on first?
i look like the person you used to know ... ... but i've been modified to survive in this relationship .
in other words , if we're having an argument and she's there ... ... i may say , 'i totally disagree with you . '
'i'd like to help you out , but i'd rather continue to see her naked . " '
okay , cowboys , what will you have?
i'll have the turkey club without the bacon .
and i'll have the bacon club without the turkey .
george , don't make me get tough with you .
why?
you think you can beat me up?
you wouldn't want me to mess up that beautiful face of yours .
stop it .
stop it .
you don't want bacon .
i'll surprise you .
is she not terrific?
she does have a way .
you think she thinks i have a beautiful face?
well , they do work on tips .
george , don't make me get tough with you .
who says that?
she is really cool .
what do you think?
you think she likes me?
i should've got the egg white omelet .
why should she like me?
who am i?
there's a million people to like .
the omelet .
damn .
maybe she could like me .
is it that far fetched?
maybe she sees something .
is it possible?
no .
not possible .
no .
not possible .
hey .
hey , laney .
how was the trip?
what trip?
you were gone?
i went to england .
with mr. pitt , for five days?
how was it?
actually , it was great .
i met an englishman , and we really hit it off .
well , that relationship has obviously got a lot of potential .
yeah , well , jerome ... ... i happen to be flying him in on my frequent flier miles .
flying him in?
how long is he staying for?
it's an open ended ticket .
he can return anytime he wants .
all this in five days .
oh , no .
it's kenny bania .
who's he?
he's this awful comedian .
hey , jerry .
hey , kenny .
elaine , george .
hi .
how's it going?
great .
i've been working out .
went from a size 40 to a 42 .
no kidding?
yeah .
i'm huge .
well , i'll leave you guys alone .
okay , thanks .
oh , jerry , you know what just hit me?
i was thinking ...
what size suit are you?
i'm a 40 .
why?
i just got a brand new armani suit , doesn't fit me anymore .
you want it?
well , i don't know if ...
oh , come on .
why should it sit in a closet?
an armani suit?
take the suit .
well , okay , i guess .
you gonna be home later?
yeah .
i'll drop it off .
hey , new suit !
yeah , yeah .
lucky me .
here , i personally made you a cold chicken sandwich .
it's not even on the menu .
oh , this is fabulous .
boy , she is nice .
i like her .
i like her , jerry .
she's got substance .
she oozes substance .
well , go in there and talk to her .
she's not gonna put them on the glass .
you mean the walk back in?
that's the toughest move in the business .
you're sending me into no mars land ... ... and if i get shot down , i have to crawl back .
well , i can't do it , i tell you !
pull yourself together .
you're going in there , soldier .
that's an order !
get in there .
hey .
hey .
listen , i need you to do me a favor .
what?
help me move my refrigerator .
why?
because i'm getting rid of it .
yeah?
it's k. b. i have the suit .
all right , come on up .
so ...
why get rid of your refrigerator?
after that kidney stone , i only want fresh food .
it's gotta be fresh .
i'm not eating any more stored food .
plus , you know , i want the space .
what for?
well , i could put a dresser in there .
i could get dressed while i'm making breakfast .
hey !
here you go .
yeah .
didrt think i was really gonna give you a suit , did you?
you're giving him this suit?
that's right .
and it's armani .
armani?
hey , armani , jerry .
yes , yes , i heard .
come on , try it on .
no , it's okay .
come on .
i want to see how it fits .
all right .
there you go .
there , okay?
oh , boy .
look at that .
that looks great .
i can't believe you're giving him this .
and i don't even want anything for it .
he's very generous , isn't he?
yes .
yes , he is .
i'll tell you what , you can take me out to dinner sometime .
dinner?
yeah , you buy me a meal .
can't get a better deal than that .
you'll never get a better deal .
all right , i'll leave you alone .
yeah , yeah .
look at that .
armani .
yeah .
yeah , that's a deal .
that's a terrible deal .
i don't want to go out to dinner with him .
i'd rather make my own suit .
i did it .
it's all done .
hey .
i did it .
we're going out as soon as she gets off work .
and it'll still be daytime .
i'm better in the daytime than at night .
it's less pressure .
i love the day date .
no wine , no shower .
there you go .
so the trip was good?
yes .
apart from that dreadful airline food .
wreaked absolute havoc with my stomach .
you know , i have to say , i've never admitted this to anyone ... ... but i kind of like airline food .
that's probably because of ...
what?
what?
yeah , what?
what?
where i come from , we don't say " what .
it's proper to say " pardon .
oh , this should be interesting .
pardon?
nothing .
so then , about a year ago , i started selling these funky little hair clips .
it's going pretty good .
i make them in my apartment .
i'm just waitressing because i wanted to go to europe this summer ... ... and i could use a few extra ...
careful .
oh , it's just horse manure .
horse manure's not that bad .
i don't even mind the word " manure .
you know , it's " nure , " which is good ... ... and a " ma " in front of it .
manure .
when you consider the other choices , " manure " is actually pretty refreshing .
that's a nice watch , george .
yeah .
you know , my boyfriend has the same one .
really?
yeah , he loves watches .
he's a real watch freak .
well , how about that?
oh , look out .
you stepped right in it .
yes .
i sure did .
so you just pretended it didn't bother you?
what is that?
boyfriend?
i don't understand that .
what does she think i asked her out for?
it's the way they just slip it in there too .
yeah , like it's all just part of the conversation .
my boyfriend really likes watches .
he's a real watch freak .
well , that's fabulous .
well , let me ask you this .
what exactly did you say when you asked her out?
i said , " would you like to go for a walk or something?
oh , a walk?
well ...
or something .
i said " or something .
or something?
yeah , that's a date .
there you go .
of course , there is always the possibility that she called an audible .
what do you mean?
she got to the line of scrimmage ... ... didn't like the looks of the defense and changed the play .
i think things were going okay .
we were having a nice conversation .
i mentioned how i liked horse manure .
you did?
yeah .
you said you liked horse manure?
yeah .
you know , about how , when you break it down , it's really a very positive thing .
you know , you have a " nure " with a " ma " in front of it .
manure .
it's not bad .
and it was around this point she mentioned the boyfriend?
yeah .
oh , you think because of what i said about the manure?
i was just saying how it takes a negative thing ... ... and puts a positive spin on it .
i'm just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored ... ... with your thoughts and feelings on manure .
so you don't think she really has a boyfriend .
my honest opinion?
i think she made it up .
well , then she's just a liar , isn't she?
hey .
you want something to eat , don't you?
oh , no , no , no .
you got me all wrong , buddy .
i am loving this no refrigerator .
you know what i discovered?
i really like depriving myself of things .
it's fun .
very monastic .
well , what do you eat?
it's all fresh .
fresh fish , fresh fowl , fresh fruit .
i buy it .
i eat it .
well , i'm glad it's working out .
oh , yeah .
it's working out .
and i got a date with that waitress who works at reggie's .
boy , if i could meet a hostess , we could open up our own place .
yeah .
well , i'll tell you , she's a full figured gal .
is she?
oh , you better believe it , buddy .
george , we could double sometime .
yeah , yeah , we could .
you know , kramer , the next time you talk to her ... ... find out if she knows kelly from monk's .
i want to know if she really has a boyfriend .
all right , let's get over here .
hello .
hi , jerry .
it's kenny .
oh , hi .
i was thinking , if you're not busy ... ... maybe i can get my meal today?
yeah , you want to get that meal , don't you?
how about mendy's .
ever been there?
no , i haven't .
you're gonna love it .
i'll meet you there around 7 .
all right .
yeah , i really needed that suit .
i start off with curls .
that's good for the bicep .
i do 10 reps , two sets .
that's fantastic .
you work out with weights?
i don't .
you should .
why?
you worn the suit yet?
no , not yet .
have you decided?
oh , get the swordfish .
best swordfish in the city .
the best , jerry .
i'll have the salmon .
and you?
you know what i think?
i'm just gonna have soup .
yeah , i'll save the meal for another time .
another time?
what other time?
i had a hot dog earlier .
i'm not that hungry .
no , no , bania , no .
this is the dinner .
the soup counts .
soup's not a meal .
you're supposed to buy me a meal .
i'm not stopping you from eating .
go ahead .
get anything you want .
but i don't want anything but soup .
then that's the meal .
but i had the hot dog .
who told you to have a hot dog?
hey , i give you a brand new armani suit ... ... and you won't even buy me a meal .
all right , fine .
get the soup .
so he just gets soup .
he wants to save the meal .
so now i got to do it all over again .
what kind of soup did he get?
i don't know .
consomme or something .
consomme .
what?
well , that's really not a meal , jerry .
i mean , if he had gotten chicken gumbo or matzo ball ... ... even mushroom barley , then i would agree with you .
those are very hearty soups .
you're missing the whole point .
what?
the meal is the act of sitting down with him .
it doesn't matter what you get .
as long as he's sitting in that restaurant , it's a meal .
was it a cup or a bowl?
you see?
again .
i'm just curious .
a bowl , okay?
did he crumble any crackers in it?
did he crumble any crackers in it?
as a matter of fact , he did .
oh , well , crackers in a bowl .
that could be a meal .
it's like i'm talking to my aunt sylvia here .
hi , simon .
this is jerry .
hello .
elaine , do you have cash on you?
yeah , in my purse .
no , there was only $6 .
well , i have some money .
what do you need?
twenty should cover me .
thanks , mate .
where are you going?
just visiting .
okay .
see you later .
i won't be back for dinner .
pardon?
so is she working?
is she here?
yeah , yeah , she's here .
have you said anything?
no .
i'm very uncomfortable .
are you gonna say anything?
i don't know .
i don't know .
hello .
hello .
well , what's it going to be?
" what's it gonna be?
yes .
what will you have?
are you eating?
it's in that vein .
i'll just have a bowl of chili .
i'll have an egg white omelet .
" what's it gonna be? " hear that?
yeah , that was bad .
did you feel that tension?
we used to have banter .
there's no more banter .
oh , no .
it's kenny .
slide out so he can't sit here .
hey .
hey .
you worn the suit yet?
actually i did .
i put it on last night and slept in it .
you did?
no , i'm joking .
can i squeeze in?
sure you can .
thanks .
can i take your order?
what kind of soup do you have?
why don't you get a sandwich .
okay .
i'll have tomato soup and tuna on toast .
okay .
this is it , you know .
this is the meal .
so stock up , buddy boy .
what are you talking about?
this isn't a meal .
yes , it is .
soup and sandwich .
that is a meal .
you're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant like mendy's .
i tried to do that .
this is lunch in a coffee shop .
it doesn't matter .
this is it .
this completes the transaction .
oh , soup and a sandwich for a brand new armani suit .
is that any kind of a gesture?
i'm really not comfortable ...
hey , i just spoke to hildy about your friend .
yeah?
she doesn't have a boyfriend .
she made it up .
hi .
hi .
where's simon?
oh , he'll be right up .
he's just getting some beer .
and i'm not expecting any change .
whers he leaving?
about two days .
although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay .
fortunately , he has no money and no prospects .
hey , mate .
fancy a beer?
no , thanks .
hello?
no , i'm sorry , bania .
i'm not going over this again .
well , who told you to order soup?
no , there's no dinner .
there's not going to be any dinner .
you've had a sandwich and two bowls of soup , and that's it .
goodbye .
hey , what size suit are you?
forty .
forty .
perfect .
brand new armani suit , you want it?
absolutely .
great .
it's yours .
i can't stand the sight of it .
elaine , here's the car keys .
thanks .
yep .
listen , jerry .
i been doing some thinking .
i want my suit back .
i don't have your suit .
i gave it away .
well , it's my suit .
well , it's gone .
i'm sorry .
goodbye , bania .
hey .
hey .
yeah .
well , how's everything?
okay .
good .
what's going on?
nothing .
really?
you want food , don't you?
it's not for me , it's for hildy , the waitress i was telling you about .
she's hungry .
she wants food .
if i go back in there without any food , there's gonna be trouble .
all right , go ahead .
did you find anything?
yeah .
there's a few things in here .
peanut butter , cheese .
yeah .
cheese is good .
what kind?
swiss .
all right , it'll have to do .
come on .
what are you doing out here?
i can't go in there .
i'm too uncomfortable .
so we're not gonna go in there anymore?
hey , what are you doing out here?
we can't eat here anymore , because he took a waitress for a walk .
what's the difference?
let's go to reggie's .
reggie's?
i can't eat anything there .
it's the same menu .
there's no big salad .
they'll make you a big salad .
what do you think , they're the only ones that make a big salad?
all right , let's go to reggie's .
so , what's going on with simon?
did he leave?
wait till you hear this .
so simon picks this woman up right in front of me .
look at this .
no egg white omelets .
look at that .
so what?
have a yolk .
it won't kill you .
hello .
oh , hi , hildy .
could i get an egg white omelet?
did you read the menu?
all right .
just give me a western .
how about a big salad?
a big salad?
you see?
just tell her what you want .
they'll make it for you .
it's a salad , only bigger , with lots of stuff in it .
i can bring you two small salads .
could you put it in a big bowl?
we don't have big bowls .
all right , just give me a cup of decaf .
we have sanka .
i mean , it's not fair .
i've been going there for seven years .
she's been there three weeks .
not fair .
if anyone should be forced to leave , it should be her .
she's on your turf .
if only she could get fired .
is there any way that could happen?
i mean , i know how to get myself fired .
you're the best .
well ...
how do i get someone else fired?
well , as i see it ... ... you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired ... ... but redirected outwardly .
hey .
hey .
she's hungry , jerry .
well , there's nothing left .
there's no food .
no food?
well , you gotta have something .
i can't go back in there with no food .
she expecting something , jerry .
you don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops .
there , you see , she's already in a bad mood .
she just got fired .
why did she get fired?
because i called over there a couple of times ... ... and the manager didn't like it .
simon is definitely going back now .
he's meeting me here to return my keys .
boy , he's a real bounder , isn't he?
yes , he's one of those bounders .
egg white omelet , big salad .
thank you .
i wanted you guys to know that friday is my last day .
bloomingdale's ordered a bunch of my clips .
thank god .
i don't have to do this anymore .
hey , jerry .
where's my suit?
i don't have it .
you want half my omelet?
i told you , she's busy .
she can't come to the phone now .
tell your boyfriend to stop calling here .
he's not my boyfriend .
it's that bald guy with the glasses who's always here with them .
he's trying to get me in trouble .
hey !
yeah .
i got a message for you .
you tell your friend george ... ... that the next time i see him around here ... ... i'm gonna turn him into my own personal hand puppet .
well , hello .
here you are , as promised .
you see , i'm a man of my word .
when are you leaving?
are you trying to get rid of me?
i was supposed to leave tomorrow , but i've been set up with a job interview ... ... that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely .
and it is all due to this suit .
how do i look?
i'm a shoo in , aren't i?
thanks again , hon .
hey , kenny .

yeah .
there it goes .
