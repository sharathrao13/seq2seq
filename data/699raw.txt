and , he see's this light ahead of him .
around 500 metres .
and , first he thinks it's a truck or a semi trailer or something coz the light's really bright , like glowing orange and shit .
yeah .
but as he gets closer he realizes the lights about 10 metres off the ground , it's hanging in mid air .
so he's scared .
he's freaking out .
and then he hears this crack .
like an explosion .
that was supposed to scare us .
i know , it's not scary .
alright , but he did .
he heard this crack .
like an explosion , of a jet .
and it just took off into the sky .
straight up like a rocket .
and then as soon as it was gone , his car just stopped in the middle of the road .
and it was totally silent , and he was just sitting there .
staring up at the stars .
in the middle of nowhere .
hey !
for no reason , just stopped .
is that a true story?
absolutely !
he's got something ..
you've got something dripping off the side of your lip there .
oh , it's all right .
it was just bullshit .
nah bullshit you mate !
what's all this shit?
oh it's the tent .

here we go .
wolf creek crater !
the crater , we're here !
walking trail !
walking trail !
allow three hours .
three hours?

no camping , hiking is allowed .
put your rubbish in a bin .
no fires .
ok .

yep .
look how good it looks .
cooooeee !
come on !
you alright?
wow .
that's impressive .
yeah you're looking at one of the biggest meteorite craters on the planet .
they reckon that the explosion from the impact would have been like 200 nuclear bombs going off at the same time .
some guys discovered it scouting for an ore company in 1947 .
imagine being the first person to see it .
hey come on , let's go .
you right?
this is great ben .

in this place .
nowhere else .
maybe it was .. drawn to something in the earth .
like when lightning strikes .
hmm .
yeah?

sometimes take out 50 head in an afternoon .
i wore out 5 bolts on a . 303 one year !
pigs , now pigs were different .
you have to get in close .
get the dogs onto them .
then you go in with a knife .
you had to get in under them , you know , while the pig is fighting off the dogs .
and you had to be quick or you'd lose your guts on it's tusk !
