no way my old man was gonna spring for the fees .
hey , you're working for it , and you're learning your way around a boat .
i put myself through college working on boats .
beats flipping burgers .
yeah .
can i play too , or is it just for boys?
so who's washing your jeep this weekend , mr. lombardo?
the senior car wash , remember?
washing that old jeep of mine is a waste of time .
not at all .
how about if nicole and i do it?
we're working as a team .
i tell you what .
i'm going out to the glades saturday .
why don't you come over sunday and wash all the mud off .

i was counting on my mom to give me a ride , but she's not here .
surprise , surprise .
so i was wondering if you could give me one .
mr. lombardo , you really wouldn't want me to walk , would you?
i mean , like , something bad might happen .
what about you , you need a lift?
yeah , but i got my bike .
hey , no problem .

sam the philanthropist .

oh , yeah , that thing .

mr. lombardo , we're running kind of late .

are you sure?
oh , frankie .
oh , god .
oh , god !
oh , god !
goddamn it !
hello , this is blue bay high school .
hello .
your son or daughter was absent today , monday ...
jesus h. christ !
what?
oh , nothing .
come on .
art , this is a hell of a fish you caught .
it's a barracuda .
if you weren't so busy chasing booty ... ... you'd have come with me and caught one for yourself .
don't tell me you're gonna eat this thing .
why not?
it's a barracuda .
it's poisonous .
it'll kill you .
shit , man , i could say that about most of the girls you date .
sandra van ryan for sam .
sandra , what's up?
kelly skipped school today , sam .
have you heard anything?
not a word .
never mind .
i found her .
pull !
listen , sam , it was really good seeing you the other day .
sandra , i'm real busy right now , so ...
i haven't found anyone who can handle my boat the way you can .
yeah , well ...
i know you're fucking barbara baxter .
so what?
so maybe i'm a one woman man now .
aw , poor sam .
really think you'll get one of these blue bay women to marry you?
are you finished , sandra?
grab a clue , honey .
you're a hired hand , a good lay .
that's as far as it goes .
enjoy it , while it lasts .
goodbye , sandra .
pull !
you seem to find guns therapeutic .
maybe i ought to try it .
so let me guess .
some boy didn't call and screwed up your whole weekend .
so you're taking the day off .
right?
which one of your deck hands is that?
whichever one i want .
okay , kelly , what's the matter?
what is it?
i miss dad .
jesus .
i miss him too , sometimes .
no , you don't .
he didn't have to kill himself , kelly .
oh , kelly ...
i don't know why he did it .
i really don't .
can i ...?
can i get you anything?
do you want a valium?
i was raped .
what , honey?
i can't hear you .
i said , i was raped .
what?
i was raped ... ... by sam lombardo .
sam lombardo?
my daughter does not get raped in blue bay !
and you're saying that sam lombardo raped her?
that son of a bitch must be insane to think he can do this to me .
we understand your feelings , miss van ryan ... ... but please , we need some time with kelly .
we'd like to take her statement alone .
are you all right with this , baby?
yeah .
okay .
would you like to take a break for a minute?
i just wanna get it over with .
we'd like to videotape this statement .
i know this isn't pleasant , kelly , but these are serious charges ... ... and we need to know everything that happened between the two of you .
are you ready?
he started rubbing my shoulders .
i let him .
i mean , he's a nice guy .
the next thing ... ... his hand was in my shorts .
you know , from behind .
his fingers ...
his fingers ...
take your time .
they were in me .
both places , you know?
did he put himself inside you?
yes .
i said " stop .
i screamed .
i mean , that's how it sounded in my head .
he hurt me .
did you try to fight him?
well , he had my wrists pinned behind me .
then what?
he kept saying , " let it happen .
let it happen .
and then he just stopped .
you mean he withdrew?
i don't know .
it's really hard to remember , exactly .
try , kelly .
i know one thing he said .
he said , " don't worry .
i didn't come .
i can't forget that .
he said , " no little girl can ever make me come .
no little girl can ever make me come . " jesus .
too bad .
we might have had some physical evidence .
what?
maybe there's no physical evidence because nothing happened .
you want my gut?
there it is .
i think she's acting .
i think she set it up to be alone with him so he'd come on to her .
she's upset because he didn't .
maybe she set it up that way .
maybe not .
the guy never should've had her there in the first place .
the line i have on him , he's done half the women in blue bay .
that doesn't make him a rapist .
what about asking her to take a polygraph?
what about asking the pope to take a piss test?
this is blue bay , gloria .
ask a van ryan to take a lie detector test and tom baxter will cut you down .
you afraid of tom baxter now?
you afraid of sandra van ryan?
end of discussion .
you both know what to do .
start with his neighbors , coworkers .
talk to kelly's friends .
you know what that'll mean for him .
yeah .
and you heard kelly's statement .
the guy's dirty .
bring me a case .
all right .
good work , jimbo .
i'll see you monday .
all right .
that's what's left of my sailing class .
talk to me , artie .
kelly van ryan is accusing you of rape .
jimmy told me .
apparently , i'm the last one to know about it .
sam , i ...
sandra van ryan has been on the horn all day ... ... with every member of the school board .
she's pushing for suspension .
and the board's just gonna roll over for her without hearing my side?
this is insane .
i'm innocent , goddamn it .
you gotta believe that .
all i can tell you , sam , is hang in there .
they clear you , you get reinstated ...
you never get clear of something like this .
it stays with you .
it follows you around forever .
you're gonna need some help , sam .
you're gonna need an attorney .
right .
and maybe you can tell me which attorney in south florida ... ... is gonna wanna go up against the van ryans in court .
i'm here to see ken bowden .
do you have an appointment?
oh , yeah .
sam lombardo .
okay , then .
mr. bowden , your 10 : 30's here .
will you show him in , please?
what brings you to this part of town?
well , i was , until yesterday ... ... a guidance counselor at blue bay high school .
a student there is accusing me of rape .
male or female?
the student is kelly van ryan .
as in sandra van ryan?
as in , i'm fucked .
why don't you tell me about it?
shit , where do i begin?
start with ... ... your relationship with the girl , kelly .
she's a student .
i was her counselor .
beyond that , there's no relationship .
you got nothing to worry about .
what did you do to your neck?
this?
i don't have to wear it all the time .
there was an insurance guy around here earlier .
all right , let me tell you how i charge .
georgie , hey .
we gonna catch some wind?
mr. lombardo , i'm afraid i can't park your car today .
you can't park me?
i'm meeting barbara for lunch .
can you get this parked , georgie?
we're running late .
right away , mr. baxter .
you're finished here , lombardo .
take a hike .
barbara , let's go .
maybe you didn't hear me , lombardo .
you're finished in blue bay .
i find you around my daughter again , you'll be finished , period .
get the fuck out of here .
mr. lombardo , please .
that's all right , george .
sam , honey .
haven't seen you in a while .
welcome back .
rum and coke .
hey !
are you all right?
i'm fine .
cool?
that's too bad , motherfucker .
sam?
lombardo?
whoa , man !
it's me .
sorry , man .
things have been getting a little weird around here .
i can see that .
come on in .
you're sure this frankie condo guy is the guy that did this to you?
it was him , all right .
he was driving sandra's range rover .
you tell that to the cops , we can go after sandra van ryan right now .
forget it .
the lady has deep pockets .
believe me , i know how deep her pockets are .
i thought i might be able to save my house .
some sort of equity loan .
guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
i don't need any more trouble from this woman .
you think making some sort of statement's gonna stop her?
with the shit i got on kelly?
yeah .
a year ago ... ... when her old man blew his brains out ... ... kelly lost it , ran away .
they found her in a fleabag motel some place , coked out of her gourd .
meanwhile ... ... you , sam , are voted educator of the year ... ... or some crap .
they put the two of you in front of a jury ... ... they're gonna look stupid .
they know it .
why do you think they haven't taken your statement yet?
because they're busy looking for dirt .
and they're not gonna find it .
right?
ken , i don't fuck my students .
he's just showing off for you now .
hey there , ruby .
i see you still got walter .
i was hoping something had eaten him by now .
can i help you with something?
suzie called us .
where would we find her?
you know the way .
you won't shoot her , will you?
i don't believe she's armed .
yeah?
jesus , it took you guys long enough .
what if someone was trying to strangle me or fuck me in the ass?
i mean , you guys do sex crimes , right?
my partner , detective perez .
it's cline .
he's okay .
he had a good line on what cheap fucks people are .
yeah , so suzie , you called us .
remember?
did they arrest mr. lombardo?
no .
will they?
i don't know .
that bothers you?
i wanna go outside .
when was this that sam lombardo gave you the ride?
about a year ago .
and when you arrived at your trailer , was anyone there?
nope .
so you were alone .
yeah .
did he come in with you?
i guess .
you guess .
well , did he or didn't he?
okay .
yeah , he did .
and then what?
did he touch you?
did you maybe flirt with him a little?
suzie , look , i know you feel bad .
just tell us the truth .
i didn't say a thing to him .
he just put his arm around me and told me i was pretty .
i could be really pretty , he said .
did you ask him to stop?
shit .
what difference does it make?
no one believes me anyway .
did sam lombardo rape you?
yeah .
okay?
he did .
he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me .
now are we done?
almost , suzie .
almost .
at some point , were you able to fight him off?
no .
he stopped by himself .
okay?
is that it?
leave me alone .
don't touch me !
all right , take it easy .
take it easy .
he stopped .
and that was it?
he just left?
yeah .
he did say one thing first .
what was that?
he said , " no little bitch can ever make me come .
open the gate .
hey , counselor , how about a smoke?
hello , jinxy .
you know , it's really a bad news , good news situation .
you were denied bail , but you got a real attorney ... ... instead of a public defender .
i'm telling you , ken , i'm innocent .
you are preaching to the choir .
you're not alone .
so you're the new chicken licker .
sandra , can we get your comment?
can i just have your feelings at this time?
mr. lombardo will get what he deserves .
can you tell us anything?
are you confident about the case?
very .
yes .
the lombardo rape case has galvanized the upscale town ... ... of blue bay with its tabloid appeal .
now just arriving , sandra van ryan ... ... jet set real estate heiress and part of the powerful blue bay elite .
and the girl from the wrong side of the tracks .
in the end , the jury ... ... must choose between the words of these 18 year old girls ... ... and that of sam lombardo .
reporting from the courthouse steps , i'm nancy duerr .
eyewitness news .
the state of florida v. sam lombardo .
the honorable sylvia b. waxman presiding .
all rise .
we gotta stand up .
please be seated .
now sit down .
would you like more time , kelly?
i know that this is hard , kelly ... ... but i have one more question .
and even though it's something we've been over ... ... i want us all to be very clear about it .
kelly , when you saw that mr. lombardo ... ... intended to have sex with you ... ... what were your exact words?
what did you say?
i told him " no .
i said , " stop , mr. lombardo .
please .
i screamed for him to stop .
you screamed for him ... ... to stop .
and did he?
no .
he raped me on the floor of his shitty house .
thank you .
it's day two of the lombardo rape case and the second alleged young victim ...
it's day two of the lombardo rape case and the second alleged young victim ... ... of the former guidance counselor has taken the stand .
yesterday , kelly van ryan delivered an emotional account of events ... ... and was not swayed by defense counsel's cross examination .
we'll come back live later with an update of these proceedings .
reporting from the courthouse steps , i'm nancy duerr ... ... eyewitness news .
good morning , everybody .
ms. toller .
when you were ... ... picked up for shoplifting your freshman year at blue bay ... ... and you were allowed to make one call ... ... you called mr. lombardo .
isn't that correct?
ms. toller?
yes .
and when you were expelled ... ... for destruction of school property ...
i broke a fucking window .
and it wasn't even my fault .
ms. toller , you will wait until you are asked before responding ... ... and you will refrain from using profanity in this court .
it was mr. lombardo who appeared with you in lieu of a parent conference .
is that right?
yes .
it seems to me ... ... that mr. lombardo was your friend .
he was .
but all that changed when ... ... according to your testimony ... ... mr. lombardo ... ... raped you ... ... on april 23 of last year , is that right?
yes .
but then in may ... ... when you were arrested for possession of narcotics ... ... and again allowed a phone call ... ... you called mr. lombardo .
so what?
so what?
so what?
oops , suzie .
so one month after you say this man raped you , you go to him for help?
sounds as if you still considered mr. lombardo a good friend .
i needed help .
i'm sure you did .
but mr. lombardo wasn't there this time .
it was summer , he was gone ... ... and you spent six months in a state correctional facility .
did that make you mad , suzie ... ... that sam was gone?
that he wasn't there?
is that why you're saying these things about mr. lombardo ... ... your friend?
i said them because they happened .
ms. toller , are you gonna sit there today , under oath ... ... and swear that samuel lombardo raped you?
i said he did .
let me ask you a question , ms. toller .
did you enjoy being a guest of the state?
because i promise you , if you are lying about this ... ... and i believe you are ... ... that you will be visiting that facility again quite soon .
which is why i'm gonna ask you again now , under oath .
suzie ... ... did samuel lombardo rape you?
ms. toller , you will have to answer the question .
ms. toller .
goddamn it !
this was not my idea .
objection , your honor .
ms. toller is clearly responding to defense counsel's badgering .
court would like to hear what ms. toller has to say .
ms. toller?
sam lombardo didn't rape me .
he didn't rape kelly either .
he didn't do anything .
this is ridiculous .
the witness has been threatened by defense counsel !
i think i made it plain this court intends to hear ms. toller's story .
ms. toller .
i just wanted to hurt mr. lombardo .
he was my friend at first .
and then i got busted , and he didn't stick up for me ... ... and i had to go away to that hell hole .
it's like you're his favorite , and then " who cares?
make her stop .
when kelly said that we should do this ... ... i thought , " cool .
kelly !
all these big shots screwing me over , like that cop , duquette .
now they're gonna get screwed .
i'm sorry , your honor .
i have to object .
your honor , please , may i be heard?
mr. baxter , you are not trying this case .
go sit down .
kelly's pissed at mr. lombardo too .
she's in love with him .
he's been her fantasy since her old man died .
then she found out he was doing her mom , and that was it .
what?
kelly !
you skanky bitch !
get your fucking hands off of me !
don't you know who i am?
i'm gonna have you fired on monday !
right this way .
just get the hell away from me .
jesus , man !
let loose !
i'm just thinking about where i'm gonna stay .
i lost my house .
waking up from a goddamn nightmare .
you'll get over it .
we have got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker lawsuit ... ... against sandra van ryan .
just like that?
just like that?
these people ruined your life , bro .
i told you they were gonna go too far .
they went overboard !
they did !
they'll settle .
believe me .
they'll be begging to settle .
oh , yeah !
here we go !
hey , wait up !
come on , girl .
in a startling turn of events , sam lombardo has been dismissed ... ... following a reversal of testimony by one of his alleged victims .
excuse me .
over here .
excuse me .
can anybody read?
hey !
sandra !
i want you to nail that shyster's balls to the nearest wall .
we could have , if ms. not so bright here ... ... hadn't thrown things .
fuck off .
i cannot believe you're just gonna let them get away with this shit !
all on the word of one little white trash bitch .
i don't think you get it , sandy .
your princess here committed perjury .
it'll be all i can do to keep her fucking little ass out of jail .
well , what are we going to do?
you're gonna love this place , tom .
thank you .
that jalapeo pork platter will kill you .
i mean , you can't eat sushi every day of the week .
bowden , why don't you cut the crap ... ... and tell me what your client really wants .
okay , baxter .
my client wants your client to saddle up ... ... so we can ride her ass straight to the bank .
you know , ken .
may i call you ken?
there will be other cases , other days .
the way i see it ... ... tommy ... ... is that everybody's gotta eat some shit sometime .
you like yours hot?
yeah .
here's your coffee , sam .
thank you .
ken .
sorry i'm late .
hold my calls , lenore .

hey , my man !
this is for you .

yeah .
thanks .
i know there's a part of you that wishes none of this had happened , but it did .
so take the money and enjoy yourself .
all right?
find a happy place .
lenore , would you see mr. lombardo out , please?
goodbye , sam .
bye , lenore .
