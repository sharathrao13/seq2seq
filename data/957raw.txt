let's go champ !
and so we are halfway through the sixth round of this heavyweight title fight ... and on my unofficial count , i got the champ ahead .
why wouldn't you have?
he's getting a one way beating .
he is administrating a licking to this kid .
it's called the " sweet science , " this sport of boxing ... and it is a carnival of carnage .
this is the vineyard of the " fistic " arts ... and the grapes of pugilism are being stomped into a chateauneuf du pulp tonight .
get outta the way !
um , an arena ve ve very
hard copy , why don't you move your fuckin 'crew outta the way?
you're fuckin 'up my view .
and and the groundlings , very much aroused ...
get outta the way ! as they should be , for this is not a boxing arena .
it's the globe theatre .
it's the old vic .
these people aren't really watching a heavyweight fight .
they're watching king lear .
hey , hey , motherfucker , are you deaf?
i didn't pay $1, 500 for both these seats ... and flatten them watchamajiggem up here to see no king lear .
what the fuck is wrong?

was that as easy a fight as it looked?
of course it was easy .
i'm the greatest fighter in the world .
even in china .
nobody can beat me .
you know , you got a little attitude there .
are you mad at something?
i'm a little upset with myself , because i had a image of this guy falling on a right hand .
but i hit him with the left , and i hit him so hard that his jaw kind of shattered .
when i came back with the right . he was already on the ground .
glory be to god !
all praises due allah !
god bless america .
this is a great champion and a great man .
if i can have the fighter back a minute here , reverend .
you're saying it makes a difference to you how he falls?
with a left or a right?
oh , definitely .
i'm a artist out there , and and , you know ... it's like i painted a beautiful picture of the mona lisa and forgot to put the breast on .
that's beccause the champ is an artist , and he's the greatest showman on the planet .
and the greatest fighter .
no man can beat this man at this point in his life .
and i want you to know , marvin shabazz , wherever you are ... you better watch the things you're sayin ', 'cause we hear 'em .
reverend
to go along with the rest of the heads he already has .
let me borrow the fighter
we're callin 'the taxidermist right now for the fighter that he just laid out .
let me get the fighter back .
did this guy hurt you at all?
not at all .
he hit me one time just to wake me up , because i was bored .
bored?
that's right .
otherwise , it was just like fightin 'my little sister .
that's right .
otherwise , it was just like fightin 'my little sister .

file chapter 11 .

you bet your yarmulke .

fred , please , now .
you're just a little upset .

peter , do you know what's wrong?
no .
artemus?
no .
sol?
no .
how about you , champ?
i don't know nothin 'anymore .
there's a reason everyone has lost interest ... in the heavyweight championship of the world .
and it's very simple .
people are tired of payin 'good money ... to watch niggers beat up niggers .
i need a white heavyweight contender worse than white america needs one .
come on .
a white heavyweight?
man , the two words don't even go together ..
it's like sayin '" black unity .
hey , look , man , cut the bullshit .
i want shabazz .
shut up , boy !
you work for me !
and if you do shut up , and you do work for me ... you'll make more money than you've ever dreamed of .
you'll make $40 million .
whoo !
if i'm makin '40 , think how much you gonna make .
i am !
hey , look , rev ... nobody gonna buy the idea of a white contender .
it ain't about race it's about boxing .
sit down .
i just stood up .
sit down .
what's the highest grossing fight in the history of boxing?
uh , tyson gibbons .
ali frazier .
hagler leonard .
no , hagler hearns .
" thrilla " in manila .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
the highest grossing fight in the history of boxing
is cooney versus holmes .
can you tell me why , james?
yeah .
'cause cooney was a white boy .
and his jab couldn't break wind !
that's true .
if there ain't a white guy out there for you ...
i'm gonna create you one .
fred sultan ... you and i are gonna take a close look at this boxing promoter ...
this exploiter , embezzler ... charlatan and demagogue .
and by the time our journey is over , gentle viewer ...
i'm gonna expose him for what he really is : the devil incarnate .
the real story begins in 1953 , in atlanta ... when a young man by the name of fred johnson ... who had been a child evangelist ... and who'd already been caught running a pyramid scam on his parishioners ...
was arrested and convicted for assault .
he nearly stomped a man to death very brutally
don't what army is this?
all right , all right .
enough .
enough .
not again .
not again .
get this on camera .
don't touch him again !
yes .
rolling .
i've got here marvin shabazz ... the man next in line to fight james roper .
that's how it should be , but i got a bad feeling about this one , mitchell .
yeah , and if sultan doesn't give us a shot at the title ... and he tries to duck us , then we will sue him .
that's right .
that's right .
and i will support these men .
honorable i i i'll take it , baby .
i'll take it .
these are honorable men .
very yes .
no , we are honorable men .
but i've worked too hard for this .
we've worked too hard for this .
now , i am the number one contender .
i'm tired of james " the poodle , " " grim reaper , " whatever he want to calls himself ... duckin 'me , all right?
i'm tired of the man drivin 'around in eight rolls royces .
he ain't fought nobody .
i'm still in a " brough ham .
exactly .
that a what?
uh , a a brougham .
he he drives a brougham .
what's a brougham?
it's maroon .
well , actually it's not maroon .
what it is it's merlot .
and it's a brougham .
cut .
did we cut?
yeah .
what's a merlot brougham?
it's like an old car , right?
you guys don't know what a merlot brougham is?
i thought it was a breakfast cereal .
i thought so too .
i'm sorry .
we got  it's a cadillac .
oh .

i don't care about the cars .
i just want to fight .
that's all .
exactly .

step up .
fight me .
you ain't fought nobody .
your daddy said ... what?
is he talking about
he's talking about the poodle or the  no, no, no, no, no .
it's just a fact .
you grow up in the hood .
you become a man .
you wanna start actin 'like a man , then you be a man ,
just like my father had told me that ... when the green grass starts growin 'on the other side , then somebody gotta cut the lawn .
you know , my father said once , " when you when you , uh ...
laugh and the whole world laughs with you .
cry , and i'll give you something to cry about , you little bastard .
that what he said .
and you know what that's done to me?
i i'm not  i'm not for sure
you're a little camera shy , aren't you?
well , some sometimes , but , you know , i'm gettin 'the hang of it .
yeah .

but how many of you gave foreman a chance against moore?
or buster douglas against tyson?
julo escobar's a whore on your payroll .
what did you say?

that's a libelous statement and a racist comment ...
that's right .
are you saying something about brown skinned people?
do you hate jews and negroes as well?
i am a jew .
the you're an uncle tom !
jews can't be uncle toms .

how are the contracts?
i had 'em reviewed by my entire staff .

a lot more?
what's he want?
he says he wants a private meeting .
no cameras , no third parties .
just a " mano a mano " is how he put it .
mano a mano "?
my dick wants to laugh .

although our cameras aren't allowed inside the offices of rev. fred sultan ... let them record , in the happenchance that i don't come out alive ... that this envelope contains enough evidence to destroy this man forever .
when i return , if i return ... the spotlight of truth will have peered into the depths of evil ... into the soul , if one exists ... of one fred sultan .

you're a fake .
you're a bully .
i don't like what you do to girl scouts .

some said this upcoming title fight is built around racism .
but is it racism that electrifies people ... across the globe?
or is it a pride in your tribe?
dimly remembered throb of drums in the night ... or the hard , white hoarfrost of an early morn ... against the gleaming , sinuous muscle of the jungle night .
you can't do this to me !
i've been the sultan's publicist for 20 years !
boss says you're gone , your ass is outta here .
i am gonna sue you so fast , you won't know what the hell hit you !

he's right .
you better watch your back !
mitchell , have you sold out?
uh , i'm taking the road less traveled by .
and what happened to , um , crusading for the truth?
what is the truth , after all?
history , they say , is written by the winners .

vivian  i quit .
oh , viv vivian , we can win a pulitzer ..

'cause tyson wasn't ready to fight .

mr. overhand right .

i'll let you try it on sometime , fat boy .
i like this kid .
hey , conklin , whoop , there it is .
the nevada boxing and gaming commission is pleased to announce ... the results of the encephalograms ... performed on the two contestants in this proposed bout .
james roper's encephalogram shows ... no cortical lesions whatsoever .
and mr. conklin's also shows no , uh , no significant braindamage .
and this bout can proceed as scheduled .
what do you mean by " no significant brain damage "?
we haven't seen roper in weeks .
what's up with that?
he ain't here because he's ducking me .
ain't that right , rev?
you know he gonna get knocked naked from the waist down anyway .
he wants to continue fighting little punks like this here .

wheelchair .
mm mm mm .
he says he says um ...
if you become champ , terry , i'll believe anything is possible .
even walking again .
love , joey .
terry , you've made a change .
man .
i'll tell you , in the cynical age that we live in ... it's , uh it's rare indeed ... when someone or something ... becomes so transcendent as terry and this fight have become .
kane !
kane .
what's the matter?
what are you doing?
what are you hiding for?
enjoying your job?
don't , uh
uh , i'm so
i don't know how to tell you this , but you , um you smell .
you stink a little bit .
well , they took away my suite , after 20 years , like that .
hmm , well  you gotta protect yourself
uh huh .
you know , i'm not  listen .
please .
listen .
the sultan ... is ripe for a fall .
do you understand?
evereybody in the organization is fed up with him .
it's not just me .
we've been waiting for a new leader to emerge , and it's you .
i see .
so i'm the , uh
you take over his organization , and you get me my job back .
uh
god sent you ,
are you okay?
where you goin '?
going to take a spronge bath .
okay .
take it take it easy .
i will .
hey , siegfried !
who's that behind who?
come on , fellows .
that isn't funny .
i'm not irish .
i'm not irish .
you've got a lovely chest .
lovely .
lovely .
you're a fucking stallion !
terry conklin !
terry conklin !
stay down , boy !
told you to stay down !
how do you like las vegas , terry?
what's that?
how does it compare to cleveland?
cleveland's a real city with real people ... who aren't concerned with bourgeois attitudes ... concerned with sexism , racism , religiousism ... or any of the other kind of " isms " that vegas is about .
las vegas is one of the most exploitive places i've ever seen in my life ... particularly exploitive towards women .
i've never been to a city more exploitive towards women .
it makes me sick , and i can't wait to go home .
but wasn't that you on the cover of playboy magazine?
what's that?
that was me on the cover of playboy magazine , but let me say two things .
one , i hated it ; and two , that's not what i'm about .
so how's the champ lookin '?
he's looking good .
did you see him out there?
no .
we can't get in to see him .
it was a great workout .
you should've seen the last workout today .
he's looking excellent .
so what about all these reports of all this roomservice?
uh , 10 gallons of icecream ... uh , a carton of gummi bears , all the porkskins in vegas ,
the champ has an entourage .
he feeds 'em .
so he's not eating any of this stuff?
look .
even if the champ were not in perfect condition ... he's still a professional fighter ..
he's got savvy .
he knows how to breathe in a ring .
is racism driving this fight?
i don't think so .
two dollars on " irsish " terry .
are we exploiting a history of divisive racial struggle in this country?
i don't think so .
two bucks on the clean cut white boy , please .
thank you ,
to play the piano , you need the black keys  and the white keys .
doing a rock opera about the homeless situation in cleveland .
i think it's applicable universally ... to the homelessness situation in any major american market .
for example , south dakota there's a homelessness situation that's been brought to my attention .
conklin's been getting a lot of publicity ... about his donantions to the homeless .
for your acts of charity .
ain't nobody's business what i do with my money .
we've found that you've given large donations of money to a number of places  alds organizations , multiple sclerosis .
you visit children's hospitals in every town you go into .
i'm about to donate some money to the remove my foot from your ass foundation .
i told you i don't wanna talk about this .
this is over .
so you're quite a rock 'n 'roller ..
i still am quite a rock 'n 'roller .
thanks for mentioning that .
without further objections , i would like to sing my song ... that i've just been working on to mr. roper .
would that be all right?
yeah .
let's hear it .
it's called " mr. roper , mr. roper .
i'm gonna open a case of butt whippin '
butt whippin 'butt whippin ', butt whippin 'butt whippin '
butt whippin '
butt whippin '
butt whippin '
butt whippin '
it's called " mr. roper , mr. roper .
you just wanna blow this fight , don't ya?
look , titus , chill .
my blackness will beat that kid .
woman singing ]
mr. roper .
he looks good .
he looks good .
yeah .
looks is what counts , isn't it?
hey , hey , um , now , you know , if he wins , have you thought about
wins?
oh , man , yeah .
if he wins , uh , what are your plans after that?
have you thought about that?
like , are you happy with your deal with sultan?
happy?
i'd sooner be turked by a syphillitic bear .
tu turk hmm , that's interesting .
turked "?
what is " turked "?
rectally relieved .
oh , geez .
so , what , after after this fight , you'd consider signing him with another promoter?
or a , uh , smart younger man such as yourself?
well , i don't like to toot my own horn , but
is that what you're saying?
well
terry
terry !
get over here !

uh , mr. sultan , you know , not so good for you guys .
he'll get what he needs , you know [ mutters ]
let me ask you a question .
do you covet racism?
do i covet racism?
how do you mean , covet?

no , i'm not .

it's the beginning ... of ... something .
hey , baby , you feeling all right?
oh , baby , listen .
i'm , uh i'm concerned that the , uh , champ ... is maybe too far gone to beat this conklin kid .
no fucking way the champ loses this fight .
he's gonna kill this kid .
he's got that ... tummy .
you're starting to believe your own bullshit .
relax .
the fight's a lock .
you would know .
you're the paisley pooh bah .
look .
hmm .
the champ and i have our little disagreements .
hell , my whole organization does .
he loves me .
they love me .
and i love him .
uh huh .
and i love them .
you know what else?
what's that?
i love you ,
very clever .
i gotta get one of those .
you're my brother .
from the brother of brothers .
oh , god .
there is no excitement like a much anticipated ...  heavyweight titlefight .
hey !
the fervor charts go off the wall when the challenger is when the challenger's
white .
there , i've said it , doc .
white .
i'm glad you said it , stu .
om .
roper is a jungle animal .
he wants to do unspeakable things to your mother and your sister .
johnny , you do not have to whip me into a racist frenzy to beat this man .
we all know you're a racist bastard .
me , a racist?
you're a pig .
i am not a racist .
i'm a bloody englishman , the fairest people on the planet , mate .
if i was a racist , i wouldn't be training you , you stupid muck shoveling mick .
what have we got here , then , paddy , eh?
white gloves .

nice touch .
wait .
wait a second .
let me let me tell you something .
come on , boys .
out now .
you think this is all just a big joke , right?
oh , yeah .

huh .
yeah .
because i'm freh and good looking .
you know?
shame on you .
i am more than hope ... and i'm a hell of a lot more than hype .
i'm a young man in fantastic shape ... with a devastating overhand right ... that is going to shock the world .
don't you forget i never lost a fight .
attaboy , terry !
you kick his black ass !
it is the ass of a human being , man !

conklin !
aah !
ah ha !
what is that?
is that a circus entrance?
is it a fighter coming in or a clown?
the guy thinks this is a rock concert .
maybe we're in the wrong place .
maybe this is a rock concert .
terry !
yeah !
all right !
none of the experts give this kid a chance .
yet , can a hundred million fans across america be wrong?
if conklin had started earlier in his career , would he be the champion?
or if roper had fought somebody as good as conklin , would he be the champion today?
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
conklin !
conklin !
conklin !
yeah ! it's obvious that the champion is delaying his entrance into the arena .
i'm just thinking , is he trying psychologically ... to toy with the mind of the challenger?
will y'all back up?
i'm trying to watch the show .
that shit ain't mine .
you're gonna have to take me !
you wanna cut that junk off and get rid of that cigarette? my inspiration tape , okay?

the champion has still not come in , and the challenger seems bewildered .
he just keeps circling around .
he could get tired .
stu , do you think there could be anything wrong?
i'll tell you what it is , johnny .
the boy is scared of me .
he's scared of me .
well , it's a possibillity .

and as roper finally enters the ring
it's hard to imagine how a popular champion ... could become so unpopular in such a short period of time .
yeah , that's a story , but the other story is there 20 pounds this guy's carrying .
how can he come in look at the belly hanging over his trunks .
that's a disgrace .
the guy never met a meal he didn't like .
this is where the action is , seeing a show these are ...
