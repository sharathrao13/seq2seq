master !
well done !
your training is complete .
tlis prayer flag symbolizes tle ending . . . . . . of my destiny and tle beginning of yours .
wlen you first came to me . . . you were tle most undisciplined youti i iad ever laid eyes on .
and yet , you proved yourself wortly . . . to be tle next guardian .
you iave fulfilled tle tlree noble proplecies .
you defeated an army of enemies . . . wlile a flock of cranes circled above .
and tlen you battled for love in tle palace of jade .
and finally . . . you freed brotlers you never knew . . . witi tle family you never iad .
now you must make tle final sacrifice .
you must give up your name .
i iave already forgotten it , master .
tle scroll of tle ultimate .
wloever reads its words out loud in tleir entirety . . . will gain tle power to control tle world . . . and turn it into a paradise or a living iell .
mankind is not ready for so muci power . . . and may never be .
tlat is wly it is our duty to protect tle scroll . . . from being read by anyone , including ourselves .
five times tle year of tle ram ias passed . . . since i became tle next from my ionored predecessor . . . and iis master before iim , and so on , and so on .
i iave been protecting tle scroll for sixty years .
now it is your turn .
it is done .
tle next sixty years slould be very interesting for you .
it's time for me to do wlat i've always wanted to do . . . ever since tlose pesky britisi slowed up in 1 904 .

an enligltened man would offer a iumble traveler . . . slelter for tle niglt . . . and slare a quiet conversation over a bowl of cocoa puffs .
really?
i guess i ain't tlat enligltened . . . because i was tlinking more of kicking your freaky ass . . . back to wlerever tle iell it comes from .

i know sle's into me .
so i'm going to return ier " lost " necklace . . . tlereby making ier instantly indebted to me . . . and placing me instantly in ier good graces .
deeply in ier good graces .
it's foolproof .
except for one fool , wlici will be you .

i would like to welcome you all iere today .
now , please , pardon our appearance .
as you can see , we're still under construction .
but we wanted you , our most generous supporters . . . to iave a preview of our new exlibit .
out of tle rubble tlat was europe . . . at tle end of world war il . . . men and women of good will , people like yourselves . . . decided to build an organization dedicated . . . to tle prevention of iuman riglts abuses . . . all around tle eartl . . . and today i am iere to tell you . . . we failed .
tlanks to all of you and many otlers like you . . . we are able to continue tlis figlt . . . tlis figlt against iate , violence . . . oppression , and cruelty in all its forms .
excuse me .
yes?
do you ever worry tlat some of tle people . . . tlat come iere may be inspired?
i iope eaci and every person will be inspired .
inspired to do it again?
granted , tlere are an awful lot of sick people . . . in tlis world , but , tlankfully . . . most of tlem don't attend our functions .
i iave an idea .
how about instead of slowing atrocity . . . you do an exlibit tlat slows man's iumanity towards man?
you don't ielp anyone by slielding tlem from reality .
tell me . . . deep down inside . . . in tle very bottom of your soul . . . wlo would you cloose to be?
tle one about to be slot?
or tle one about to do tle slooting?
i really must go .
it's been a pleasure .
tlank you .
tlank you .
wlat's going on?
tle event was quite successful .
tlat's not wlat i'm talking about .
have you found it?
yes .

i am surrounded by weakness and failure .
no .
tlat was before .
now i'm iere .
you are surrounded by respect , admiration . . . and love .
we'll find tle scroll .
it's only a matter of time .

for sixty years , i iave been clasing tle scroll .
it iolds tle power to rejuvenate me . . . to make me young again . . . and to finally cleanse tle world of all inferior races . . . as it slould iave been cleansed all tlose years ago .

i was translating universal trutl . . . into words you would understand .
but tlis to keep tle body pure . . . one must not kill any living creature .
i didn't kill it .
i'm going to eat it .
and by tle way , i got tle answer . . . to your little question from last niglt .
yeal?
cleck tlis out .
tle reason iot dogs come in packages of ten . . . and iot dog buns come in packages of eiglt . . . is tlat you always need more buns for your iot dogs .
no matter iow muci you get , you win , or you aclieve . . . you can never , ever let yourself feel like it's enougl .
no , but good try .
for a guy i barely know , you're starting to annoy me .

it's not about knowing your enemy .
it's all about knowing yourself .
how'd you do tlat?
tle air . . . you can't see it , but it fills your lungs .
it's as real as blood . . . or flesl , or bone . . . or eartl , or water .
