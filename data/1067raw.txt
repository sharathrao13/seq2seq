hello .
father o'flannagan?
i brought your special friends from the center !
happy birthday !
janey's making faces .
it smells in here .
okay , make a wish , dear .
no .
this isn't a typical high school .
at john hughes , there are no cliques , no exclusive social groups .
you're accepted for you , not who you hang out with .
we'll divide into groups so you can get to know your peers .
let's get all you jocks in one group ... ... and get you slutty girls over here by me .
hey , how you doing?
welcome .
you losers should hang out in the back .
that clearly includes you .
come on , get back there .
take a look at the kid standing beside you .
they're your only friends for the next four years .
okay , let's move it , people !
you need to start dating .
i don't date .
you know that .
janey , you know dad's rule .
i can't have sex before you .
i don't conform to typical high school norms .
i read sylvia plath , listen to bikini kill and eat tofu .
i'm a unique rebel .
more like you're a lesbo .
mitch , leave your sister alone .
thank you , daddy .
if janey wants to be a rug muncher , that's her decision .
go !
fight !
win !
nice combination , crissy !
i've been meaning to get that fixed .
later , dad .
i'll be late to pick you up .
why?
a job interview?
no , honey .
i'll probably just be way too drunk .
that's good .
no drinking and driving .
oh , i'll be driving .
i'll just be too drunk to remember .
okay .
bye , daddy .
bye , pumpkin head .
oh , my god !
get out of the road !
oh , my god , it's jake .
hi , stud .
hi , jake .
i love that thing with his eyebrows .
those sideburns .

we're pathetic .
how will we ever lose our virginity by graduation?

amanda becker .
she is so perfect .
keep dreaming .
what's up , reggie ray?
i can't wait until friday's game .

she graduated four years ago .
hi , jake .
catherine .
can i ask you a question?
why is it when i tell a guy to put it anywhere ...

on their chest .
oh , that is whack !
priscilla , there you are .
jake , i need some t to the fourth power y.
some time to talk to you .

his name is les ... ... and he's the most beautiful thing i've ever seen .
and so is his bag .
janey briggs , please report to the office .
being a foreign exchange student is scary ... ... adjusting to a new school , a new country .
but you'll find that the students are very accepting .
i am so happy to be in america .
you have a sunny disposition .
you got your schedule?
i don't need it .
i come to school to be object of lust ... ... for poor nerds who cannot get american pussy .
well , isn't that wonderful?
janey , come in .

sweet , dude .
for the thousandth time , i said , " swallow that thing .
am i right?
how could priscilla dump me , jake wyler?
who does she think she is?
prom queen , material .
austin , she's an illusion .
you take away the makeup , the clothes ... ... the way she wears her hair , the smell of her perfume ... ... that cute face she makes when she's tonguing my balls ....
look , she's replaceable .
given the right look , the right boyfriend ...
... any girl could be prom queen .
i smell a bet .
jakey , jakey , about to make a big ... ... mistakey .
i'll pick the most hopeless girl at this school ... ... and i'll bet that you can't turn her into prom queen .
you're on , austin .
i'll bet you lose that bet ... ... but learn a much more valuable lesson , and win .
in life , that is .
you're both on .
all right .
let's find you a prom queen , mr. let's find me a prom queen .
what about her?
baby's got back .
hunch , that is .
no , way too easy .
i have no pigment any girl with a guitar is hot .
i need sunscreen
even a hippie albino .
she could be prom queen .
what about the fratelli sisters?
so they're slightly disfigured and connected .
but combined , those two make up one pretty decent chick .
i'd do them !
i know , reggie ray .
i'm looking for somebody really messed up .
i'm talking about a real shitbomb .
well , bombs away .
no , no , no , anyone but her !
not janey briggs .
guys , she's got glasses and a ponytail .
she's got paint on her overalls !
what is that?
there's no way she could be prom queen .
damn , that shit's whack .
aim for the head !
can you imagine what they do in there?
holy cow .
guys , get your heads out of the gutter .
it's a locker room .
it's no sexier in there ... ... than it is in here .
molly , can you help me take off my panties?

shakespeare , molire ... ... oscar wilde .
these were humorists .
i'm gonna be sick .
the sublime poetic genius of a clever turn of phrase .
that is true comedy .
heavens to betsy .
your modern , moronic , feeble minded , sophomoric excuse for wit ... ... is merely a parade of nasty ... ... filthy , vulgar ... ... human excrement !
excuse me .
hey , janey .
what's up?
excuse me?
ever want to be the most popular girl in school?
anorexic , superficial?
a whore who lacks any real long term goals?
exactly .
if you're interested , i thought we could go out sometime .
be seen in public .
we haven't spoken in four years .
actually , more like six .
that time when we were in line at that theater ... ... l was actually saying " hey " to the person behind you .
friday's championship game is against north compton ... ... and that squad always tries to bring it .

i don't care what coach reckons .
you can't go through life being scared .
if you do , you'll always wonder , " what if?

i didn't get to practice .
after all the shenanigans you pulled last season ... ... thank god you're still in goddamn uniform , goddamn it !
if my parents hear i got detention , no dessert for a week .
we've disgraced ourselves and our families .
i sense the morale's a little low .
i say we make a pact ... ... right here , right now .
before the end of the year , we all get laid !
we always make that pact .
we've been waiting for this since puberty .
two weeks ago !
i just got first hair on ball .
i don't think you understand .
we'll become the masters of our sexual destiny .
no longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused .
no longer steal grandfather's porn .
no longer will we use blindfolds when we jerk each other off .
all right , that's it .
what in god's name is going on?
what was that ruckus?
i no hear ruckus .
i heard a ruckus .
can you describe this ruckus , sir?
you better watch your tongue , young man !
we were just sitting here .
you just bought yourself another detention .
that's not fair .
cry me a river , dickface .
you bought another one .
eat my shorts .
what was that?

don't mess with a bull .
i'm shaking .

i got you for the rest of your lives .
you're mine .
next time , i'm cracking skulls .
how many times have i said i'm not going to princeton?
i'm not pressuring you .
just give it four years .
if you don't like it , you can work at my firm .
i don't want your life !
that's okay , son .
i heard about what happened with priscilla .
the good news is ... ... l've got the perfect rebound girl .
really?
beverly !
could you come in here?
that's mom !
what do you say , kiddo?
i'm gonna leave you two alone .
make me proud , son .
so , you in love?
yeah , i think i am .
well , who is this guy?
his name is blane .
he's a senior .
he's so beautiful .
janey?
sweetheart?
hi , daddy .
is something wrong?
you were quiet at dinner .
you were passed out on the table .
listen , honey ... ... l may not always be coherent or conscious ... ... but i know when my girl's got something on her mind .
well , there is this popular boy , jake .
oh , sweetie .
jake knocked you up , didn't he?
no , he asked me out .
do you like him?
are you attracted to him?
i mean , would you give him head?
he is kind of cute , but ... ... he's always been a total jerk .
it's weird that he's talking to me now .
especially after you've packed on a couple of pounds .
what do you think i should do?
look , sweetie .
i never want you to do anything that compromises who you are ... ... because you're very , very special to me .
if jake is only asking you out to get into your pants ... ... well , then i'd say ... ... go out with him .
you could certainly use the popularity points .
and if jake likes you ... ... then maybe those kids'll quit throwing bags of shit on the porch .
i feel better .
thanks for the advice , daddy .
that's what i'm here for , pumpkin tits .
i need to ask you a favor .
it's about time .
no , not that .
you're the cruelest girl in high school .
you're the only one who can help trick janey into liking me .
that girl with the glasses and the ponytail?
don't forget the paint covered overalls .
well ... ... it's going to be difficult .
but i think i can help you .
sit .
for a price .
and this time , i don't want your car .
i want you .
catherine , that's disgusting .
you're my sister .
only by blood .
what is wrong with this family?
hey , do you want my help or not?
there are three things you need to do ... ... to have janey eating out of your hand .
first , you earn her trust .
come on , leave him alone !
hey !
come on , guys , back off .
that's enough , okay?
you little shit .
don't you guys mess with him again .
once you've got her trust , it's time to make her feel special .
pick a song with hername in it .
that always works .
she's got a gun !
janey's got a gun !
take it easy , miss .
wait .
get back here !
hold her down .
give me your hand !
just give us the gun , janey .
afteryou've made her feel special ... ... it's time to put the icing on the cake .
i'm really glad you showed up , janey .
the only reason i came here was to tell you to leave me alone .
you know , i was just making a snack .
you want one?
no .
listen , jake
i'll be right back .
hungry?
i don't like sundaes .
it's not a sundae , it's a banana split .
i don't like those , either .
goodbye , jake .
i left some money on the kitchen counter .
emergency numbers are by the phone .
no parties .
i know , dad .
keg coming through .
hey .
what's up , man?
we're trusting you , preston .
where do you want the speakers?
in the dining room .
you guys should hit the road .
i'm taking your ferrari to buy hookers .
we'll call you later to check in .
i'll be so high , i won't know where the phone is .
that's my boy .
jake , what are you doing here?
i'm taking you to preston's big party .
i can't .
i'm not dressed to go to a party .
i'm a complete mess .
i'd say you're one big fucking train wreck .
do i know you?
that's it .
i've got it .
what?
it might seem crazy , but you'll have to trust me .
that's it .
i did it .
i'm a miracle worker .
gentlemen ... ... may i present to you the new and improved ... ... janey briggs .
congratulations .
you just got your first slow motion entrance .
i'm okay !
janey?
come on out of there , honey .
quit farting around .
got your mom's car keys?
check .
sleeping bags .
check .
condoms .
check .
three pubescent libidos to take us on a series of wild adventures .
check !
road trip !
we here .
gentlemen , tonight we go to our first high school party .
this is the place to buzz the brillo .
how you plan on buzzing brillo?
with this letter .
i've loved her since i first saw her .
welcome to the party .
if you're going to have sex , do it in my parents 'bedroom .
does she go to our school?
it's not even the same person .
janey stainey stained pants overalls?
how did you talk me into this?
priscilla's freaking out now that janey's lost her ponytail .
i'm going to go fuck a complete stranger .
hey , i'm a complete stranger .
relax , all right?
it's going to be okay .
nice turtleneck .
what's your name?
i'm sandy sue .
limp dick fag fucker !
who told you that?
alison?
alison was bitter when we broke up .
completely fake .
yeah , that's not her real hair color .
she's wearing the same outfit as me .
it looks much better on you .
where is she?
i thought she'd be here by now .
what's going on?
we can't talk until she starts moving again .
she took forever this time .
what are you doing here?
what do you mean?
i'm supposed to be the only black guy at this party .
damn .
shit .
yeah , i know .
it's whack .
my bad , man .
take this .
thanks .
do your thing .
peace out , brother .
honest mistake .
hi , my name is catherine .
yeah , i know .
we just had sex five minutes ago .
not scoring any cock , either?
cock?
i've never even been kissed .
what up , my yellow brothers?
chinks in the house !
reggie ray , have you seen janey anywhere?
it's a good night for smoking .
ain't that right , sausage?
okay , now close your eyes and wet your lips .
are you for real?
do you want to learn or not?
i guess .
see?
that wasn't so scary .
it was nothing .
okay .
let's try again .
only this time , i'm gonna stick my tongue in your mouth .
and when i do that , i want you to massage my tongue with yours .
and that's what first base is .
okay .
eyes closed .
that was cool .
now ... ... have you ever eaten pussy before?
you call this a party? !
i'm a golden goddess !
show us how drunk you are !
go for it !
you're a unique rebel , janey !
janey , are you all right?
i told you not to let me drink .
i gave you a nonalcoholic beer .
what the hell are you doing here?
i was invited .
look , you may have lost those glasses and that ponytail thing ... ... but you're still a loser .
look at that .
oh , my god .
that's going to stain .
you're not going to cry now , are you?
look , you can't just start a slow clap at any old time .
you gotta wait for the right moment .
when is it the right moment?
you'll know .
nobody's allowed down here .
janey , i just thought
how did you get in here?
i deadbolted the door .
there's a hole in the side of your house .
who's that?
it's my mother .
you have her eyes .
she died when i was 6 .
i'm sorry .
i remember it like it was yesterday .
christmas , 1 989 .
dad had been fired from the zipper factory .
mom was pulling in tricks to make ends meet .
daniel day lewis won an oscar for my left foot .
and all i wanted was a little betsy wetsy doll .
i remember those .
push her belly , she'd piss all over herself .
she said she was going out to get my dad a bottle of gin ... ... but i knew she was going to get me that present .
it was raining really hard that night ... ... and the roads were slippery .
oh , god , janey .
a car accident .
no .
cancer .
cooking and cleaning and breast feeding mitch .
it's in the past .
think about your future .
look how talented you are .
i have this dream ofjust hopping on a plane and going to paris .
there's an art school but i can't afford it .
unless i raise $26, 000 before the admissions cutoff .
my parents give a scholarship to girls who can't get into art school .
really?
that's amazing .
this year we gave it to lupe , the mexican finger painter .
i think you'd really like her work .
sometimes i wish my life was a fairy tale ... ... and some guy would come and take me away .
my eyes were shut .
and we couldn't even
i'm going to go .
okay .
congratulations to the men and women nominated forprom queen .
think you'll be prom queen?
well , think again , janey .
you put the " ass " in " embarrassment .
the " boo " in " taboo .
and the " suck " in " iiposuction .
is that the best you can do?
no .
you also put the " brat " in " bratwurst .
and the " eew " in " jujitsu .
and the " ism " in " this is all just a defense mechanism .
so i told her , " take the old lady and send your mama back .
so , you asked your four eyed circus freak to the prom yet?
we resent that !
why don't you just drop it , austin?
jake made a few paint stains in his pants thinking about janey .
it's just a bet .
okay , man?
you always had a thing for ugly girls ... ... mr. i have a thing for ugly girls .
you mean janey?
she looks as good as a dumpster full of gristles .
bling bling .
janey briggs ... ... is hot .
hey , janey .
hey , jake .
i've been doing a lot of thinking ... ... and there's something i want to ask you .
i don't want to make a big deal of it ... ... so i'm just gonna lay it out there , okay?
here it is .
see , i don't like making big speeches .
i'm a straight shooter .
i call them like i see them .
what you see is what you get .
ain't nobody gonna break my stride .
ain't nobody gonna slow me down .
jake , are you trying to ask me to the ...?
yeah .
i'd love to go with you .

but chances are , one night i'll get wrecked and have sex with some girl .
you'll call me a slut .
