the feeling begins .
very tender , very loving .
then the pain starts .
claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up ... ... just before they reach my eyes , they dig in .
and i remember .
first i fasted for three months .
i even whipped myself before i went to sleep .
at first it worked .
then the pain came back .
and the voices .
they call me by name .
jesus .
who is it?
who are you?
why are you following me?
are you ready?
no more crosses .
we're ready .
where is your mind?
do you hear what i'm saying?
the messiah won't come that way .
what do you mean by that?
who told you?
you're a disgrace !
romans can't find anyone to make crosses , except for you !
you do it !
you're worse than them !
you're a jew killing jews .
you're a coward !
how will you ever pay for your sins?
with my life , judas .
i don't have anything else .
don't turn away .
look at me .
with your life .
what do you mean?
please , judas .
i don't know .
are you still taking the cross?
yes , i am .
no , you're not .
i won't let you !
i won't let you .
please , i beg you , don't get in the way .
what way?
what's happened to you?
i'm struggling .
with who?
i don't know .
i'm struggling .
i struggle .
you collaborate .
traitor !
you are the people of israel .
your children are watching .
you are the people of god .
he is judging us .
he is watching you .
there he is .
kill him !
don't touch him .
get away from him !
don't you defend him .
he's my son .
god is with us .
he's judging us .
fight !
god help us !
god give us strength !
come .
come with me .
this man , naked before you now , is condemned for sedition ... " ... for lifting his hand against rome .
sedltio
he rallied the people to revolution .
he promised that a messiah would come from among the people ...
... to rise up and destroy rome .
rome is nothing .
murder ...
... betrayal ...
... looting and so on , and so therefore , he is condemned to die .
rome condemns him .
and all the gods of rome condemn him .
god is our shield .
he is our shield .
he is our heart .
he is our heart .
he is our shield .
he is our shield .
he will not abandon you .
he will not abandon you .
god !
god loves me , i know he loves me .
i want him to stop .
i can't take the pain .
the voices and the pain .
i want him to hate me .
i fight him .
i make crosses so he'll hate me .
i want him to find somebody else .
i want to crucify every one of his messiahs .
you're sure it's god?
you're sure it's not the devil?
i'm not sure .
i'm not sure of anything .
if it's the devil , the devil can be cast out .
but what if it's god?
you can't cast out god , can you?
who's that?
who's following me?
is that you?
magdalene .
magdalene .
thank you , lord ... ... for bringing me where i did not want to go .
he must be one of gods angels .
he came down to show me the way .
who's out there?
who is it?
what are you doing here?
i want you to forgive me .
i've done too many bad things .
i'm going to the desert , and i need you to forgive me ... ... before i go , please .
i see .
you sit out there all day with the others ... ... and then come in here with your head down , saying , " forgive me .
forgive me .
it's not that easy .
just because you need forgiveness , don't ask me to do it .
i'm sorry get out !
go away !
look , mary ... ... look at this .
god can change this .
god can save your soul .
he already broke my heart , he took you away from me .
and i hate both of you .
hate me , blame me .
it's all my fault , but not god's .
don't say that about god .
who made me feel this way about god?
i know , that's why i'm here .
it's why i want you to forgive me .
i'll pay my debt .
i know ... ... there are some things i've done , and to you .
pay or go away .
don't you remember?
no , i don't remember .
why should i?
nothing's changed .
say the truth .
if you want to save my soul ... ... this is where you'll find it .
you know that .
you're the same as all the others , only you can't admit it .
you're pitiful .
i hate you .
here's my body .
save it .
save it .
is that the way you show you're a man?
turn away , don't look at me .
you never had the courage to be a man .
don't look at me !
if you weren't hanging on to your mother , you were hanging on to me .
now you're hanging on to god ... ... going to the desert to hide because you're scared .
go .
whenever i see you , my heart breaks .
i do remember when we were children .
never have i felt so much tenderness toward anyone ... ... as i felt toward you then .
all i ever wanted was you .
nothing else .
what do you think i wanted?
please .
stay .
is it so bad sharing a prostitute's room?
i won't touch you .
you'll still be a virgin for the desert .
mary , i'm sorry .
i can't stay .
welcome .
this way .
do you always pray this late at night?
it's a funeral .
the master of the monastery died .
shall i pray with you?
sleep .
you must be tired .
i know who you are .
that was the man who brought me here last night .
last night?
he was dead last night .
the master's soul has gone to heaven .
his body's work is completed .
it walked under the sun and the moon ... ... over sand and stone ... ... sinned , felt pain ... ... yearned for heaven .
we commend his remains to our god .
flesh ... ... the master no longer needs you .
melt away .
first came the wings , then the angel .
his spirit actually appeared to you .
he treated you like a royal visitor .
he recognized you for something .
he couldn't have recognized me for anything .
i only came here to serve god .
that's all .
that's all god wants from me .
i'm sure of it .
think of how you're blessed .
god actually makes himself known to you .
i don't know what god wants from me .
all my life i've wanted to hear god's voice .
i've dedicated my life to him .
sometimes ... ... i think i feel him , but i'm never really sure .
but you always know .
god took you by the hand and brought you here .
you think it's a blessing to know what god wants?
i'll tell you what he wants .
he wants to push me over !
can't he see what's inside of me?
all my sins .
we all sin .
not my sins .
i'm a liar .
a hypocrite .
i'm afraid of everything .
i don't tell the truth .
i don't have the courage .
when i see a woman , i blush and look away .
i want her , but i don't take her , for god , and that makes me proud .
then my pride ruins magdalene .
i don't steal , i don't fight ... ... i don't kill .
not because i don't want to , but because i'm afraid .
i want to rebel against you , against everything ... ... against god , but ... ... i'm afraid .
you want to know who my mother and father are?
you want to know who my god is?
fear .
you look inside me and that's all you'll find .
but the more devils we have inside of us , the more of a chance we have to repent .
lucifer is inside me .
he says to me , " you're not the son of king david .
you're not a man , you're the son of man .
and more , the son of god .
and more than that , god .
do you want to ask me anything else?
everything is from god .
everything has two meanings .
jesus , my sweet jesus .
i forgive you .
leave me !
they've gone .
you have to leave , too .
no , i have to stay .
no .
you've been purified .
god has just blessed you .
the snakes came from inside you .
now you have to leave , too .
you have to go back ... ... and speak to people and share your heart .
speak to who?
to anyone who will listen .
and say what?
just open your mouth .
do you love mankind?
i see men and i feel sorry for them , that's all .
that's enough .
i've got orders to kill you .
go ahead .
tonight i was purified .
i can't fight with god anymore .
here's my neck .
cut it , i'm ready .
what are you?
what kind of a man are you?
what you want , i want .
that's why he brought us together , it's god's plan .
i come to kill you and you help me , that's god's plan?
these voices you hear , it's god's voice?
only you understand it?
you'd better make me understand it , too .
i'll tell you as much as i know .
the fainting spells , the voices , the visions .
power .
magic .
is there some secret?
tell me your secret .
pity .
pity for who?
yourself? .
pity for men .
our enemies are men .
i feel pity for everything .
donkeys ...
... grass , sparrows .
and ants?
you feel pity for them , too?
yes .
everything's a part of god .
when i see an ant , when i look at his shiny black eye ... ... you know what i see?
i see the face of god .
you're not afraid of dying?
why should i be?
death isn't a door that closes , it opens .
it opens and you go through it .
if i don't kill you , what happens?
i'll speak to people .
what are you going to say?
i'll just open my mouth and god will do the talking .
maybe god didn't send you here to kill me .
maybe he sent you here to follow me .
just so there's no mistake .
i'll go with you until i understand .
but if you stray this much ... ... from the path , i'll kill you .
it's magdalene .
she deserves it .
get out of there .
get out of the way !
this is not your business .
do you want to get hurt?
did you hear what he said , idiot?
move !
no .
i don't want this .
listen to him .
he doesn't want this .
well , we want it .
why?
we don't have to tell you why !
i've had enough .
we live in a whorehouse .
she's a jew .
she works on the sabbath .
she goes with romans on the sabbath .
she broke moses 'law .
she dies .
who has never sinned?
who?
which one of you people has never sinned?
whoever that is , come up here !
and throw these !
i have nothing to hide .
good .
take this .
it's bigger .
be careful , zebedee .
there is a god .
he's seen you cheat your workers .
he's seen you with that widow , what's her name?
judith .
judith .
aren't you afraid god will paralyze you if you lift that stone?
that your arm will wither?
that you'll lose all strength?
god has so many miracles .
what ifl say the wrong thing?
what ifl say the right thing?
come closer .
come closer !
we're all a family .
come closer , so you can hear .
i have something to tell you .
who is he?
it's jesus from nazareth .
nothing good can come out of nazareth , even the scriptures say so .
i'm sorry , but ... ... the easiest way to make myself clear ... ... is to tell you a story .
a farmer was planting in his field .
some seed fell on the ground and the birds ate it .
some seed fell on rocks and dried up .
but some seed ....
some seed fell on rich soil ... ... and grew into enough wheat to feed a whole nation .
can you hear me?
we can hear you fine .
i'm the farmer .
the farmer is me .
and 2 and 2 makes 4 .
another lunatic !
rabbi ... ... tell me , if you're the farmer ... ... and we're the stones , what's the seed?
what's the seed?
love .
love one another .
that's easy to say , maybe that's good advice , but for some other world .
these people are starving .
first you feed them , then you talk !
i used to think god was angry , too , but not anymore !
he used to jump on me like a wild bird and dig his claws into my head .
but then one morning , he came to me .
he blew over me like a cool breeze and said , " stand up .
and here i am .
and you will go to hell .
these are children's stories .
how can they help us?
what are you hungry for?
what are you thirsty for?
for justice !
and bread !
bread , too .
you're thirsty for justice , for people to treat you fairly ... ... for people to treat you with respect .
what i'm telling you is ... ... whoever's hungry for justice , they are the ones who'll be blessed .
they'll be filled with bread .
they'll never be hungry again .
they'll have the real value , the value of love .
to love , share and comfort .
they'll have the courage to do the good .
and you .
you're mourning .
mourners will be blessed .
you'll have god to comfort you .
you won't need men to do it .
and the meek .
they're the ones who'll be blessed .
and the suffering , they'll be blessed , too .
and the peacemakers and the merciful ... ... and the sick , and the poor , and the outcasts ... ... you'll all be blessed because heaven is yours !
and believe me ...
... believe me , those who are laughing now ... ... will be crying later .
those whose stomachs are filled now will be hungry later .
and the rich will be poor forever !
kill them !
i didn't say death !
i said love !
i said love !
enough .
come .
no , father , i'm staying .
we have to work .
i need you !
come .
i'm sorry , father , i'm staying , too .
not the two of you .
come on !
let me come with you , i can help .
stay here .
you'll know when .
tell people about me .
james .
andrew .
move over , john .
move over , james .
i was just comfortable .
peter wants to lay down .
peter , there's no more room .
i'm cold .
i want to be by the fire .
go over by philip .
we're all cold .
shut up .
rabbi , can i talk to you?
i'm not like these other men .
i mean , they're good enough , they're good men .
but they're weak .
one's worse than the other .
where'd you find them?
look at me .
if i love somebody , i would die for them .
if i hate somebody , i'd kill them .
i could even kill somebody i loved if they did the wrong thing .
did you hear me?
do you understand what i said?
yes , i understand .
the other day you said , if a man hit you , you'd turn the other cheek .
i didn't like that .
only an angel could do that , or a dog .
i'm sorry but i'm neither .
i'm a free man .
i don't turn my cheek to anyone .
we both want the same thing .
we do?
do you want freedom for israel?
no .
i want freedom for the soul .
no .
that's what i can't accept .
that's not the same thing !
first you free the body , then the spirit !
the romans come first .
you don't build a house from the roof down but from the foundation up .
the foundation is the soul .
the foundation is the body .
that's where you must begin .
if you don't change the spirit first , change what's inside ... ... then you'll only replace the romans with someone else , and nothing changes .
even if you're victorious , you'll still be filled with the poison .
you've got to break the chain of evil .
how do you change then?
with love .
who's there?
it's me , andrew .
is everything ....
it's all right .
go back to sleep .
judas and i are talking .
there's an example .
you know , the zealots ordered me to kill you .
why did you change your mind?
i decided to wait .
for what?
i thought maybe you were the one .
to unite us .
i didn't want to destroy that .
how do we know?
how could i be the messiah?
when those people were torturing magdalene , i wanted to kill them .
and then i opened my mouth ... ... and out comes the word " love .
why?
i don't understand .
i can't look to the others for answers , all they do is follow you .
we'll go to judea and see john the baptist .
every day he tells hundreds of people the messiah is coming .
he'll know .
he'll know .
i'm afraid .
stay with me .
behold !
i will raise up evil against you out of your own house ... ... and i will take your wives , before your eyes ... ... and give them to your neighbor , and he shall lie with your wives ... ... in the sight of this sun .
you may listen and listen again ... ... but you will never understand .
you may look , but you will never know .
these people's wits are dulled .
their ears are deafened and their eyes blinded ... ... so they cannot see with their eyes , nor hear with their ears ... ... so that they may turn and be healed .
on this day ...
he sounds like the messiah .
no . " ... i will crush the horns of the new moon and i will spill darkness over the world .
i will reverse your laughter , turn it into tears ....
go in front .
let him see you .
listen , it is the thunder of many peoples ....
even from behind , i knew i had seen him before .
where?
was it a dream?
yes , it was .
but in the dream , he was dressed in white .
you will have the smell of decay ...
... and branding , instead of beauty .
your men shall fall by the sword ...
... and your women shall sit on the ground , stripped bare .
who are you?
do you recognize me?
who are you?
do you know the prophets?
what does isaiah say?
he says , " prepare the way of the lord .
are you telling me that's you?
i don't know .
tell me .
why are you here?
to be baptized .
no , i don't dare .
if you're the master , then you have to baptize me .
baptize me .
love .
what does it mean?
love is sweet as honey .
but it's also blood .
love is action .
you want a new crop , you burn the earth .
but isn't love enough?
no !
look at the world .
look around you .
plague , war , corruption ... ... false prophets , false idols , worship of gold .
nothing is of value .
the tree is rotten .
you have to take the axe and cut it down .
if i was a woodcutter , i'd cut .
if i was a fire , i'd burn .
but i'm a heart and i love and that's all i can do .
i'm a heart , also .
but i can't love what's unjust .
what i can't love , i attack .
god demands it .
anger?
yes , god demands anger .
anger?
but we're all brothers .
you think love is god's only way?
go to the dead sea , look in the bottom .
you'll see two whores , sodom and gomorrah .
that's god's way .
on the day of the lord ... ... blood will flow from wood .
the stones of the houses will come alive and kill their owners .
that day is here .
he gave me the axe .
now i give it to you .
that's not the answer .
then what is the answer?
i don't know .
well , if you won't listen to me , who will you listen to?
god .
the god of israel is the god of the desert .
if you want to speak to him , then you'll have to go to the desert .
i'll go to idumaea .
thank you , baptist .
be careful .
god isn't alone out there .
i feel sorry for you .
you were lonely .
you cried .
so i came .
i didn't call for you .
who are you?
your spirit .
my spirit?
you're afraid of being alone .
you're just like adam .
he called me and i took one of his ribs ... ... and made it into a woman .
you're here to trick me .
trick you?
to love and care for a woman , to have a family , is this a trick?
why are you trying to save the world?
aren't your own sins enough for you?
what arrogance to think you can save the world .
the world doesn't have to be saved .
save yourself .
find love .
i have love .
look ... ... in my eyes .
look at my breasts .
do you recognize them?
just nod your head ... ... and well be in my bed together .
jesus .
after ten days ... ... the hunger went away .
welcome , jesus .
congratulations .
you're past the small temptations of a woman and a family .
were both bigger than that .
who are you?
you don't recognize me?
i'm you , i'm your heart .
your heart is so greedy .
it pretends to be humble ... ... but it really wants to conquer the world .
i never wanted a kingdom on earth .
the kingdom of heaven is enough .
you're a liar .
when you were making crosses for the romans ... ... your head was exploding with dreams of power .
power over everyone .
you said it was god , but you really wanted power .
now you can have what you want .
any country you want .
all of them .
you could even have rome .
liar .
step into my circle so i can pull your tongue out .
archangel , move back .
move back , you're blinding me .
jesus .
i'm the one you've been waiting for .
make me a god , god .
god .
god , make me a god .
but i was just a child then .
you are god .
the baptist knew it .
now it's time you admit it .
you are his son .
the only son of god .
join me .
together well rule the living and the dead .
you'll give life and you'll take life .
you'll sit in judgement , and i'll sit next to you .
imagine how strong wed be together .
satan?
well see each other again .
don't be afraid .
you are the one .
my work is done .
now i can die .
the lord wants me to tell you to stand up .
his day is here .
take this axe .
take this message to everyone .
please .
what do you want?
i'm a foreigner .
from galilee .
i'm tired .
you don't know how good this tastes .
some more wine , please .
mary ... ... martha ... ... i want to say that you're both blessed .
i came here , you didn't know me .
you took me in , fed me , restored me ... ... and god came down and went into my heart .
go on .
no .
i've talked too much already .
silence is better .
no , it's not .
do you have a wife?
no .
how can you live like that in the desert?
tell me the truth .
don't you miss all this?
having a home , a real life .
i admit it .
i'd like it , but i'll never have it .
listen , if you really want god , don't spend your time in the desert .
he's not there , he's right here .
read your scriptures .
god does not want you to fast and pray .
he wants you to make children .
mary , you're making him uncomfortable .
he's a guest .
he knows what i'm talking about .
come and help me .
it's not right to tease these men .
i wasn't teasing .
remember the baptist?
it's nothing to tease about .
the baptist?
what?
he's dead .
he was killed by herod .
you didn't know?
they say the king was drunk and cut off the baptist's head to satisfy him .
now they say they're going to kill everyone who was baptized .
no one forced you to be baptized .
you were baptized , too .
you begged for it .
so be quiet .
i can just imagine in galilee right now .
the sea .
they say the fishing's so good you just touch the nets and the fish jump in .
don't talk about fish .
it reminds me of my sheep .
i don't know what's happened to them .
maybe we should wait for him in galilee .
no , we promised the master we would wait here .
that was over a month ago .
thousands of people are waiting to see and to hear him and he's gone .
the whole movement .
we look like fools .
nathaniel's right .
he makes sense .
let's return to galilee .
if we go back to galilee , like peter says
brothers !
i don't understand you .
think of the last words the baptist said .
he said , " jesus of nazareth , leave the desert .
i am finished .
you return to mankind .
how do we know he really said that?
everybody says he did .
but how do we know?
even if he didn't , the words are important .
why?
because people believe them .
and what if our master's ....
what if he's the one?
what " one "?
the one .
what do you mean?
the messiah?
we don't know the baptist said that .
nobody knows .
he's not like elijah .
he's saying that the world of god is here now .
he just meant , " continue my work .
continue to do the work i've been doing .
right here elijah ascended to heaven .
doesn't that mean something to you?
we're waiting here .
we're waiting here .
i don't think we should go back to galilee .
i think we should wait here .
that's what i love about you , peter .
you're as steady and as solid as a rock .
nobody can change your mind .
what good are you?
master .
rabbi .
john heard your footsteps in his heart ... ... in a way , and we were preparing to welcome you .
were you baptized?
yes .
john baptized with water and they killed him .
now i baptize with fire .
ls that what the baptist told you?
i have an invitation for you .
ls there a celebration?
no .
i'm not inviting you to a celebration .
i'm inviting you to a war .
this is my heart .
take it .
god is inside of us .
the devil is outside us , in the world all around us .
we'll pick up an axe and cut the devil's throat .
we'll fight him wherever he is .
in the sick ... ... in the rich ... ... even in the temple .
i'll lead you .
if you have sheep ... ... give them away .
if you have a family ... ... leave them .
i believed in love .
now i believe in this !
who's with me?
adonai .
today and tomorrow i cast out devils and work cures .
on the third day ... ... i shall be perfected .
out !
satan , leave !
satan , out !
leave him !
moses , elijah , isaiah ... ... touch my mouth ... ... touch my lips .
go to the temple .
let the high priests see you .
look !
he was blind and jesus healed him .
look .
he was blind and jesus healed him .
look .
you don't belong at a wedding .
we're here to celebrate purity .
i'm sorry , but these people are my guests .
let me explain something to you .
what do you think heaven's like?
it's like a wedding .
god's the bridegroom and man's spirit's the bride .
the wedding takes place in heaven ... ... and everyone's invited .
god's world is big enough for everyone .
nazarene , that's against the law .
then the law's against my heart .
don't touch me .
you are now sacred to me ... ... through this ring .
you are now sacred to me , through this ring .
according to the law of moses and israel .
according to the law of moses and israel .
my cousins are very upset .
they only brought enough wine for 3 days .
now another day's gone past and it's gone .
what's in those?
water .
no .
it's wine .
no , it's water .
i put it there myself .
it's wine .
it's water .
go over there and make sure .
do it .
you're right .
it is wine .
brothers !
my old friends !
listen to me .
it's me the prophets preached about .
god talked to me in the desert .
he gave me a secret and told me to bring it to you .
didn't you hear me coming?
i ran here to nazareth , where i grew up , to bring you the news .
the world of god is here now .
you work miracles .
make a miracle for us .
make us believe in you .
otherwise go away .
the messiah doesn't need miracles .
he is the miracle .
now he's here .
are you ready for me?
i'm here to tear down everything around you .
you know what i'll replace it with?
something new .
god .
the world of god .
so take your bread and give it to the poor .
what difference does it make what you own?
you have gold and silver .
it's going to rot .
that rot is going to eat away your hearts .
all of you !
there will be a flood and a fire .
everything will be destroyed .
but there will be a new ark riding on that fire !
and i hold the keys and i open the door .
and i decide who goes in and who doesn't .
you're my brothers from nazareth and you're the first i invite on the ark .
don't wait .
don't waste your life .
come with me .
you're the son of mary , right?
who are you to tell us about god?
he made better crosses than speeches .
go get someone from his family to take him away .
he's insane .
what are you laughing at?
everything you have will burn .
soon !
get out now !
come with me to jerusalem !
see?
this is what happens when a man doesn't get married .
the semen backs up into his brain .
go home !
you're a demon .
you're possessed .
you're a lunatic !
this is my home !
you should be ashamed .
kill him !
he's going to burn us .
don't touch him !
if i could touch every stone ... ... if i could breathe on every branch , they'd get up and follow me !
so what's wrong with you?
come with me to jerusalem !
jerusalem is falling !
i feel it .
i know it .
you see these people?
they're poor .
they're blind .
they're crippled .
they're going to be our army .
we're going to need better men than this .
god will give them to me .
we're going to build a new jerusalem .
son .
come back with me .
please .
who are you?
your mother .
i don't have a mother .
i don't have any family .
i have a father , in heaven .
don't say that to me .
who are you?
i mean , really .
who are you?
why are you crying?
didn't you see them?
what?
when he spoke to you , there were thousands of blue wings behind him .
i swear to you , mary , there were armies of angels .
there were?
thousands .
i'd be happier if there weren't .
when was he buried?
three days ago .
roll away the stone .
lazarus .
lazarus .
in the name of the prophets ... ... in the name of jeremiah and my father ... ... in the name of the most holy god ... ... i call you here .
i call you here !
