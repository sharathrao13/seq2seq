i n the nick oftime too .
i couldn't take much more ofthose coconuts .
coconut milk's a natural laxative .
things that gilligan never told us .
oh .
pretty well made fire , huh , wilson?
so ...
wilson .
we were en route ... from memphis for 1 1 and a half hours .
about 475 miles an hour .
so they think that we are right here .
but ... we went out of radio contact ... and flew around that storm for about an hour .
so that's a distance ofwhat , 400 miles?
four hundred miles squared .
that's 1 60, 000 ... times pi 3 . 1 4 .
five hundred and two thousand , four
that's a search area of 500, 000 square miles .
that's twice the size oftexas .
they may never find us .
this tooth isjustkillingme .
itstartedoutjusthurting when lbit down , butnowitjusthurts all the time .
all the time .
it's it's agoodthing there 's notmuch to eataroundhere , because i don't think i could chewit .
justkeepsucking on all that coconutandall that crab .
andjust think ,
i usedto avoid going to the dentist ...
iike theplague .
iputit offevery single chance lgot .
butnow , oh , what i wouldn'tgive ... to have a a dentist righthere in this cave .
i n fact , i wish you were a dentist .
yeah .
dr. wilson .
you wanna hear something funny?
back home in memphis , my dentist's name is dr. james spaulding .
she's much prettier in real life .
shut up !
bakersfield "?
bakersfield !
this could work .
this could work .
twenty two forty four lashings .
forty four lashings .
so
we have to make rope again .
wilson , we're gonna have to make a hell ofa lot of rope .
eight lashings ofthese structurals .
that's 24 apiece .
that'll be 1 00 1 60 .
here we are today .
that gives us another month and a half until we're into march and april , which is our best chances for the high tides and the offshore breezes .
we need we need 424 feet ... ofgood rope , plus another 50 feet , say , for miscellaneous .
round that offto 475 feet ofgood rope .
now , ifwe average 1 5 feet a day
plus , we have to build it , we have to stock it , we have to launch it .
that's gonna be tight .
that is not much time .
but we
we live and we die by time , don't we?
now , let's not commit the sin ofturning our back on time .
i know .
i know .
this is it .
that's all that's left .
i checked over the whole island , and that is all that's left .
so we're gonna be short .
short .
we'll just have to make some more out ofthe videotape .
yes .
no , we have time .
we do .
we have time .
look !
the wind's still blowing in from the west .
i know !
yeah , i know i know where there's 30 feet ofextra rope !
but but i'm not going back up there .
there , there .
there , you see?
huh?
there .
are you happy?
do you have to keep bringing that up?
can't you just forget it?
huh?
you were right .
you were right .
it was a good thing that we did a test ,
'cause it wasn't gonna be just a quick little snap .
i would have landed on the rocks .
broken my leg or my back or my neck .
bled to death .
but it was the only option i had at the time though , okay?
it was what , a year ago?
so let's just forget it .
and what is your point?
well ... we mightjust make it .
did that thought ever cross your brain?
well , regardless , i would rather take my chance out there on the ocean ... than to stay here and die on this shithole island , spending the rest of my life talking to a goddamn volleyball !
shut you up .

take care , now .
tomorrow .
tomorrow we're gonna bring you back to life .
how long are you gonna be , man?
well ...
how long will that buy me?
about ten minutes .
i'm awake .
i saw your taxi drive up .
get in here out ofthe rain .
i saw you down at the hub today , so i know you were down there .
let me get you a towel .
they're sleeping .
ifyou come in , i'll make you some coffee .
it's a nice house .
yeah , we got a nice mortgage too .
what's your daughter's name?
katie .
katie .
she's a beautiful little girl .
she's a handful .
j ust let me get one thing straight here .
we have a pro football team now , but they're in nashville?
um , yeah .
oh , my god .
okay .
they used to be in houston .
first they were the oilers , andnow they're the titans .
the houston oilers are the tennessee titans?
yeah .
but that's not all .
they went to the super bowl last year .
and i missed that .
you would've died .
it was so exciting .
they almost won by one yard .
one lousyyard right at the end .
i got whole milk , 2 % and nonfat .
i don'thave anyhalf and half , andthat's whatyoulike .
that'll do fine .
what happened to you becoming a professor?
you're not dr. kelly frears lovett?
when you , um
when your plane went down , everything just sort of got put on hold .
i think about taking it up again , though .
i came out here to give you this .
oh , my god .
i'm sorry it doesn't work .
and i , uh , i kept the picture .
it was all faded anyway .
i want you to have it .
i gave it to you .
that's a family heirloom , and it should stay in your family .
that's everything lhave from whenyou went down to now .
they said they never figured out what caused the crash .
probably some mislabeled hazardous material caught fire .
so here's where that ship found you .
you drifted about 500 miles .
this is where your island was , about 600 miles south ofthe cook lslands .
and these are the search grids .
ships went back and forth for weeks looking foryou .
i never should've gotten on that plane .
i never should've gotten out ofthe car .
i wanna show you something .
come here .
this is this is our car .
you kept our car .
all right , now , this is weird .
it's a good car .
had a lot of memories in this car .
two very nice memories .
oh , that trip down to the gulf , yeah .
so , can i drive it?
it's your car .
that's good , 'cause my my taxi's gone .
um
let me get some stuff out ofthe back .
you thinkyou're gonna have more kids?
i don't know .
it's kind ofconfusing right now .
well , you should .
i mean , really , you should .
i would .
so , what now?
i don't know .
i really don't know .
you said you'd be right back .
i'm so sorry .
me too .
chuck !
chuck !
chuck !
i always knew you were alive .
i knew it .
but everybody said i had to stop saying that that i had to let you go .
i love you .
you're the love of my life .
i love you too , kelly .
more than you'll ever know .
chuck?
you have to go home .
we both had done the math , and
kelly added it all up .
she knew she had to let me go .
i added it up , knew that i'd
i'd lost her .
'cause i was never gonna get offthat island .
i was gonna die there , totally alone .
i mean , i was gonna get sick or i was gonna get injured or something .
the only choice i had , the only thing i could control ... was when and how ... and where that was gonna happen .
so ...
i made a rope .
and i went up to the summit to hang myself .
but i had to test it , you know?
ofcourse .
you know me .
and the weight ofthe log ... snapped the limb ofthe tree .
so l l
i couldn't even kill myself the way i wanted to .
i had power over nothing .
and that's when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket .
i knew ... somehow ... that i had to stay alive .
somehow .
i had to keep breathing , even though there was no reason to hope .
and all my logic said that i would never see this place again .
so that's what i did .
i stayed alive .
i kept breathing .
and then one day that logic was proven all wrong , because the tide ... came in , gave me a sail .
and now , here i am .
i'm back ... in memphis , talking to you .
i have ice in my glass .
and i've lost her all over again .
i'm so sad that i don't have kelly .
but i'm so grateful that she was with me on that island .
and i know what i have to do now .
i gotta keep breathing .
because tomorrow , the sun will rise .
who knows what the tide could bring?
