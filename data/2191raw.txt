miss , you okay?
<i>i can't remember when i had my first waking nightmare . </ i>
<i>they're too disturbing to call daydreams . </ i>
<i>i never talked about them with anyone . </ i>
<i>they never made any sense to me ... </ i> <i>then i found the pathway . </ i>
<i>now they're all clear , every one of them . </ i>
breakfast of champions .
when was the last time you slept?
<i>i'm happy i can stand , man .
i'm on a three day rage . </ i>
your father will kick your ass if you flunk anything .
since when did he need an excuse to do that?
<i>at least you're out of the house . </ i>
<i>hey , i'd trade places with you any day . </ i>
what up , jake?
darius .
<i>what's up? </ i>
so you playing ball next year?
<i> i don't know , man .
get with it . </ i>
<i>that's what you said last term , dawg . </ i>
<i>man , the guys around the gym , they tell me you're the real deal . </ i>
<i> what are you staring at?
it ain't your truck , homey . </ i>
<i> easy .
what's he got there , jake? </ i>
nothing , man .
bullshit .
let it go .
just keep your dog on a leash .
all right .
what the fuck were you gonna do , shoot him?
chill .
it only told me to scare him .
<i>" it "?
what is " it "? </ i>
just give me back the piece .
no , man , no .
are you crazy?
what , do you want to get arrested?
where did you get this?
later .
happy birthday .
the need to worship god , to protect the family ... to coexist in harmony with nature .
now , from these very ideas stories were created ... and passed down from one generation to another ... each having its own central hero character .
want to see what you missed?
<i>if i wanted to see it , i wouldn't have missed it . </ i>
campbell termed this ennobled path ...
just trying to be helpful .
what a shame .
i thought you wanted to get in my pants .
it is my birthday .
works for me .
but little more than the stories we grow up hearing ... and the tradition of telling them ... is what binds together even the most disparate of societies .
happy birthday , handsome .
<i> how does it feel to be 21?
like i'm on the verge of nothing . </ i>
mr. gray , am i interrupting a celebration?
sorry , prof. hartney .

<i> are you peaking or crying?
i've had better days , jake . </ i>

what did he say?
fuck or fail .
<i>that's got a nice ring to it . </ i>
well , i ran out of the office .
i bought myself a few days .
<i>why don't you report him?
he does this all the time . </ i>
<i> dean glick won't do anything .
why not? </ i>
<i>i'll give you one guess . </ i>
come on , huh?
shit .
<i>fuck .

<i> i didn't call for back up .
you're welcome . </ i>
so , valerie gaines , behind the gym ... senior prom .
you guys thought that we were powdering our noses .
her nose was up my skirt .
man !
<i>jake , what's our zip code? </ i>
98133 .
had you heard that one?
personally , i found it depressing .
<i>that's just because you weren't there . </ i>
exactly .
what year were you born?
same as you , dumb ass .
<i>so what's your weirdest family holiday? </ i>
<i>fuck that .
we'll be here all night . </ i>
what was your weirdest family holiday?
thanksgiving , a couple years ago .
<i>i was building a ramp for my mom's wheelchair ... </ i> and father moore came by to visit .
they were all inside watching football , dallas tampa game .
dallas lost .
that was your weirdest family holiday?
so i had a hammer in my hand ... and i look up and father moore was smiling at me ... and all i could think about is just bashing his head in .
<i>over and over , and then i'd smash my parents 'heads in . </ i>
<i>then , like , half the people i knew , just ... </ i>
so then i started thinking , what else would i like to do?
and all this crazy shit came into my head .
so then what happened?
i finished the ramp , and we ate turkey .
<i>dude , that's sick even for me . </ i>
<i>dude , i've castrated my dad 112 times in my dreams . </ i>
three of a kind , huh?
<i>let's play a real fucked up game . </ i>
<i>" welcome to the pathway . " </ i>
the pathway .
<i>i've never played this before . </ i>
<i>dakota , it's a secret . </ i>
<i>well , it's not a very good secret if you know about it . </ i>
serious .
you give it your phone numbers and stuff ... then it calls you and gives you bizarre things to do .
what kind of bizarre things?
<i>well , you don't know unless you play . </ i>
how do you start?
you already have .
happy birthday .
<i>oh , shit .
it's , like , my entire life . </ i>
wild or what?
<i>dude , you'll never be president . </ i>
turn this off .
somebody could be reading this .
nobody cares about the $243 you got left in your bank account .
abort .
fuck !
<i>god , i'm so drunk . </ i>
i need another drink .
oh , body shots .
<i> i'll be down in a minute .
enjoy . </ i>

<i>you've got to be kidding me . </ i>
you know , you owe me two weeks pay .
sue me .
<i>son of a ... </ i>

<i>your boss fires you and all you do is hit a desk? </ i>
who is this?
<i>i know what the voices in your head really tell you to do . </ i>
<i>i don't know who this is .
i don't have time to play games . </ i>
<i>you wouldn't have let conrad sign you on ... </ i> <i>if you weren't looking for a distraction from your dreary world . </ i>
happy birthday .
this is the pathway?
<i>today we find a way to get even with an asshole of your choosing . </ i>
<i> have anybody in mind?
my boss . </ i>
<i> what would you like to do to him?
kill him . </ i>
<i>you'd only be doing him a favor . </ i>
<i>enjoy your first day off ... </ i> <i>then come back tomorrow and see what the pathway does for you . </ i>
somebody order an orchid?
<i>don't expect a tip . </ i>
so you been thinking about me?
only between my dance classes .
<i> how are you doing?

he comes back last night and rips me off .
i just came by to get my money .
he owes me two weeks pay .
were you in here last night?
no .
okay .
all right .
you know what?
<i>let's check out the hidden surveillance cameras and we'll see what we see . </ i>
<i>didn't know we had those , did you , jake? </ i>
<i>i'm just going to start this from when i left here last night . </ i>
<i>what the ... </ i>
<i>that can't be me . </ i>
you doctored the tape .
<i>you little prick .
don't you see? </ i>
<i>he's goddamn smart . </ i>
god , you screwed me , gray !
<i>how'd you do it , huh? </ i>
so then who were those guys on the videotape?
<i>i don't know .
that's why i'm trying to hack into the site . </ i>
<i>well , whoever they are , i wouldn't piss them off . </ i>
yeah .
shit .
since when are you into voodoo?
<i>they're spiritual interpretations of universal ideas . </ i>
<i>that's what it said on the box . </ i>
so what did it have to say about these guys?
<i>" the figures suggest youth , love , and virginity ... </ i>
<i>" before they're corrupted by desire . " </ i>
remember taking my virginity?
if i recall , i think it was you that took mine .
details .
should we light a candle or something?
so much for cuddling .
well , jake , you got what you wanted ... and i get to keep playing the pathway .
you just made love to me because the pathway told you to?
no , jake , i fucked you because the pathway told me to .
when did you start playing the pathway?
like you care .
<i>like you've ever really given a shit about me , jake . </ i>
like any man ever has .
see you on campus .
hello .
<i>feeling distracted? </ i>
beats watching tv .
<i>are you ready for another test? </ i>
<i>i thought that was dakota's test . </ i>
<i>besides , it's not exactly our first time . </ i>
<i>with her in control it was . </ i>
i thought the point was to entertain me .
<i>no , the point was to see what's inside your head . </ i>
<i>dinner's ready . </ i>
trying to break my hand?
<i>what's the matter , you pull something? </ i>
just throw the goddamn ball .
let me see .
darius do that?
with a little help .
<i>damn it , connie , i can't baby sit you day and night . </ i>
who asked you to?
<i>don't give me that shit .
i've been covering your back since we were nine . </ i>
<i>why don't you stop already? </ i>
okay .
sorry , man .
<i>i think i'm building up a resistance to my medication . </ i>
<i>yeah , i think we're both losing it . </ i>
<i>listen to this shit .
the other night , i'm down in the basement . </ i>
i get a phone call from the pathway .
<i>i turn around .
there's a big creature staring at me . </ i>
a creature .
half man , half woman .
anyway , i have this dream where i go upstairs ... and i shoot my dad in the back of the head .
has trippy stuff like that been happening to you?
every goddamn day .
great .
<i> i'll take it easy on you .
right . </ i>
<i> hello .
jakey . </ i>
got two girls in my room .
<i> i can't get them to leave .
nice , man . </ i>
<i>why didn't you give me a shout? </ i>
<i>yeah , like i'm going to have you by . </ i>
they would have taken one look at you and kicked my ass out of bed .
is something wrong?
<i>i don't know , man .
i'm spent .
you know? </ i>
all right , dude .
be careful .
<i>why don't we get breakfast in the morning? </ i>
<i>okay .
i'll call you in the morning . </ i>
<i> hey , jake .
yeah . </ i>
fuck you .
dude , what the fuck do you want now?
<i>nobody knows how fucked up you really are . </ i>
<i>and nobody really gives a fuck , do they? </ i>
what the fuck !
connie .
<i>connie , let's go get some breakfast , bud . </ i>
or more like lunch .
connie , wake up .
uncle ross .
<i>he didn't sound good .
i should have come over . </ i>
you could have wound up dead , too .
<i>conrad wasn't a psychopath . </ i>
he was always on the edge .
this thing with darius just pushed him over it .
<i>no .
those guys would fight one day , and then they'd get high the next . </ i>
<i>i'm sure their parents will be comforted to hear that . </ i>
did you help conrad steal that gun?
what?
<i>the serial numbers matched a .
38 stolen from sid's sporting goods last week . </ i>
<i> that's impossible .
why is that? </ i>
because i threw that gun into cove lake .
you what?
<i>i took a gun from connie ... </ i>
<i>i didn't want him to get in trouble , so i threw it in the lake . </ i>
how would conrad have gotten the gun back?
<i>he couldn't have . </ i>
this is a bad time to start lying to me .
<i>i'm not lying to you . </ i>
<i>you think i don't want to find out what went on in there? </ i>
you going to tell my sister or am i?
yeah , i want to go to the hospital now , if i can .
<i>you know , i'm your uncle . </ i>
you could have brought the gun to me .
are you okay?
<i>it's the worst day of my life . </ i>
you want to talk about it?
not here .
meet me in front in five minutes .
okay?
okay .
<i>i just don't want to end up like my father . </ i>
go to work at 6 : 00 , come home at 8 : 00 .
do it all over again the next day .
what do you want to do?
i wish i knew .
have you ever thought about leaving here?
<i> who'd bring my mom orchids?
i'm sure she would love postcards . </ i>
looks like you like to travel .
yeah .
i like collecting things .
how did you end up here?
a man .
<i>sorry , i didn't mean to pry . </ i>
<i>no , it's okay .
i'm just enjoying this one too much . </ i>
so how about you?
are you seeing anybody?
took you long enough to ask .
i take that as a no .
no .
<i>but who knows , i could always run into someone when i'm not expecting it . </ i>
that never happens .
what timing .
all i want to do is leave this town , and you just got here .
we just have to meet somewhere in the middle .
okay .
well , you were right .
the day did get better .
<i>i'm sorry about your friend . </ i>
<i>so i'm going to try to play it cool and not call you for at least an hour , okay? </ i>
okay .
bye , jake .
bye .
i remember when you and connie first met in sunday school .
<i>you're drinking? </ i>
<i>well , i'm not praying . </ i>
<i>you're going to throw away five years just like that? </ i>
<i>you think i don't know what you and conrad have been doing to yourselves , son? </ i>
<i>you think i don't know that? </ i>
what conrad did has nothing to do with me .
<i>he's gone to hell . </ i>
<i>i don't have to listen to this . </ i>
wait just a minute , jake .
wait a minute .
wait .
<i>we're not going to be able to save you now . </ i>
<i>don't preach to me with a drink in your hand , dad . </ i>
you ungrateful punk .
you realize that we have sacrificed everything for you here?
sacrificed?
you sacrificed?
<i>i could've gone anywhere , i could've done anything ... </ i> but i stayed here for you , i stayed here for mom .
what did you ever give up for me?
my beautiful wife .
what does that mean?
<i> i thought i could do this , but i can't .
thought you could do what? </ i>
<i>what are you trying to tell me?
you're blaming me for the way mom is ... </ i> <i>for the accident?
you're gonna blame me for that now? </ i>
<i>the day after my best friend kills himself , you're gonna blame me for that? </ i>
<i>it's not very much , though , jake . </ i>
the day i need you the most , the day i need help , the day i need my father ... you do this?
shame on you .
jake?
<i>i don't know whether to cry or scream . </ i>
i know what you mean .
you know , i called you six times .
<i>i'm really sorry about what happened the other night . </ i>
<i>don't worry about it . </ i>
<i> so why didn't you call me back?
i was hanging out with a friend . </ i>
who is she?
her name is marisol .
<i> sounds exotic .
she's different . </ i>
<i> i'm super late .
dakota , hey . </ i>
you heard what conrad did to himself , right?
<i>can't stop thinking about it . </ i>
well , the other night , after i got off the phone with the pathway ...
i had a dream where i did the same thing to myself .
you think that the pathway has something to do with what conrad did to himself?
yeah , maybe .
are you still playing?
<i>it hasn't asked me to corrupt anyone else , if that's what you're asking . </ i>
all right .
do me a favor .
anything .
stop .
sure .
<i>come by the tomahawk tonight .
dinner's on me . </ i>
and bring your friend .
you sure you want company tonight?
no , but i like being with you .
good .
<i>okay , now i'm jealous . </ i>
marisol , this is dakota .
nice to meet you .
<i> god , marisol .
that's such a beautiful name .
thank you . </ i>
<i> what does it mean?
it's spanish for " sun and sea . " </ i>
oh , my parents named me for where i was conceived .
i would really love to stay here and chat with you guys ... but my boss is totally riding my ass .
<i>it's okay .
we're just going to do take out . </ i>
so two burgers , two fries , and two beers .
<i> we're not staying?
no .
i got a surprise for you . </ i>
now this would be the part where i get ill .
<i>sorry .
looking for the men's room . </ i>
<i>you know where the men's room is , professor .
you eat here twice a week . </ i>
so , have you thought about our little conversation after class?
<i>professor , you twist that ring any harder , and your finger's going to come off . </ i>
<i>i've got plenty more . </ i>
asshole !
<i> tomahawk .
even hartney knows you are weak . </ i>
<i>every man does . </ i>
<i>why do you think jake would never be with you for more than one night? </ i>
<i>he knows you've fucked all his friends . </ i>
<i>who wants a girl like that? </ i>
<i>i know .
it wasn't your fault . </ i>
<i>daddy was a monster . </ i>
<i>but then , let's face it . </ i>
<i>lots of girls have bad fathers , and they don't end up like you . </ i>
<i>get used to it . </ i>
<i>you let hartney fuck you over ... </ i> <i>and you're going to be working in dumps like this for the rest of your miserable life . </ i>
<i> is that what you want?
fuck you . </ i>
fuck all of you !
<i>that's my girl .
didn't that feel good? </ i>
<i>don't you understand that i want to help you ... </ i> <i>make you feel better ... </ i> <i>help you get even with hartney before it's too late . </ i>
yes .
<i>don't be afraid .
it's time to play . </ i>
when i was nine months old , my folks moved here from seattle ... <i>to be near my uncle , my mother's brother . </ i>
there was a blizzard and my dad lost control of the car .
it was a miracle any of us survived .
<i>there's a higher power looking out for you . </ i>
is she okay?
<i> i'll call her later .
we are late .
late for what? </ i>
<i>it's so worth the pain .
i promise . </ i>
i need some more medicine , nurse .
ready?
yeah .
one , two , three , go .
i hope you can fight .
i never put an orchid on a guy before .
<i>it's for my mother , walt . </ i>
<i>okay , now you're breaking my heart . </ i>
sorry .
quit smoking yesterday .
great .
jake .
what have you and your friends gotten into?
nothing .
first conrad , now dakota kills your professor and mutilates herself .
this is no coincidence .
you could be next .
i am not going to let that happen .
all right , can you take him home?
make sure he gets some sleep?
listen to me .
first thing tomorrow morning , you meet me at my cabin .
no one will disturb us there .
<i>but we're not leaving until you tell me everything you know . </ i>
uncle ross .
nine points?
<i>didn't hear you drive in . </ i>
so , how are you holding up?
fine .
yeah?
<i>what's in the ground? </ i>
<i>after a hunt , we bury the animal's remains . </ i>
native american ritual i taught jake when he was a kid .
<i>returns the animal's soul to the earth . </ i>
well , come on in .
when we started , the pathway was just a game ... that had this strange ability of knowing what we were thinking .
but then conrad used the gun that i threw into the lake ... and then cuts his tongue off ... the way that i did after a beast in a dream tells me to .
<i>so i'm thinking maybe it wasn't a dream .
maybe it isn't just a game . </ i>
<i>i feel like i'm going insane . </ i>
<i>no , i think you're just looking for an answer for something so horrible it has none . </ i>
i like it here .
<i>it's peaceful . </ i>
thanks .
well , i have to meet the fbi in my office in a couple hours .
<i>i'll ask them to check on this computer game of yours . </ i>
<i>why don't you spend the night here? </ i>
it might do you some good .
sheriff north .
what is it?
<i>something's wrong . </ i>
<i>i'm sorry , i think we ought to go . </ i>
okay .
jake , talk to me .
shit .
give rest , o christ , to your servant with your saints .
where sorrow and pain are no more .
neither sighing , but life everlasting .
you only are immortal , the creator and maker of all .
we are mortal , formed of the earth ... and to the earth we shall return .
<i>" you are dust , and to dust you shall return . " </ i>
all of us go down to the dust ... yet even at the grave we make our song .
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah .
<i>you know , you say there's a higher power looking out for me? </ i>
<i>well , i need him now .
he's not here . </ i>
jake , what is it?
i have to go see an old friend .
jacob , why this sudden interest in satan?
do you think he really exists?
many in the church take the devil quite literally ... but i think of him as a symbol of temptation , not as a beast with a pitchfork and horns .
what does it say in the bible about possession or self mutilation?
you think that your two friends were possessed?
maybe .
<i>" when jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene , he rebuked the evil spirit . </ i> <i> " 'you deaf and mute spirit , 'he said .
'i command you to come out of him . " '</ i>
again , sorry about your friend .
thanks .
so when did you stop worshipping satan?
<i>ten years ago .
i'm a christian now . </ i>
<i>it's more forgiving . </ i>
<i>why'd you even start? </ i>
<i>some folks want what god ain't giving them : </ i>
money .
power .
me?
i wanted to get laid .
<i>there's more pussy at a black mass than there is at a metallica concert . </ i>
what happens at a black mass?
people get naked .
then they sacrifice something .
a cat or a dog .
satan rewards you for killing a dog?
the more you give , the more you get .
what happens if you kill a human?
my group was more bankers and housewives ...
looking for a different kind of picnic .
do you know any people that are more devoted?
<i>you don't cross people who are willing to give up their souls . </ i>
walt , please .
yeah , i know a guy .
just do me a favor .
<i>don't tell him i sent you . </ i>
coming .
sammy .
<i>mr .
reisz , i'm jake gray . </ i>
i called about an hour ago , said i was coming by .
yeah .
i get $50 an hour for consultations .
right .
i should charge more .
the guy who fixes my car gets $80 .
barely knows where the sparkplugs are , much less how to conjure up beelzebub .
i ever sell books to you before?
no .
<i>you say it's called the " pathway "? </ i>
yes .
why?
<i>because that's what we call the connection between the devil and the possessed . </ i>
so how did i resist?
<i>we're often unaware of our strength until we're tested . </ i>
why does the devil need to use computers or games?
think about it .
<i>it's a very effective way to spread a message . </ i>
i mean , imagine if hitler had had the internet .
<i>maybe satan's found someone to do his bidding again . </ i>
<i>i've seen this man ... </ i>
in my head .
so have i.
what makes you think this guy can conjure satan?
because i taught him to .
when aidan kater came to me to learn the black arts ... he was a geek living out of the back of his van .
i stopped teaching a few years later ... but by then he was very skilled .
why did you stop?
i was going to be a father .
was?
anne kilton was a student of mine before we were married .
the pregnancy was hard on her .
she had a bad premonition ... and asked me to perform a sacrifice for the health of the baby .
a human sacrifice .
i refused .
so kater took your place .
i came home one night and found a pentagram in my yard .
there was blood everywhere .
<i>" anne must have sacrificed some kind of animal here . " </ i>
but anne was gone , too .
when they found her bloody clothes in a ditch two days later , i knew ...
aidan kater had sacrificed my wife and unborn child .
<i>i'm sorry . </ i>
what did the police say?
the police were very helpful .
they made me their prime suspect .
<i>i spent the next five years trying to prove that i didn't do it . </ i>
<i>and that's what i have left to remember them by . </ i>
an empty grave .
the devil uses the pathway to possess people .
and then forces them to kill ... and commit suicide?
she seduces them .
<i>the devil's a woman? </ i>
<i>i don't know .
it can be whatever it needs to be . </ i>
or what you want it to be?
<i>i didn't want it to be a woman . </ i>
you think conrad and dakota wanted to die like that?
some part of them did .
<i>you didn't even know them ! </ i>
<i>i'm not saying it's your fault .
i think that you're angry because ... </ i>
<i>yes , i'm angry . </ i>
<i>my friends are dead !
i'm angry ! </ i>
<i>but i'm not crazy .
this kater guy is behind this ... </ i> <i>and i gotta do something .
i can't just stand here . </ i>
what are you gonna do?
throw holy water on him?
burn him at the stake?
you believed me when i said i saw something .
i did .
i believed that you had a vision , maybe , or an apparition .
the bitch was in my basement !
okay .
you know what?
this is getting a little bit too heavy for me right now .
i adore you , but this is getting to be too much .
<i>i guess i shouldn't have come here . </ i>
<i>i'm sorry . </ i>
fucking shit .
<i>we're not going to be able to save you now . </ i>
<i>you are dust , and to dust you shall return . </ i>
<i>he's gone to hell . </ i>
where you going with those , jake?
to your mother and father?
<i>you can't do that , man . </ i>
<i>you'll ruin everything . </ i>
jake .
<i>i didn't have a choice . </ i>
neither of us do .
are we in hell?
no .
<i>but hell ain't so bad . </ i>
<i>you'll see . </ i>
you know , you remind me of myself when i was your age .
smart .
angry .
trying desperately to pretend that i was something good ... <i>but somehow deep down inside knowing you're not . </ i>
<i>i'm nothing like you .
i don't kill people . </ i>
no , you just dream about it .
is this how you got to conrad and dakota?
you mess with their minds until they do what you tell them?
it was a test .
they failed .
you passed .
you stared the devil directly in the face ... and you never looked away .
but when you finally did ... <i>we knew that we'd found you . </ i>
you used the pathway to find me?
why?
because you were stolen from us ... and we needed a way to get you back .
stolen?
by who?
those people you call your parents .
they found your mother where she was hiding on the night you were born .
she was too weak to fight them .
<i>you're insane . </ i>
you were taken from your real mother on the night you were born .
my real mother?
anne kilton .
bullshit .
anne never had a child .
you made sure of that .
every son wants to believe his father ... <i>but faking anne's death kept ivan from the truth . </ i>
you belong to us .
you always have .
anne had a plan ... but when paul and kathy interfered ... you went from being a prince of darkness ... to just another fucked up kid .
look .
your whole life is a lie .
why are you doing this to me?
why?
<i>don't be afraid . </ i>
<i>she'll explain everything . </ i>
where is she?
i know who you are now .
why?
no !
<i>there's a higher power looking out for you . </ i>
i had to make sure my son still belonged to me .
oh , god .
you had to kill before i could show myself to you .
they took you from me ... <i>but i'm sorry i had to do this to you . </ i>
<i>that isn't your blood . </ i>
drink this .
accept who you were born to be ... or go back to the life that you hate .
will you be with me?
<i>i'll be whatever you need me to be . </ i>
<i>you're a monster . </ i>
<i>my god , they think i killed them? </ i>
<i>the devil couldn't kill her child , so this is how she makes me pay ... </ i> <i>for wanting to be human . </ i>
<i>but maybe they're right . </ i>
<i>maybe there is no pathway . </ i>
<i>and this is all a fantasy i've created to live with the horrible things i'd done . </ i>
<i>wake me from this nightmare . </ i>
<i>please .
help me . </ i>
