more wine over here !
white and red wine .
take it over there .
now , bring that dish here .
more wine !
i have often wondered about the beliefs of these nations the egyptians , the syrians .
king herod ... er ... to revert to the jews .
i wonder , ... .. is it because they identify future with past that they have so many prophets?
oh , the prophets .
it's the sun which breeds them !
many are harmless .
they preach religion , we iet them go , ... .. but some of them preach rebeilion because it is written .
altogether , iiteracy has had a disastrous effect on this country .
and those we eliminate , ... .. rome has taught us that , although this may be indifferent theology , ... .. it is very good government .
majesty , i've heard the word messiah .
what exactly is a messiah?
oh , even you have heard that awfui word , proculus .
is he a prophet , or is he something even ...
weil , rome , even rome , cannot influence men's dreams .
and the messiah is a bad dream ... .. disguised as a solution to every problem .
it's a ieveiler of scores , a rewarder of righteousness , ... .. a scourge for the wrongdoer .
it is the bringer of everlasting peace !
then , as i understand it , from what you have said , ... .. a messiah is worse than a prophet , from the roman point of view .
oh , from the jewish viewpoint , too .
only you try teiling that to the jews !
no , don't .
it's wiser not to consult them just when a messiah appears .
crush it underfoot iike a scorpion !
no , you can teii great augustus that he can rest in peace in rome .
there wiii be no messiahs , true or false , in palestine while i am alive .
mary !
mary !
come down , mary !
they're waiting for you !
mary !
mary !
mary , come quickly !
child , your shawl .
thank you .
do not be afraid .
yes , here she is .
joseph .
may this betrothal , one to the other , ... .. joseph , mary , ... .. be blessed and sanctified according to the law of moses and of israel .
amen .
who are you?
who are you?
how can that be?
no man has ever touched me .
behold the handmaiden of the lord .
may it be done unto me according to your word .
mary , ... .. who are you talking to?
there's news of elizabeth .
my cousin elizabeth?
what news?
she's going to have a son in three months 'time .
she conceived the child six months ago ... .. on the nineteenth day of tishri .
but elizabeth was always barren .
now she's far too old .
what nonsense is this , child?
oh , but it's true .
she's going to have a son .
and i must go and visit her .
come , mary .
you'ii be comfortable .
god bless you , child .
here .
take this to my sister in be'er kuni and teii her i'ii be with her for passover .
aii right .
i wiil .
go safely on your journey .
where do you want this grain?
where should i put it?
mary !
i've been ionging to see you .
mary .
so it is true .
how did you know?
who told you?
a messenger ... .. from god .
and he told me another thing .
a thing even more wonderful?
you're blessed among women , ... .. and blessed shaii be the fruit of your womb .
i too am highly favoured ... .. that the mother of the chosen should come to me .
from the moment your greeting reached my ears ... .. the child in my womb ieapt for joy .
my soui doth magnify the lord !
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god , my saviour , ... .. for he has iooked kindly upon the most humble of his handmaidens ... .. and he has told me that aii generations shaii caii me blessed .
he who is mighty has done unto me a mighty thing !
is it true about mary's dream?
oh , yes .
news came that elizabeth is going to have a child .
even though she's past the age?
yes .
she must be 50 .
the wife of zacharias?
yes .
she's mary's cousin .
weil , joseph , ... .. are we going to get an invitation to your wedding?
plenty of time for that , jotham .
the contract's just been signed . just betrothed and his beloved's ieft him already . just iike her .
she's always been a bit strange .
not iike the others .
that's something you'ii have to iive with .
but seriously , joseph , mary is remarkable .
we aii think so .
a remarkable girl .
ahhh !
elizabeth is here !
give him to me , elizabeth .
blessed be thou , our lord , king of the universe , ... .. who has blessed us with your commandments ... .. and ordained us to initiate our sons in the covenant of our father abraham .
amen .
as this child enters the covenant , so may he enter into the study of the torah , ... .. into marriage , and into good deeds .
amen .
this is the seai in flesh of the covenant between the lord and his people .
what is the name of the child?
his name is ...
his name shaii be john .
when you get back to nazareth , ... .. teii joseph what you have seen and heard , what you know .
the lord god gives iife where no iife is possible .
and one iife shaii be the son of god , ... .. and the other shaii be his prophet .
go .
teii aii this to joseph .
but wiii he believe me?
wiii he believe me?
god wiii open his heart .
come on , off you go .
go on .
play somewhere else .
that's it .
it is written in the law , ... .. if , in the time of betrothal , a woman sins with any other man , ... .. iet them both be taken beyond the gates of the town ... .. and stoned to death .
that the abomination may be crushed out of the heart of israel .
should a man marry a woman and she find no favour in his eyes , ... .. because he has found in her the stain of uncleanliness , ... .. iet him write a biii of repudiation and deliver it into her hands .
this applies , even if i haven't taken mary into my house?
yes .
aii that is needed is for a biii to be written ... .. and delivered in the presence of two witnesses .
no .
if i do that , i wiii expose her shame .
i can't .
i can't .
i'ii send her away if i must , ... .. but in secret .
god knows the secret of the heart .
trust in him , and accept .
accept it , joseph .
the lord wiii not abandon you .
thank you .
oh , no ... no ...
oh ...
no ...
no !
no !
no !
joseph !
joseph , son ofdavid .
do not be afraid to take mary as your wife .
it is by the holy spirit that she has conceived .
she will bear a son , and you shall give him the name jesus , the saviour .
hey , joseph , joseph !
the bride is arriving !
mary's here !
with this ring ...
with this ring ... .. be thou consecrated unto me . .. be thou consecrated unto me .
according to the law of moses and of israel .
according to the law of moses and of israel .
may the lord bless and preserve you .
may the lord make his face shine upon you .
may the lord iift up his countenance towards you ... .. and give you peace .
amen .
ah !
census !
it's a trick to increase the taxes .
and we aii know where the money ends up in rome .
but why should it?
what does rome give us?
that's not the point .
the romans want to count us how many we are , where we are .
they want us to know that they are our rulers .
but we should have no earthly ruler .
no rule but the lord .
no king but god .
it's not for you to remind us of the scriptures .
be quiet and go home .
i apologise for my son .
he's too young to understand .
what are you doing to the faith of our fathers?
aii over galiiee are thousands of jews preparing for what you talk about in there : .. the coming of the king who'ii iiberate us .
but what are you doing about it?
nothing !
we accept rome's violence iike sheep .
come !
we are not worthy of the king to come !
stop !
the king to come wiii not bring violence .
huh?
it is written .
he himself is pure from sin .
god shaii cause him to be mighty through the spirit of holiness , ... .. and wise through the counsei of understanding .
now come home .
stay there tiii you iearn more respect for your elders .
anna .
i must go to bethlehem .
uh?
it's my native town , and ... .. and mary must come with me .
why?
for the census .
so even augustus obeys god .
the prophecy .
yes , the prophecy .
for thou , o bethlehem , art in no wise the ieast of cities , ... .. for from thee shaii come forth a shepherd of my people .
israel .
if only ...
i could come with you .
if only ... .. i ... joseph , ... .. you'ii need help ... .. when he's born .
don't be troubled , anna .
he wiii be weii cared for .
everything wiii be done as god ordered .
they seem to be kings , lord melchior , from different iands .
i told you we could not have been the only ones to see the sign .
i am sure that herod keeps a strict watch on his frontiers .
he must know that we have crossed them .
i would have to teii him , as balthazar has said , ... .. that i foilow that star wherever it ieads .
but what wiii we find?
aii my calculations showed that there was to be a new heavenly creature , a new star .
it was even precise as to place and time , ... .. so i made up my mind to set forth and seek what they would unfold .
you did not know?
only that it would be something wonderful .
the stars are not distant and aloof , cut off from the iives of men .
the rising of a new star entails an immense iabour in the heavens ... .. that always has its counterpart on earth .
the universe is about to bring forth a prodigy beyond our understanding .
your star , my brother balthazar , ... .. is indeed a sign of wonder .
the divine zoroaster says " the next prophet wiii show himself ... .. in a foreign iand , ... .. and the truth he wiii reveai wiii be at first only for his own people .
but there is only one truth .
and only one god .
aii the rest are vain , ... .. or parts of him .
the people of israei know this .
many of their wise men have been close to him .
and their writings confirm my calculations .
a king is about to be born .
look ...
mary ...
i thought i heard a baby crying .
born in a stable !
ohh ... a beautifui child !
come on , put him there in the manger , ... .. and see if there's some fresh straw that'ii keep him warm .
i'ii take care of her .
poor girl .
now then , ... .. have you some water?
give it to me .
come .
that's it .
who's that?
what do you want?
this is no place for you .
get out !
get out , d'you hear me?
off !
off with you .
can't you see?
the poor giri just had a child .
that's why we've come .
we were told to .
told?
by who?
we were out there in the fields .
this man came to us from nowhere .
an angel .
shepherds , " he said , ... .. " they say that israei is a scattered flock that iacks a shepherd .
and then he said " tonight the shepherd is born .
it is for you that he comes " , he said .
for the poor .
that's why you came here?
yes .
the man said ...
he said ...
today , in the city of david , ... .. a saviour has been born ... for you .
glory to god in the highest " , he said .
and peace on earth for those whom he ioves .
come .
they cross my border , ... .. yet not one of them sends a greeting .
are they armed?
not heavily , your majesty .
our spies say they're equipped to travei fast and far .
but they were not heading here .
if not here , where?
it was bethlehem , your majesty .
they foilowed a star .
the new star .
bethlehem?
o thou bethlehem ephratah , thou art the smailest ...
what was that phrase again?
thou bethlehem ephratah ... .. art a iittle one amongst the thousands of judah .
out of thee he shaii come forth unto me ... .. who is to be the ruler in israel .
and his going forth is from the beginning , ... .. from the days of eternity .
a ruler in israel?
have those traveilers watched ... .. aii the time .
and bring me the names of aii newborn children in bethlehem .
wait .
don't be afraid .
where is the child?
we have come a iong way to greet him .
this is the king of israel , ... .. who wiii take away the sins of the world .
i did not know where we were to find you .
and coming here ... a stable , ... .. i thought my brothers were mistaken , ... .. but now i see the justice of it .
there could be no other place .
mm .
not in glory , ... .. but in humility .
accept these poor tokens of our homage .
incense , ... .. to perfume the hails of the mighty .
gold , ... .. for kingly rule .
myrrh .
the most precious herb of the east , ... .. and the most bitter .
and now ... a word of warning .
leave here as soon as you can .
herod's soldiers have foilowed us , hoping we'ii iead them to you .
he knows of this birth .
he'ii seek out the child and kiii him .
go into egypt .
it may not be for iong .
herod's days are numbered .
have those traveilers crossed my frontier again?
yes , your majesty .
" yes , your majesty " !
but the child must stiii be here .
kiii every male child up to one year ...
no .
two years old .
better the innocent should die than that the guilty should escape .
guilty?
your majesty , a child?
guilty in the womb !
guilty in the stars !
i'ii bring down their stars !
i'ii snuff them out in blood !
this is my world !
i wiii not share it with an infant !
there's no room for two kings here !
like a newborn scorpion ... underfoot !
you know the mark of a reai king?
courage , even in the face of jewish prophecy , ... .. bits of old parchment , ... .. old blind men !
hah !
now go to bethlehem and make history !
kiil !
but , your majesty ...
kiil !
kiii them ail !
kiil !
kiii them ail !
aaargh !
aaargh !
leave my child , you bloodthirsty murderers !
argh !
no !
don't kiii him !
don't kiii him !
no !
don't !
leave me !
argh !
king herod is dead .
taken in the midst of his sins .
struck down by the lord , to whom the power and pride of kings are as nothing .
you cannot defy god .
the mighty god , the everlasting father , the prince of peace .
yet the yoke of tyranny wiii not be iifted from us .
rome wiii choose a king from among his sons , and her grip wiii become stronger .
but you should iift up your hearts , for the eternai wiii not abandon us .
he wiii send us a deliverer .
and his dominion is the everlasting dominion that shaii not pass away .
and his kingdom , that which shaii not be destroyed .
come .
there .
look .
do you see?
nazareth .
that's where we iive .
hear , o israel , ... .. the eternai our god , the eternai is one .
blessed be the name of the glory of the kingdom for ever and ever .
and thou shalt love the eternai thy god ... .. with aii thy heart and with aii thy soui and with aii thy might .
and these words , which i command thee , shaii be in thine heart .
amen .
amen .
bar" chu et adonai ha" m" vorch .
baruch adonai ha" mvorach l" olam vaed .
bless god , who has given us the torah .
the lord god will go before you .
be strong and ofgood courage .
fear not , nor be afraid , for the lord thy god will go with you .
he will not fail you or forsake you .
amen .
now you're truly a man .
shh shh shh shh . jesus bar joseph , as a new adult member of our community , ... .. you have exercised your right to read and comment upon the scriptures .
that is your heritage .
it is the heritage of the children of israel , ... .. but remember that god's word is spoken in times of iight ... .. and in times of darkness and persecution .
may you always read from the law in a time of joy .
amen .
may god protect you .
may god bring blessings on the boy .
the romans are here .
the romans?
hey , hey !
brothers !
brothers !
quiet !
romans ...
the roman soldiers are here .
the romans !
jewish bread .
better than nothing .
what's this?
quartermaster .
an army must eat , and it's a iong way to jerusalem .
but galiiee isn't roman territory .
huh !
the whole world is roman territory .
hey !
put your sword back .
ignore them .
we'ii meet with plenty of those in jerusalem .
they're cailed zealots .
they're mad religious fanatics .
you there .
remember this .
the roman army is not a pack of bandits .
and we'ii deai with the iikes of you in our own good time .
come !
may the curse of god faii upon these murderers !
how iong must we wait , o lord , for you to help us !
god has abandoned us .
how iong !
how iong !
how iong , o lord?
i grow old .
what of thy promise to the prophets , hm?
where are they?
speak tenderly to jerusalem , ... .. and teii her that her time of bondage has ended , ... .. that her penalty is paid .
salvation is at hand , ... .. to be shouted from the mountain tops .
comfort ye ...
comfort ...
god , comfort .
the teaching is clear .
behold , i send my messenger , and he wiii clear the way before me .
a messenger ... before me .
a messenger ...
and the lord wiii suddenly come to his temple , ... .. and the messenger of the covenant , behold , is here .
i am the lord unchanging , says the eternal !
and you too have not ceased to be sons of jacob !
from the days of your forefathers you have been wayward ... .. and have not kept my laws !
if you wiii return to me , i wiii return to you , says the lord !
do not think you wiii be saved by your rituals , by going to the temple !
it is not sacrifices the lord demands !
bring no more vain offerings , saith the lord .
i delight not in the blood of builocks and of iambs !
the sacrifice god demands is a repentant heart !
what do we do then to be saved?
change your hearts !
take the right way !
the lord says my ways are not your ways !
john , baptise me !
i have sinned !
you are the prophet !
sent to us by god !
i baptise you with water , ... .. that you may be purified and ready for the coming of the kingdom .
open up your hearts to god .
receive this cleansing iife .
save me , save me , john !
i have sinned !
i am a sinner !
let this water wash away your sins .
stop !
stop !
stop the procession !
message for the king !
your majesty , he's here .
the baptist .
he's here !
weil?
weil?
weil , what?
but ...
weil , er ...
ieave him alone .
oh , no .
on the march again !
continue !
oh , what harm can he do?
he's been out there for years in the desert , ... .. iiving on iocusts and prayers .
he doesn't incite the people to rebeilion .
he asks nothing for himself .
aii he wants is to remain poor and naked .
he'd very much iike everybody else to do the same !
oh , now , when the wedding festivities are over , i'ii have him preach at the palace .
you can hear him with your own ears .
he's a very remarkable man .
i am glad there is somebody remarkable in judaea .
herod !
herod !
the tablets of the law speak plainly !
you may marry the wife of your brother when your brother is dead , ... .. but not while he iives !
this woman , herodias , is the wife of your brother philip !
and philip iives tetrarch in ituraea .
i have seen thine adulteries and thine abominations .
woe unto them !
wilt thou not be made clean?
send back this woman to your brother .
repent !
how can you ailow this slander to continue?
no , no , no .
we decided to be clement on our wedding day .
i am not afraid of your power on earth , herod antipas !
if i do not warn you , you wiii die in sin ... .. and the lord wiii ask me to account for your iife !
quickly !
into the palace !
john ! john !
repent !
repent !
the lord blesses you !
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
save us !
the time has come !
the great and terrible day of the lord is at hand !
repent ... .. and change your iives .
every vailey shaii be exalted , ... .. every mountain and hiii iaid iow .
the winding ways shaii be straightened and the rough ways made smooth .
god ied you back from babylon to serve him , but you betrayed him .
now you are warned .
flee !
flee !
arrest the prophet .
i demandthat you arrest him !
demand? !
demand?
that's a strong word , my heart .
you must remember .
john is right .
by the laws of moses , ... .. we have sinned .
come on .
come on .
we have sinned .
and we go on sinning , ... .. and very pleasant it is too !
even if i wanted to , i could do nothing about his reproaches ... .. untii he once more sets foot in galiiee .
and then , ... .. my own , my heart , we'ii throw him into prison !
repent !
repent !
repent !
a iittle repenting won't do him any harm .
after ail , ... .. he preaches it .
you are born to a new iife through your repentance ... .. and the lord pours his blessings on you .
the lord rejoices in repentant hearts .
go in peace .
he wiii forgive you , if you truly mean it in your heart .
help me , o lord .
open up your heart .
be ready for the coming of the kingdom .
let your heart now be cleansed .
forgive me .
i have sinned .
help me to be strong .
be strong .
it is i who ...
who need baptism from you .
and yet you come to me .
let it be so .
we must fulfii aii righteousness .
lord , eternai father , ... .. i hear your voice .
this is my beloved son , ... .. in whom i am weii pleased .
you are born to a new iife through your repentance ... .. and the lord pours his blessings on you .
the lord rejoices in repentant hearts .
this water cleanses .
andrew?
philip?
behold ... .. the lamb of god , ... .. who takes unto himself ... .. the sins of the world .
it is him you must foilow now .
not me .
he must increase , ... .. as i must decrease .
what's happening?
they're the guards of king herod , come to arrest the prophet !
go !
go on !
john , save yourself !
come with us , please !
leave him !
he's a prophet !
you cannot arrest him !
he's a man sent by god !
my time is over .
quick !
what's going on?
why are you running?
he's back .
where's mary?
i must teii her .
mary !
mary !
oh , hurry , hurry !
mary !
mary !
mary !
mary , your son is back .
he's at the synagogue .
he went straight to the synagogue .
i saw him .
he's back !
oh !
and now our reading from the prophets .
the prophet isaiah .
who is our reader?
ah , yes .
it's my turn today , rabbi .
the spirit of the lord is upon me ... .. because he hath anointed me to give good tidings to the poor .
he has sent me to heai the broken hearted , ... .. to preach deliverance to the captives , ... .. to give sight to the blind .
to set at iiberty them that are bruised .
to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord .
amen .
today ...
.. in your hearing ...
.. the scriptures ... .. are fulfiiled .
the scriptures are fulfiiled .
did he say fulfiiled?
but ... how can he dare to say such a thing?
what do you mean?
the prophecy you have read can only be fulfiiled by the coming of the messiah .
yes !
by the coming of the kingdom of god .
the kingdom of god comes not in a way foreseen by men .
repent ... and believe the good news .
the kingdom of heaven , ... .. behold , ... .. is suddenly upon you .
what? !
this man is mad .
blasphemer !
blessed is he who is not ashamed of me !
take this man out !
don't iet him touch the scriptures !
clear him out !
today , ... .. in our hearing , ... .. the scriptures ... are fulfiiled .
go away !
go away !
never come back to nazareth !
don't iet him go !
blasphemer !
stone him !
put him to death !
stone him to death !
blasphemer !
that's what he deserves !
the law states clearly stone him !
don't iet him go !
master !
master !
master !
we were told to make ourselves known to you .
i am andrew of capernaum .
a fisherman by trade .
but your foilower now , if you'ii take me .
this is philip .
we were sent by john the prophet .
the baptist .
he has just been imprisoned by king herod antipas .
andrew .
philip .
come with me .
come on !
teii me , when was john arrested?
as soon as he returned to galiiee .
he had to return .
so many people were waiting for him ...
there it is : the sea of galiiee , and capernaum , where i was born .
it's a town of fishermen , but it also has the greatest synagogue in israel .
you can stay at my brother's house .
he's a good man .
simon peter .
the commandments god gave to moses so iong ago ... .. must not remain dead stone for the reverence of unthinking minds .
dead stone?
the tablets of the law?
dead stone? !
what do you mean?
stone is what the law is written on .
but the law itself is alive .
and iiving things are constantly changing .
but our law is eternal .
you cannot change the law of moses !
that's right , the law is here .
a man is made of flesh and blood , and he changes .
doesn't he remain the same man?
god wants to write the law on your hearts .
rabbi , you said you have come here to give us the good news .
is this it?
the good news?
that the law is iiving iike a man?
your captivity is over .
what does that mean , our captivity is over?
what captivity?
captivity in sin .
god fulfils the promise he made to our people israel ... .. and reconciles himself to man .
god is coming to you .
to aii of you .
even the most wretched .
do not shut the door in his face .
aaargh ... !
the devil's in him !
he's possessed by the devil !
listen to me !
not to him !
aaargh !
hold him down !
he's possessed !
rabbi , the demon has tried to throw him into fire and into water to destroy him !
if you can do anything , have mercy !
help my poor faith .
hold him !
watch out !
aaargh !
watch out !
satan !
aaargh !
satan !
leave ... him !
the spirit has gone .
father ...
oh , my son !
my son !
oh !
praised be the lord .
it's aii right !
he's aii right !
yes , we're aii fishermen in our family .
andrew here knows us weil .
but i was sent off to iearn .
aii you were fit for , perhaps !
and what have you iearnt?
oh , that two and two make four , sometimes , ... .. that most people seem to be here to be pushed about , ... .. that getting on is a fine thing , ... .. that birth is the beginning of death .
but there must be something more for man between birth and death .
today , when i heard you preaching , i began to understand .
it gave me hope .
through your words , the old scriptures seem to become alive .
that's what we want .
we want the law to be alive , ... .. written in our hearts , not carved in stone .
what is your name?
john .
son of zebedee .
john .
stay with us .
back !
back !
keep back , you idiot !
why don't you iet us in !
there's my brother now .
simon peter .
and there's my brother james .
he's shouting again .
angry as usual .
if anyone's drunk , it's you , you sponge !
he doesn't mean it .
he's a good man .
what's the matter?
poor catch?
poor catch?
nothing !
the only things we catch these days are roman taxes , ... .. and while we're out sweating , working our hands raw on the nets , ... .. the stinking tax gatherers take half and give it to the romans !
bloodsuckers !
go , brother .
go and teii that ieech , that two faced tax coilector of ours , matthew , ... .. that if he wants more money out of me , to put some fish in the iake .
simon , this is the man i told you about .
the man john spoke of . john the baptist .
what?
another holy man?
are you another of those that teii us to be patient , ... .. and promise us better times wiii be ahead?
what about now?
what about our children?
who wiii fiii their beilies?
a iot of talk these days , while we aii starve .
find a holy man who can put an end to that , then maybe i'ii iisten .
go out again .
i shaii come with you .
we've just puiled in !
get the nets off the boat .
please , simon , do as he says .
why do you iisten to these people?
he's different , simon .

please !
what are you staring at?

you can preach to the fish .
cast off .
we're going out again .
i knew he'd do it .
come on , john .
he sends us out again , and we catch aii these fish !
it's a miracle !
it's not a miracle .
only god can work miracles .
they speak these profanities .
they believe him .
we must go and speak to him .
i've never seen anything iike that .
my house wiii not hold any more people !
please !
my father is iil !
i want the master to cure him !
stop !
that's enough !
help me up !
i can't get up !
i want to see him !
there are too many already !
keep back !
keep back !
touch me , master !
touch me !
i can see weii from here .
master !
it was amazing .
i've been fishing for four years and i've never seen a catch so big .
more .
so !
there were miracles , were there?
and a big catch , inspired by a prophet .
what's his name? jesus?
get out .
he's staying with simon peter , the fisherman .
oh , i know him , yes .
he owes me back taxes , doesn't he?
move !
weil , weil , weil .
weil , if there's been a big catch , he can pay , can't he?
the kingdom of heaven is iike a treasure hidden in a field .
a man finds it , and in his joy spends everything he has to buy that field .
it's iike a merchant in search of fine pearls .
he finds one peari of great value , and seils everything to have that pearl .
you , you're aii fishermen .
weil , the kingdom of heaven is iike a net , a great net thrown into the sea .
suddenly it is fiiled .
it's almost bursting .
you have to caii to the other boats to come and help .
everybody's working together , happy , excited .
it's a time for joy .
for rejoicing in what god has freely given you .
the tax coilector .
peter , your friend matthew is here .
get out !
you're defiling this house !
bloodsucking tax coilector !
no place for you here !
we don't want you .
out of my house !
you scum !
filth !
no , simon , don't .
i wiii not have it defiled by you !
i hear you've had a big catch , simon .
we'ii talk about it iater , shaii we?
but what about this friend of yours?
this new preacher or teacher or whatever he is .
am i not ailowed to speak with him?
not ... in my house .
you seem to be unwelcome here .
i don't know your name , but i know what you do .
levi ... or matthew .
i am known by both names .
and by others .
you and i must meet in a place where both of us are welcome .
is your house far?
why do you ask?
i should iike to have supper with you tonight .
you would enter the house of a sinner?
i would enter any house where i am welcome .
he doesn't seem to realise the scandai it would cause .
peter , you teii him .
i've told him .
teii him again .
they're aii talking about it .
meaning some pharisees , i suppose .
weil , they know the law .
tax coilectors cannot enter a synagogue .
whoever associates with them is defiled .
according to the pharisees .
that's their argument .
peter , teii him .
i've told him !
what do you want from me?
why don't you join us as weil?
andrew .
andrew , i am not iike you .
i am not a foilower of priests and prophets .
i am a fisherman .
i have my family to think of .
you foilowed the baptist .
now foilow this one .
peter ! just ieave me alone !
why did you bring him here to me?
this is my iife !
my nets ...
my boats .

foilow him !
but ieave me !
come on .
you can't talk to him when he's iike this .
come on , philip .
this is where i belong .
master !
it's a scandai for you to eat with these people .
we've iived our iives honourably , made sacrifices .
they are thieves , whores , usurers .
violent and godless people .
now you eat with such people , who spend their iives in orgies and perversions .
i am not come to caii the virtuous to repentance , but the sinners .
they might enter heaven before you .
listen , master , if you eat with these people , they wiii contaminate you .
the town wiii abandon you .
james is right . james , ... .. the heart of the law is mercy .
you can't go .
come , my iovely .

and a few days iater this younger son set off for a distant iand ... .. and there he squandered aii the money he had on riotous iiving .
now , not iong after this a great famine swept over the iand ... .. and the boy began to starve .
he persuaded a farmer to hire him to feed his pigs , ... .. but he was so hungry , even the husks he fed the swine began to iook good to him .
and stiii nobody gave him anything .
finaily , the boy came to his senses .
at home ... .. even my father's servants have enough food , and to spare .
and here i am starving to death .
i wiii go home ... .. and ask my father to hire me as one of his servants .
and so ... he set off .
now he was stiii some distance from his home ... .. when his father saw him coming , ... .. and he was so fiiled with compassion ... .. that he ran towards his son ... .. and embraced him and kissed him .
the boy said " father , i have sinned against heaven and you .
i am not worthy to be cailed your son .
but his father cailed for the servants ... .. and said " bring me the finest robe in the house and put it on him .
put rings on his hands and shoes on his feet .
kiii the fatted calf .
we must celebrate with a feast .
my son was dead ... .. and is alive again .
now , ... .. the older brother at this time was working in the fields , ... .. and as he came back to the house ... .. he heard the noise of music and dancing .
he cailed for one of the servants and asked what was happening .
and he was told .
at this , the older brother became very angry ... .. and he refused to go into the house .
the father came out and tried to plead with him , but he wouldn't iisten .
i have worked for you aii this time , aii these years , ... .. and never once have i disobeyed you .
in aii that time you've never even given me a goat ... .. so that i can have a feast with my friends .
my younger brother comes back , having spent aii your money on harlots , ... .. and for him you kiii the fatted calf .
please , " said the father , ...
.. " please , ... .. try to understand .
you are always with me .

i have come to sow discord between a man and his father , ... .. between a daughter and her mother .
a man's enemies ... .. wiii be members of his own family .
you may say we have ieft our belongings to become your foilowers .

whoever wants to save his iife wiii iose it , ... .. but if a man wiii iose his iife for my sake and for the gospei i bring you , ... .. he wiii save it .
for many that are first wiii be iast .
and the iast first .
so do not store up for yourselves treasure on earth , ... .. where it grows rusty and moth eaten and thieves break in to steai it .
store up treasure in heaven , ... .. for where your treasure is there wiii your heart be also .

a man wiii always forgive a man , but a woman's sin ...
that's another story .
for most people , but not for him .
i've never seen anybody iike him .

i sleep in the day , don't i? !
sorry , i forgot .
weil , there are big crowds foilowing him everywhere , ... .. sometimes so big he has to sleep in a field .
he thinks nothing of eating and drinking with thieves and whores .
any scum of the earth is good enough for him .
one of his disciples , as they caii themselves , was a tax coilector , ... .. the thieving swine .
but this jesus ...
weil , he says it's not the righteous that need him , it's the sinners .

we should send these people away .
we've got nothing to give them to eat .
they should go to the viilages where they can find food .
there's no need to send them away .
you give them something to eat .
how?
there are thousands of them .
we cannot feed them .
is there any food ieft?
this is aii we have .
five barley ioaves and two fish .
put the ioaves and the fish in the baskets ... .. and give them to the people .

there's plenty !
we've reaily got some food !
how wonderful !
a miracle !
a miracle ! jesus of nazareth has performed a miracle !
master ... may i speak with you?
what is your name , my son?
my name is judas iscariot .
caii me a scholar the state finds useful .
i read and write hebrew , greek , latin .
i ...
i translate documents .
this has become a country of many tongues .
now i have never beaten copper , ... .. nor carved wood , nor ... .. caught fish as your men have , but ... .. i know your men .
my father is a prosperous builder .
he said my son must never have cailuses on his hands , nor brick dust in his hair .
my money must make my son into a scholar .
behold a scholar , ... .. who wishes to serve you .
but do you need ... a man iike me?
the tree is known by its fruit .
come .
stay with us .
blessed are the poor in spirit , ... .. for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
blessed are those who mourn , ... .. for they shaii be comforted .
blessed are the meek , ... .. for they shaii inherit the earth .
blessed are those who hunger and thirst for what is right , ... .. for they shaii be fiiled .
blessed are the merciful , ... .. for they shaii obtain mercy .
blessed are the pure in heart , ... .. for they shaii see god .
blessed are the peacemakers , ... .. for they shaii be cailed sons of god .
blessed are those who are persecuted in the cause of right , ... .. for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
blessed are you ... .. when people abuse you and persecute you ... .. and speak aii kinds of calumny against you for my sake .
rejoice !
and be glad !
for your reward wiii be great in heaven , ... .. as it was for the prophets persecuted before you .
in your prayers , ... .. remember your father knows what your needs are before you ask him .
this is how you should pray .
our father , ... .. who art in heaven , ... .. hailowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come .
thy wiii be done on earth , as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread .
and forgive us our debts , ... .. as we forgive our debtors .
and iead us not into temptation , ...
.. but deliver us ... .. from evil .
heai the sick , cleanse the iepers , cast out devils .
take nothing with you except a staff .
no pack , no food , no money .
whenever you come to a town or viilage , find who is worthy in it and stay with him .
and if at any place they wiii not receive you or iisten to you , ... .. shake the dust off your feet as you ieave .
sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment wiii fare better than that place .
i am sending you out as sheep amongst wolves .
be as wise as serpents .
and as harmless as doves .
don't be anxious about what you are to say , ... .. how you are to speak .
it is not you who speak , ... .. but the spirit of your father speaking through you .
freely you have received .
now freely give .
go .
god be with you , simon peter .
john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , ... .. and you said he was possessed by devils .
here i am , drinking and eating freely with you .
no doubt you'ii say i am a glutton and a drinker .
friend of tax coilectors and sinners .
oh , rabbi , ... .. you do us an injustice .
we respect your achievements , and we understand their importance .
but to what extent are you prepared to accept our laws?
we hear that you heai the sick on the sabbath .
do you want our people not to rest on the sabbath?
if your sheep feii into a pit on the sabbath day , ... .. wouldn't you get it out?
god made the sabbath for man , not man for the sabbath .
we understand that !
we understand what you're trying to say !
but is it not confusing to other people?
we iive by the law .
if we accept the law to be ruled by exceptions , ... .. then we are iost .
today , if it hadn't been for the severity that we iearned from moses , ... .. we would not have our laws .
we would not even be a people any ionger .
but it is the ... the excessive tolerance , the iack of rigidity in your teaching , ... .. that has made us feei that this is a reai danger .
the law gives me security .
it's a guide to my whole way of iife .
a measure for judging this man is right , this man is wrong .
you should not judge .
but you , as a son of israel , ... .. know that we were chosen by god from aii mankind ... .. to be the holy nation .
and , for this , he gave us our law , the torah , ... .. which is the law of iife .
and we have to separate ourselves from the sinners and be pure and just .
but who is just in the eyes of the lord?
what is the heart of the law?
hear , o israel , thou shalt love the lord thy god ... .. with aii thy heart , with aii thy soul , with aii thy strength .
this is the greatest commandment .
you said weil .
you are not far from the kingdom of god , joseph of arimathea .
but there is another commandment no iess great .
you must love your neighbour as yourself .
but who is my neighbour?
no !
stop her !
you can't come in !
this is no place for the iikes of you !
what's the matter?
isn't she that woman?
that whore?
yes , it's her .
she's defiling him .
this is no place for you , woman .
come .
leave quickly .
simon , sit down .
but , rabbi , you know what kind of a woman this is .
simon , please .
simon .
when i came into your house , you didn't pour water over my feet , ... .. or kiss me in greeting , or anoint my head with oil .
she has washed my feet with her tears .
and dried them with her hair .
and anointed them .
daughter , ... .. your sins , ... .. and i know they are many , ... .. are forgiven you because of the greatness of your iove .
only god can forgive sins no man .
your faith has saved you .
go ... .. and sin no more .
daughter .
take this ointment .
and keep it for my burial .
go in peace .
.. begged me to touch him and he could walk !
a ieper said my shadow had crossed her and she was cured !
they cailed out to me , " rabbi !
rabbi !
i didn't know how to preach , either , then suddenly i found myself speaking .
the same power peter was given .
master , there is great excitement everywhere about you .
who do the people in galiiee say that i am?
some say john the baptist .
they wiii not believe he is dead .
they know he is dead , many indeed , ... .. but they say you're john the baptist alive again .
and who do you say that i am?
i say you are ... .. the messiah .
the son ... of the iiving god .
in saying that , simon bar jonah , ... .. you show yourself to be blessed among men .
flesh and blood have not revealed this truth to you .
it has come from my father in heaven .
so now i wiii caii you peter , ... .. the rock .
and upon this rock i wiii build what i must caii my church .
the gates of heii wiii not prevaii against it .
to you i give the keys ... .. of the kingdom of heaven .
and to you aii i say this .
peter has spoken the truth .
and now you know it .
but you must not reveai it to any man .
the time has not yet come .
but another time is coming .
the time for me to go to jerusalem .
oh , yes , master .
you must go to jerusalem .
the whole city awaits you .
the elders of israei must know and recognise you .
no , judas .
in jerusalem the son of man wiii be rejected by the elders ... .. and the chief priests of the temple .
he wiii be condemned .
he wiii be handed over to the unbelievers , ... .. who wiii scourge him , ... .. mock him , ... .. put him to death .
then , ... .. after three days , ...
.. he wiii rise again .
