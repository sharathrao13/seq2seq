do any of you actually know anything about breakin 'in?
scip's gonna be no help .
you know that , right?
who cares about scipio?
we'll do it without him .
look , once we got the 50, 000 , we won't need anyone no grown ups and no phony thief lord .
we'll do it tonight .
the sooner the better .
what do you think?
are you in?
i suppose so .
good .
what about you , prop?
prop , are you in or not?
no way .
i could open that door with my eyes closed .
what if they're still awake?
what do we do then?
jeepers , bo !
i almost had a heart attack .
you forgot something really important .
what?
it's under my jumper .
what?
me !
bo .
mosca?
hornet?
riccio?
where's bo?
shh .
bring him back here right now .
calm down .
he snuck out and threatened to wake up the whole square if we didn't help him over the wall .
here .
catch .
i should've left you with esther .
you want to go to an orphanage or a boot camp for babies?
shh !
i'm stay  see what i mean?
don't do that again , okay?
i almost peed my pants .
what are you doing here?
get lost .
what are you doing here?
this is my job .
oh , shut up , you lying piece of crap .
this might just be one big jolly for a rich boy like you , but we need the money .
stop it .
have you forgotten where we are?
and you can't take anything to the conte , you fibbing , lying rat lord .
not even a message , 'cause we've got sofia .
so there !
come on , you lot .
we've got to find the wing .
prosper , me and you take the left .
riccio and hornet , you go right .
yeah , and you , pants on fire , just stay out of our way .
you better go home , scipio .
the others are really angry .
they don't understand what you've done .
are you angry?
do you understand?
i'm trying .
what is this?
wow .
look .
what's the matter?
the pictures .
whoa .
the wing's not in the living room .
what's up?
scip's just gone upstairs .
what?
prop .
oh , my god .
upstairs?
oh , no !
everybody just calm down for a minute .
so , for once i decide to go out at night , and what do i find when i get back?
a bunch of little cat burglars creeping around in my house .
please don't shoot .
oh .
so look who it is .
it's the rude little boy from the kiosk ... and the little girl oh , and the poor orphan boy .
what are you after , my cameras?
please , don't call the police .
oh , i think that'll be the very least i will do .
you have a right to be angry , but we're not after your cameras .
we only want the wing .
the wing?
really?
what do you know about my wing?
oh !
and how old are you?
six and a quarter .
madonna .
he's my little brother .
he doesn't know better .
why have you got pictures of him?
why have you got pictures of him?
i'm a photographer .
i i take pictures of kids on the street .
that's why .
where do you live?
we haven't got proper homes .
well , i'm sorry to hear that , if it's true .
now , what do you want with my wing?
someone asked us to steal it .
asked you?
who?
my client wishes to maintain the upmost confidentiality .
scipio , put the gun down .
i found the wing .
it was in her room .
come on .
let's get out of here .
oh , just give it to me !
it doesn't work anyway .
and that , i presume , is my wing?
you know , i'm i'm curious .
just how much does this mystery employer offer to pay you for it?
50, 000 .
50, 000?
that's rather a lot .
not for us , 'cause we have to pay for everything ...
'cause we don't have parents or anything , and we have to leave the star lair ... and mosca's boat needs painting , and riccio needs new teeth ... and hornet needs new clothes , and i'm worried it's not enough actually .
it's beautiful .
it's an angel's wing , isn't it?
an angel's?
oh , no .
it's a lion's wing .
i told you so , but no one listens to me .
i was given it , when i left the orphanage .
are you an orphan?
yes .
i lived there for more than 10 years .
what makes the wing worth so much?
what makes the wing worth so much?
do you know i really don't know?
but i think it's time we found out .
mother superior sent me here ... because i tried to find out the truth .
over 150 years ago ... a rich merchant gave the merry go round to the orphanage .
but before the children could ever enjoy it ... it disappeared .
all they ever found was a fragment .
the wing !
i found it
in the attic of the orphanage ... and i gave it to ida ... to keep safe .
i never saw the merry go round ... but it was said to be
unique .
it had five wooden figures on it .
yes , i know the mermaid ... the " man maid " with the big fork ... the sea horse from the fountain ... the flying lion and the uni um whatsit .
the unicorn?
yes , like that one .
bo , how do you know all this?
mum told me .
sister , what makes the merry go round so special?
it had magical powers .
what did it do?
a child could go round and round and round .
it became a grown up .
a grown up could go round and round and round
and become a child .
sister , please tell me , is that really true?
of course .
my great great grandmother saw it .
the conte must know where the merry go round is now .
it doesn't make sense otherwise .
you know , i bet he believes that if he reattaches the wing , it really will work .
work , like the sister said?
if it really works , i swear i'll find it .
i'll find it , ride on it , and i'll only get off when i'm taller than my father .
i tell you what .
i'll let you have the wing .
you take it to the conte , and you get your reward ... but i want to go with you .
we follow the conte , and he will lead us to the merry go round .
we'll do what ida says .
who asked you?
go home , thief lord , back to that posh house you live in .
hey !
fighting isn't what we need right now .
i'm as cross with him as you are , but this time he's right .
i know it's true , 'cause i've seen all the animals now .
i'm afraid it's just a fairy tale , bo .
no , it's not .
i promise .
wouldn't it be good if it was true?
think what we could do .
this is your big moment , sofia , so don't screw up .
the boys are definitely no longer in venice .
i am convinced of it .
i'm total utterly convinced the boys are no longer in venice .
but where have they gone?
corfu .
corf corfu?
but that's impossible .
why on earth would they go to corfu?
well , they probably knew that i was onto them .
oh , no , no , no , no .
i'm quite sure that they are still here .
now , i have had posters printed ... with boniface's photo on them , which you
something you could've done , had you shown any initiative .
if you continue to display such incompetence ...
i'll have no choice but to take matters into my own hands .
get your grubby hands off !
that's a valuable piece !
here .
have a little sweetie .
keep you still .
now , you can trust your friend , ernesto barbarossa ... with a little secret .
what did your master steal for the conte?
we may be young , but we're not completely stupid .
give that back before i tear your nasty little tongue out !
you
you can keep it , because you shouted at prosper .
anyway , it was yucky .
meet me on the sacca della misericordia .
look out for a red lantern .
tonight , 1 : 00 a . m .
tonight?
well , how are you planning to get across the lagoon in that tub , anyway?
who said anything about the lagoon?
well , you don't think the conte could keep the merry go round secret in the city , do you?
and another thing .
he's not gonna be too happy ... to find the rightful owner of the wing in on the deal .
scipio'd better steer .
he knows all about boat trips .
all right .
i'll make myself invisible for a while .
soon , my beloved sister .
soon , our years of patience will earn their reward .
time our foolish young delivery boy kept his appointment .
salve , thief lord .
i presume you re just as cold as we are ... so let's complete this transaction as quickly as possible .
well , what on earth is that?
here .
if i were you , i would use the money to find myself another occupation .
how old are you , 14?
15?
with this money , i can be any age i want .
i won't have to be a child any longer .
did you hear that , renzo?
he no longer wants to be a child !
nature will soon grant him his wish .
don't you want to count the money , thief lord?
holy moly !
uh , how much does it cost to go to the dentist?
looks like it's all here .
i believe you to be a man of your word .
safe return , thief lord .
thief lord , hedgehog boy ... money boy , boat boy .
i wonder where my walking , talking little reward is?
turn on the lights !
there they are , the little pests !
it's the police !
where's prop?
get them !
get them !
hurry , quick !
they're not back yet !
come on .
stop running !
stop running !
we're not gonna harm you !
come on , bo .
through here .
stop !
can't get away , kids !
stop !
go on !
run !
come here !
come here !
watch out !
no !
well , well , well .
look who it is .
did you really think you were going to get away?
running never helps .
ka ching !
how far's the conte gonna sail?
if we go on like this , we'll be as stiff as frozen chickens .
oh , my god .
i know where this is .
don't go any further .
turn off the engine .
isola segreta .
the secret isle .
i thought it was deserted , but it seems i'm wrong .
isola segreta?
isn't that the island where nobody goes?
they say it's haunted .
and that anyone who sets foot on the island never returns .
i've had it .
let's go .
i'm not going near no haunted island .
deal off .
time to get our money home .
wait .
look .
they're looking this way .
renzo !
can you see anything?
there's nothing there !
they're just nervous !
they know what we're doing !
oh , my god .
i think the woman's got a gun !
go away !
heads down !
get away from here !
don't you know this is private property?
keep your heads down !
don't come back !
is everyone all right?
i am so sorry i dragged you into this madness .
well , at least we've got the money .
it's there , prop .
it has to be on that island .
what have the police been doing here?
how should i know?
shut up .
come on .
bo !
hornet !
where are you?
i knew it !
why didn't you listen to me?
it's the snooper !
he's conned us !
stupid word of honor !
i could puke !
hold on , slugger !
calm down !
put that away , okay?
i'll go ask him .
see if he'd rather tell us or have his face smashed in !
ah , gentlemen , the matter seems to have resolved itself .
my son has decided to come home after all .
do you know this boy?
all right .
just let me go .
i can walk by myself .
bo is with his aunt .
if i find you had something to do with this incident at the stella ...
i swear to god , you will regret the day you were born .
where's my brother?
and where's hornet?
go on .
tell him .
somebody kindly tell me what all this rumpus is about .
bo and hornet have disappeared , and prosper thinks that you ratted on us .
so does riccio !
what a load of cobblers .
number one , i haven't ratted on anyone .
number two , i haven't been to the stella since i escaped .
and number three , i told the hartliebs that you'd left venice .
so , don't you think it's time to decide if i'm your friend ... or your enemy? ... in its rich history .
it is many times more magnificent
now , i think we'd better go inside before we become a tourist attraction .
ooh !
so , ida let you run through the city with this lot?
means you got some nerve , i must say .
hang on .
somebody's ripped you off .
this money's not real .
fake money?
i'm afraid so .
all of it .
what a waste !
the break in , the lagoon !
we nearly get shot , and what do we get?
a pile of funny money !
what about bo?
i'm sorry , proper .
i'll do everything i can to help get him back .
hello?
uh , good morning , mrs. hartlieb .
it's victor getz .
i just wanted to  how dare you call me at this hour?
your case has resolved itself .
we have captured our nephew , no thanks to you .
apparently he was hiding in some derelict cinema with some girl who wouldn't give a name .
the police are taking care of her .
now , will you kindly not disturb us again?
you look so smart in your new suit .
it's all right .
have a taste .
it's all for you .
i hate it , and i hate you .
what on earth do you think you're doing , you ungrateful little monkey?
morning .
we're here to see ida spavento .
oh .
don't i know you?
uh huh .
yes , you do .
we're staying this time .
vic victor , what on what on earth is going on?
i was gonna ask you the same thing .
and to make things even worse , the conte gave us fake money .
no .
these kids are in enough trouble as it is , ida .
you you really haven't helped .
shut up , victor !
well , i guess i'm the one in trouble now .
well , i'm sure we'll figure something out .
damn it , ida .
what were you thinking , taking these kids on one of your crazy adventures?
oh , and what would you have done?
lock them all up in an orphanage again?
talking of which , they probably took hornet to the merciful sisters .
does anyone know her real name?
katarina?
aha , so that is your name .
come with me .
you have visitors .
who is it?
your godmother .
there she is .
come here .
oh .
sweetheart .
come on , prop .
you can't wait out here all night .
bo's inside there .
i know it .
bo's not going anywhere tonight .
as long as he's in the hotel , he's safe .
anyway , hornet can't wait to see you .
do you know what?
i reckon she's got a crush on you .
wake up .
how did you know we were at ida's?
how quickly you forget how i can ghost through the city ... tracking whom i please .
they took bo away from you because you're not grown up like them .
there's only one thing for it , prop .
we have to go back to the island and both take the ride of a lifetime .
come on , dear .
what do you expect in this place?
what is there to say?
what did you think of the wine?
oh , don't .
warm white wine .
bo?
warm white wine .
i mean , warm white wine !
you'd think they'd know .
but what about the soggy spaghetti?
did you get cheese with that fish sauce?
no .
did you?
no .
no .
gone?
what do you mean , gone?
where's he gone?
out of the window?
i looked everywhere else .
oh , he went out of the window , did he?
oh , really?
how can he possibly have got out the window?
look , look .
down there?
look at the drop , you fool !
it wasn't me .
yes?
mr. getz?
is there a chance , mr. getz , that you will perform any useful service in our employ?
or are you too busy feeding your tortoises?
oh , uh , i beg your pardon .
i thought i'd been fired .
boniface has run away again , selfish little imp !
now , we expect him back here , with us , by the morning !
when did he run away?
is anyone looking for him?
your husband or the police?
oh !
give it here .
listen here , getz .
fortunately for you , my wife is a patient woman .
this case will be resolved immediately , if i have to do it myself .
is that clear enough for you?
see?
like i thought .
no dogs at the back .
what's the matter?
i'm scared .
of what?
they have guns .
bo?
bo !
it's me , victor .
i'm not going back to esther .
well , good .
because we're not planning to let her have you .
really?
yeah , not even the tiniest little piece of you .
where are you?
up here .
they're all gone .
and my kittens .
they're
they're all tucked up safe and sound at ida's house .
esther said prosper was bad .
no .
let me tell you one thing .
prosper is the best brother anyone could have .
come on .
i'll catch you .
i bet that big brother of yours is worried sick about you .
but at least he's in a nice , soft bed .
don't move .
if we run , they'll take us down .
bimba !
bella !
enough !
what are you doing here?
we want to see the conte .
the conte doesn't like unannounced visitors .
we had a deal with him , and he cheated us .
that way .
and don't try to run .
my dogs are faster than you .
bella .
renzo , the thief lord has come to pay you a visit .
something about fake money and a merry go round .
i think it would be a capital idea ... to feed him and his little friend to the dogs .
i apologize for my sister's rudeness .
so you found out about the money?
my apologies .
it was barbarossa's idea .
i wouldn't have been able to pay you otherwise .
i knew it .
the merry go round works .
you're the conte .
at your service , thief lord .
does anyone know you're here?
our friends know .
and a detective too .
we will settle everything to your full satisfaction .
we pay you with a ride on the merry go round .
that is what you are here for , is it not?
it is indeed .
just be aware that this is no simple fairground attraction .
to ride one of the creatures ... is to ride into the teeth of peril .
i only just managed to dismount in time .
uh , looks like you went a bit too far .
we were never allowed a real childhood ... in which to play and grow up together .
how could you possibly want to turn yourselves into children?
prosper and i want to ride the merry go round forward .
va bene .
if that is your wish .
i'll go and check on them .
are you expecting visitors?
no one dares to set foot on this island .
the only visitor we allowed to come here was barbarossa .
does he know about that merry go round?
good heavens , no .
he'd immediately start selling tickets at 10, 000 apiece .
can't wait to see prosper's face when he sees you safe and sound .
but what if he rode the merry go round and is now all old like you?
i don't know what funny stories you've been listening to .
wow !
look at it , prop .
it's incredible .
this is the solution to all our problems .
problems just don't disappear because you get older .
that's the point .
you'll be a man ... free to overcome them in any way you want .
does it matter which one we ride?
the lion was the right mount for me , but to grow older ... you two must choose one of the water creatures .
come on , prop .
take a pick .
which one do you want?
the sea horse or the merman?
what you do is your choice , but i can't do this .
what about bo?
think how happy he would be .
bo wants me as a brother , not a father .
you heard him , conte .
looks like i'm riding solo .
so let's do it .
come on .
let's go !
are you quite sure you want to go through with this?
i've never been more sure of anything in my life .
and i swear i won't come off till i need a shave .
hold on tight .
here we go !
roll on the good times !
whoo hoo !
yeah !
whoo hoo !
yeah !
make him get off or he'll be an old man !
scip !
get off !
jump off !
jump off !
jump off !
that ... was incredible .
don't look so shocked .
it worked .
look .
just look at me .
stubble .
unbelievable .
come on , prop .
what do you think?
am i bigger than my father?
it's this way .
believe me .
ow !
ow !
where are you taking me , you little squirt?
no , we're nearly there .
ow !
i knew you were stringing me along .
you just tried to get me away from the house , away away from this extraordinary contraption .
signor barbarossa .
what , for heaven's sake , are you doing with the contessa?
contessa?
yes , contessa .
i presume we are here for the same reason at this late hour .
namely , to experience the magic of this famous merry go round in operation .
famous?
magic?
wait a moment .
this is the legendary merry go round of the merciful sisters !
must be worth a fortune !
you may look older , but has it made you wiser , thief lord?
why don't you try it yourself?
of course .
why not?
shake off some years .
get rid of those aches and pains .
sharpen the mind perhaps?
you do know how to work it?
i do indeed .
come on , you two .
signor barbarossa wishes to take a ride .
which , um , animal should i mount?
i would suggest the lion .
excellent !
i'm ready for my little test drive .
you heard signor barbarossa .
let's give him the ride he deserves .
not too hard .
just a few turns at first .
who wouldn't want to shed a few years , eh?
good bye , wrinkles .
good bye , saggy tummy .
good bye , big , fat , wobbly bottom .
hey !
no !
no !
not so hard !
i'm gonna be sick !
no !
my merry go round !
it's ruined !
after all the trouble we went to !
no .
morosina , what have we done?
that fat pig !
my god !
that was the ride from hell !
you dolt !
you great , fat , scheming hippopotamus !
you've just destroyed what i've spent half my life working on !
it wouldn't stop !
look at what's happened to me !
i'm a respected man !
can i at least recommend a better tailor?
oh , victor , you found him !
oh , thank goodness .
we were looking for him all night .
is he okay?
yeah , yeah .
he's fine .
he's just a bit tired .
where have you been?
at the merry go round with scip .
didn't work , did it?
yeah , it did .
scip's all grown up .
really?
but you're still my same prop .
are you disappointed?
no .
i'm happy .
bottoms up to bella donna and big nose here !
big nose?
excuse me?
who is this impertinent midget?
midget?
i am ernesto barbarossa .
i am a successful and honest businessman ... and enjoy the respect of this fair city .
and who might you be?
oh , my god .
it's true .
it works .
stop it .
you've had enough .
what are you , my father?
you'll do as you're told , or it'll be straight to bed with no story .
sorry i had to bring him here , ida .
he's afraid of the dark .
he didn't want to stay in the shop on his own .
shop?
excuse me .
sorry .
i don't understand .
and you?
i've heard of growth spurts , but this is ridiculous .
i mean , what are you?
your own older brother?
or the winner of a thief lord look alike competition or what?
how about your new assistant?
can someone please explain what's going on here ... before i start drinking port for breakfast as well?
look .
it's only me .
just a bit taller and older .
bo !
where did victor find you?
in the stella .
ah .
of all the places we never thought to look .
the stella .
and now you're back .
that's the most important thing .
so is prop .
he went to the merry go round , and it works like i always said .
it really worked?
no way .
so , this is the little gang of criminals .
the sooner we put you all behind bars , the better .
oh , there he is , the little runaway .
he's staying with me .
mmm .
as you keep telling us .
get out of the way .
no !
give me my son !
he's not your son , you skanky old bat !
how dare you speak to my wife like that , you little monster?
get off !
get off me !
leave him alone , you big bully !
grab his ear !
oh !
enough !
now ... just hand over your brother , and we'll forget this ever happened .
it doesn't work , snot nose .
oh , really?
would you like to find out?
now look what you done , you stupid child !
leave him alone !
he's six years old , and he's got more sense than the pair of you put together !
it was an accident !
he he said it didn't work !
i suggest you put the gun down .
leave .
leave here .
leave venice , and leave these boys alone .
you're not fit to look after a tortoise , never mind a child .
now get out , before i call the police .
wow .
that certainly told them .
see what i mean about being a grown up?
how am i supposed to sleep with all this noise?
does anybody have an aspirin?
only speak when you're spoken to .
they better be rich , and i mean filthy rich .
now do try to keep a straight face , ida .
good afternoon .
monsignor and i ... are the principals of the orphanage ... of the merciful sisters .
how can we help you?
we understand you're looking for child to adopt .
we have conducted some research , and we have concluded that you are of impeccable character .
oh , thank you .
forgive our presumptuousness , but we saw an opportunity ... for little ernesto ... to find the happiness of a loving home .
what an adorable little fellow you
oh , what do you say , ernesto?
scusi?
oh .
whoo hoo !
man , it's even more than the fake stuff .
can you count up 50, 000?
what am i , einstein?
and we return the fake money to barbarossa .
sixty .
eighty .
maybe a little bonus .
the deal was 50 grand .
okay , 50 grand .
interest .
tax .
expenses .
has everybody got their share now?
uh , everybody except you .
i'll use it to buy you this boat ... and then put the rest of it in bank accounts for each of you .
bank accounts?
what next?
my midlife crisis?
i want to buy this boat .
how much do you want for it?
7, 000 .
is it seaworthy?
certainly .
it's just been refitted .
it looks as seaworthy as a rubber duck .
i'll give you five .
six .
five , five .
done .
let me get the deed .
now , don't go tearing around canal grande at night in this thing .
uh , and what would give us that idea?
i expect you to behave .
hey , that's a laugh coming from you , thief lord .
taxi .
taxi !
taxi !
taxi !
here .
taxi !
over here .
taxi .
taxi .
taxi .
taxi .
tax
check out our boat .
just test driving the new water wheels .
i'm gonna go look for my dad .
hey , boss .
i'll see you tomorrow in the office .
come on , mosca .
let's go !
victor?
yeah?
what's bo and i supposed to do now?
what do you mean?
what about me?
i know what i wanna do .
stay with ida .
well , he's right , of course .
you can't leave me now .
i just rattle around in that big old house .
victor , say something .
tell them they can't leave .
okay , you heard her .
you have to stay .
i think we'd make quite a family .
what?
victor , victor !
say yes !
say yes !
whoa !
whoa !
