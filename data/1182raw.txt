im good .
oh , my peewee .
always moving so fast .
you move in together after a month ...
live together for nine months , and now youre engaged .
oh , i know you love him , but you know ... sometimes it takes more than love ... to sustain a marriage .
you need to be old enough to know whoyou are ... and whatyou want and who he is .
oh , mom , mom , hes wild and spontaneous ... and hysterical and offbeat ... and on top of all that ... hes centered , and hes down to earth .
hes everything i want ... and we have this passion for each other ... thats just ... oh !
im jealous .
all right .
first thing tomorrow ... were gonna plan this wedding !
hey , you .
so i guess everyone thinks that were crazy ... for doing this .
now , when did we start caring about what other people think?
well , areyou sure that ... you dont want to marry a guy like peter?
if i wanted to know exactly what my life would be ... from here on out ...
i would marry a guy like peter .
but i love not knowing .
i love our messy loft .
your beater car .
ha ha .
i want to start a life with you .
sarah?
go .
hi , daddy .
peewee ... marriage is like a business investment .
its its long term viability ... is best established unemotionally .
bottom line , daddy?
we love each other .
that is all that matters , tsk .
leezak .
good night , sir .
congratulations , mr. leezak .
big daddy , leezaks in the house !
oh , i hope she doesnt spook on you , man .
what do you mean?
i love sarah .
dont get me wrong , but ... rich chicks spook .
a powerful daddy plus family money ... equals expectations .
expectations are like a fungal rot on a marriage .
my marriage is not gonna have a fungal rot .
were gonna be happily married every day ... for the rest of our lives .
unless she finds out that you slaughtered her dog .
oh , dont worry .
iil take that to my grave .
okay .
ifyou change your mind at the altar ... just pass out .
im not going to change my mind .
okay .
im just saying if you do ... just hit the floor .
thank you , but its not gonna happen .
so , youre sure youre ready ... to give up your grazing rights?
im not a grazer , kyle .
well , what if you became one later in life?
i mean , over the next 10 years ... youre giving up five hayrides peryear .
so i can either be happily married to sarah ... or have 50 one night stands .
minimum .
thats not even a choice .
okay , okay .
lets move on .
are there any chicks you didnt have ... thatyou wish you had?
you are , like , the worst best man ever .
hey ,, peter !

i dont think anything happened .
youre getting married ... and she didnt share the roster?
she shared the roster .
merrick and bruce .
what about prentiss?
and you never asked again?
i won .
its irrelevant .
okay .
as long as youre okay with a bogus roster .
its not a bogus roster .

hes
shut up .

no reason .
does kyle know something that i should know?
no .
you covered your nose .
i had an itch .

im ... and ... he started pulling on my ankle again .
so , i grabbed the ball ... and i was like , " go get it , buddy , .
and i threw the ball over my, shoulder ... and it went out the window ... and bags dove , and he died .
you killed bags?
it was an accident .
and you lied about it all this time?
