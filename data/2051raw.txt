what's wrong?
nothing .
alan !
this factory isn't a playground .
it's dangerous .
can i have a ride home?
is billy jessup after you?
son , you're gonna have to face him sooner or iater .
if you're afraid of something , you've got to stand and face it .
you should know better than to let the boy play in here .
what was it you wanted to show me?
just a minute , sir .
what the devii . .?
who did this?
weil?
i did , sir .
you've been hanging around with my girlfriend .
we're just friends .
not any more .
get him .
jerks !
neat .
alan?
are you home?
alan , not again .
come on .
hard work and determination have forged the brantford spirit
since our forefathers first settled this town .
despite the harshness of our climate and granite of our soil , we have ...
prospered .
i knew it ail this morning .
let's go .
sam , we have to talk to alan .
well , we're on our way .
i told your father what you told me , that it wasn't just biily jessup .
if i'd known that ...
it's okay , dad .
i'm proud of you .
you faced them even though you were outnumbered .
you took it iike a man , therefore we have decided
that you're ready to go to the cliffside schooi for boys .
congratulations , sweetheart .
you don't want me iiving here?
it's always been the plan that you go to cliffside .
parrishes have been going to cliffside since the 1 700's .
look at this .
parrish hail .
that's the main dormitory .
this is great !
people hate me here because i'm a parrish .
wait till i'm iiving in a building named after me .
it was named after my father .
good .
why don't you live in it?
i did , and it made me into the man i am today .
maybe i don't want to be like you .
maybe i don't want to be a parrish .
you won't be .
not tiii you start acting like one .
i'm not ready for cliffside then .
we're taking you there on sunday !
and not another word about it !
i'm never talking to you again !
sam .. .
what?
nothing .
what are you doing here?
i brought your bike back .
you didn't have to .
i was going to get it myself .
i told biily to stop picking on you .
you wasted your breath .
i can't talk right now .
what was that?
you heard it , too?
of course i heard it .
come on , i found this reaily weird game in the factory .
jumanji .
for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind .
roll the dice to move your token .
doubles gets another turn . '
the first to reach the end wins .
you want to play?
i quit playing board games five years ago .
sarah !
it's got to be magnetized .
alan , iook .
'when they fly you'd better run .
these winged things are no fun . '
what was that?
i don't know .
put it away , alan .
oh , no .
the game thinks i rolled .
what do you mean " 'the game thinks '"?
in the jungle you must wait till the dice read five or eight .
in the jungle you must wait ...
what does that mean?
26 years later . ..
i'll make it a bed and breakfast .
it was pretty hard to pass up .
it's already fuii of furniture .
i'd forgotten how big this place is .
judy , peter , come look at this .
i'll put a reception area here .
a bar over here in the parlour .
that sounds lovely .
i'm sure you and your kids will be very happy here .
actually , they're my iate brother's .
he and his wife passed away .
is this something , or what?
it sure is .
what do you think , young man?
is it big enough for you?
peter hasn't spoken a word since it happened .
i'm so sorry .
how terribly awful .
it's okay .
we barely even knew our parents .
they were always away .
skiing in st. moritz .
gambling in monte carlo .
safaris in africa .
we didn't even know if they loved us .
as the sheik's yacht went down , they wrote us a goodbye letter .
it was found floating in a champagne bottle .
excuse me ...
devoted parents .
it was a car crash in canada .
wiii you send me the papers?
first thing tomorrow .
i need a iocksmith .
peter , pick up your toys , please .
take this suitcase up to the attic .
then we can aii have ice cream ... and bourbon .
what is it?
i'm going to a motel .
for heaven's sake ...
i don't see any guano .
he said it looked like that .
that's an african bat .
some kid saw some in the 60's , but we don't get bats iike that here .
but that's what he saw .
whatever it was , it's gone now .
bats aren't what i'd worry about in this house , anyway .
what would you worry about?
i wouldn't want to live in a house where someone was murdered .
little alan parrish .
i say his father did it .
there's 1 , 001 places he could've hid the body in this house .
especially if he chopped it up .
you kids don't want to be iate for your first day of school .
not a bat in sight .
hear that?
there's nothing to be afraid of in this house .
i can't believe i have to see your principal after your first day .
let's just try to relax and finish our dinner .
we know why you got the house cheap .
26 years ago alan parrish disappeared from this house .
his parents chopped him up and hid him in the walls .
okay , i'm tired of your iies .
you're grounded !
fine , there's nowhere to go in this stupid town , anyway .
just for your information , that wasn't a iie .
did you hear anything a iittle while ago?
do you miss mom and dad?
no .
liar .
stop that or they'li send you to a shrink .
and where are they gonna send you if you don't start talking?
i'm going to the permit office .
the schooi bus wili be here soon .
do you guys stili have your keys?
are you iistening to me?
what?
i'ii wait tiii the bus comes .
did your parents use to put you on the bus?
no .

i could drop you off .
don't worry about us .
the bus will be here any minute .
ckay , please be good today .
you do hear it .

sorry .
easy , girl .
do you know what happened to this factory?
it folded up , iike everything else in this town .
it's cold out .
how about some coffee?
why would they close parrish shoes?
when his kid ran away , sam set out to find him .
he used aii his money .
after a while he stopped coming to work .
he just quit caring .
i don't think anybody loved his boy more than sam did .
here , you're gonna freeze .

i see them now and then .
they're over on adams street .
cur parents are dead too .
they were in the middle east negotiating peace . ..

i wonder if mrs. niedermeyer is stili teaching sixth grade .
come on , he's not gonna help us .
he's afraid .

you're afraid .
it's okay to be afraid .
let's set it up in the iiving room .
you have no idea what you're getting yourself into .
we can handle it .
we don't need your help .
i don't think so .
monkeys , mosquitoes and iions are just the beginning .
i've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares .
things you can't even imagine .
things you can't even see .
there are things that hunt you in the night .
then something screams .
then you hear them eat .
and you hope to god that you're not dessert .
afraid?
you don't even know what afraid is .
you wiii not iast five minutes without me .
so . .. are you gonna help us?
i'ii watch . ..
.. . but i'm not afraid .
peter , that was very cool .
that's reverse psychology .
dad used to try it on me .
ready?
yeah .
alan , ready?
there is no ready .
i'ii try it again .
alan , it's not working .
no .. . it's not your turn .
peter roiled twice , because he got doubles .
now it's my turn .
no , iook .. .
two of the pieces are yours , right?
whose are the other pieces?
the elephant was mine .
we're playing the game i started in 1 969 .
i'm gonna have to play .
it's not my turn .
whose turn is it?
sarah whittle .
this is where she used to iive .
this place gives me the creeps .
we used to play on this porch .
i knew she wouldn't still live here .
she probably married biily jessup .
maybe she'li know where sarah is .
she'ii know .
she's a psychic .
good point .
i remember the porch being a iot bigger .
can you help us?
do you have an appointment?
no , we're trying to find someone .
madam serena is busy .
maybe you can help us .
what is it?
a giri used to iive here .
i've iived here aii my iife .
then you must know sarah whittle .
what do you want with sarah whittle?
sarah . .?
i don't go by that name anymore .
sarah whittle?
what do you want?
26 years ago , you played a game with a iittle boy down the street .
a game with drums .
how do you know that?
i was that iittle boy , sarah .
alan?
you kiiled her .
leave a message and the doctor will call you back .
dr. boorstein , it's sarah whittle .
please caii me .
i need to have my dosage checked .
that event we've been discussing , the one that didn't happen . ..
the little boy who didn't really disappear . ..
i'm sitting in his iiving room drinking iemonade .
he'ii caii me back .
while we're waiting ...
i've spent 2, 000 hours in therapy convincing myself that didn't exist .
what happened to you was so awful , i made up that whole thing .
it was awful .
it really was ... but it was real .
no , your father murdered you and chopped you up .
sarah !
come on !
my dad did that?
my father could barely hug me , iet alone cut me into iittle pieces .
26 years ago , we started playing a little game .
now , we're aii gonna sit down and we're gonna finish it .
and guess what .
it's your turn .
play the game , sarah .
ail right , give me the dice .
go home , you don't have to play .
god !
how could you do that?
it's the law of the jungle .
i used to visualize you as a radiant spirit .
go on , read it .
'they grow much faster than bamboo .
take care or they'll come for you . " '
oh , great !
god !
teii me this isn't happening .
it is .
stay away from the walls .
don't touch anything .
no quick movements .
wow , they're beautiful .
the purple ones are poisonous .
and definitely stay away from the big yeilow pods .

the game is not over yet .
it is for me .
you are not in the jungle anymore .
anybody up for iced tea?
i'm gonna make some tea .
please , iast time i played this game it ruined my life .
it ruined your life? " 'in the jungle you must wait till the dice read five or eight .
i was a iittle girl , alan .
you disappeared .
a bunch of bats surrounded me and chased me down the street .
i was afraid .
i'm sorry , alan .
no one believed me .
i was alone .
so was i , for 26 years .
me , too .
it's okay , sarah .
we're scared , too .
but if we finish the game , it'ii ali go away .
what if i get stuck in the game?
you won't .
i won't stop playing .
neither wiil i.
i won't , either .
come on , sarah .
please .
i knew this was gonna be a bad day .
come on , we're gonna be fine .
we just have to keep our heads .
we roll with the punches .
the hunter from the darkest wilds .. . .. . makes you feei just iike a child . " '
what is it?
van pelt .. .
you miserable coward !
come back and face me like a man .
not good enough , sonny jim .
coming , ready or not .
hey , you !
get your hands in the air !
i don't believe this !
even if alan gets out of this , it'll happen all over again .
when you suppress your anger , it creates negative energy .
things happen , iike ending up in the jungle , that was no accident .
whose turn is it?
it's my turn .
you might have told us about him .
it's just a roii of the dice .
is he the reason you didn't want to play?
you didn't want to play either?
mr. " we" ve got to finish it " .
what's the deai with this guy?
he" s a hunter .
right now , he's after me .
why?
i don't know .
you" d think it'd be a waste of his time .
maybe l" d iook good on his wall .
your turn .
talk it over with him .
are you crazy?
the man has a gun .
don't ever call me crazy !
this whole town thinks i'm crazy because of this board game .
maybe i should roll .
yeah .
no one ever came to my parties .
heilo , i'm roiling now .
i'm gonna roil .
here , just roil .
don't be fooled , it isn't thunder .
staying put would be a blunder .
do you hear that?
run !
it's a stampede !

why didn't you grab it , peter?
ignore him .
he's a libra .

i can't stop them .

you wouldn't believe me if i told you , carl .

i know a iot more than that .
you used to work at parrish shoes .
they used to call you " sole man " .
that's right .
i was in there . .. till old man parrish fired me .
and i had something that could've turned this whole town around .
your shoes .
