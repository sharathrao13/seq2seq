the navy ... wantedtohearmystory .
theysaidlowedit to the dead to tell them the truth .
i told them where tostick the truth .
i'm the last one who knows ... what killed the men aboard that submarine , who knows it was a suicide mission .
but i'll burn in hell before i tell the murderers who sent us there .
that's why we've comehere all the way from washington , sailor , to hearyour story , to make sure thatjustice is served .
you said that afteryour outburst , the x. o. , johansen , locked you up with your captain .
johansen did what he had to .
that's war .
some are sacrificed so that others can live .
you've gotta get us out ofhere !
let go !
but when thatdoorshut ,
iknewmylife , allourlives , hadjustbeensacrificed . johansen !
open this door !
open this door ! johansen !
forthe fiirst time , wesawthe enemy that waskilling us .
that thing ... was causing theslow , painful deaths .
and i prayed one ofthejapanese depth charges would finish thejob .
you called this thing " the enemy .
you're saying it was an entity ofsome sort?
the navysays we weresent torecoverana bomb , that's why wegot all theseburns .
give me a freakin 'break .
whatever it was , we were sent to guard it .
this was what exposed the crew to radiation?
before it slithered away , back to where it came from , back into the sea , back into who knows what .
that thing ... is still down there !
the navy'll denyit , butyou've got to make sure the truth gets out .
i can trustyou to do that , can't i , mr. mulder?
you can trust all ofus .
excuse me .
i'm looking forwalter skinner .
he was brought in with a gunshot wound .
agentscully .
agent fuller .
this is agent caleca .
we got the call from the d. c. police .
how bad is he?
we don't know .
he's been in surgery .
what happened?
hothead drew a gun .
skinner happened to be in the way .
what doyou have on the shooter?
a description .
a handgun was recovered in the parking lot , unregistered , no prints .
our guys got two partials offthe cash register .
hair and fiber?
this happened a few hours ago .
this is the assistant director who's been shot .
we have to make all resources available .
excuse me .
how is he?
he came out ofsurgery all right , but he's in pain .
i've seen him before , the man who shot me .
give me the key .
when we get there .
i want to make sure we get there together .
give it to me .
what's " c. i. " mean?
when we get there .
how's he doing?
he's on steady demerol .
he's in and out .
i thought i asked for guards to be posted outside .
we put in a request .
this wasn't a random shooting .
i want guards posted here , and i want them here now .
it's a matter ofpulling men offsomething else .
i've heard the excuses .
i don't care ifyou and agent caleca have to stand out in the hallwayyourselves .
this man has to be protected , okay?
i thinkwe're being followed .
a dark sedan with its lights off .
it wasparkedon theshoulder abouthalfamileback .
speedup .
speed up .
get out .
get out .
where's the digital tape?
i don't have it .
hey , areyouallright?
i got a messageyou called .
goodmorning .
we found something i knew you'd want to see a. s. a. p. on the shooter?
yeah .
the partial prints we pulled from the cash register didn't add up to anything , but we found saliva on skinner's shirt that wasn't his .
this is an analysis ofthe secretors and other hemofactors .
which tells us we're looking for a male , probably in his 40s with blood type b positive .
we already know all that from the waitress's description .
there's more .
we were able to chromosome stain the hair fibers we picked up last night .
we still gotta find the guy before we can get a match .
we canrunhis indicators ... againstallsuspectsarrestedin the d. c. areain thelastcoupleyears .
that takes too much time .
you know what?
run it anyway .
can i borrow this for a little while?
go ahead .
thanks .
wepickedhim up lastnight .
theburnsaresomatic , caused by close proximity radiation exposure .
same as the french sailors aboard that salvage ship .
identical .
what's the prognosis?
it'sjust a matter oftime .
this kind ofabsorption will have a rapid effect on cellular activity , giving rise to the onset ofmassive and malignant cancers .
has anyone been in to see these men?
no .
yourorders were toisolate them .
butl think weshouldget aspecialistinherebecause , frankly , i'veneverseen anything like thisbefore .
i have .
doyou know what caused this?
have the bodies destroyed .
but but , sir , these men aren't dead yet .
isn't that the prognosis?
guess i'm not dead .
what happened?
maybeyou could tell me .
the state police found you unconscious .
you were strapped in the passenger's seat ofa rental car ... that had been driven into a ditch .
we were run offthe road by two men .
who's " we "?
krycek .
krycek?
he was in hong kong .
he's got the digital tape .
he's been selling information .
is that what the men wanted?
they ordered him out ofthe car .
i thought theywere gonna kill him .
i thought theywere gonna kill us both .
and then there was this bright fash .
that's all i remember .
well , it may not be the best time to tell you , but ... you're not the only one in the hospital .
skinner's been shot .
what's his condition?
a bullet perforated his small intestine .
the doctor seems to think he'll be fine .
who shot him?
i'm notsure .
but i have an idea .
what are those?
p. c. r. results .
this one belongs to the man who shot skinner .
yeah , and who does this one belong to?
the man who shot melissa .
you may all be wondering why i've called you here on such short notice .
we've received disturbing reports from our intelligence sources .
a french salvage vessel came into san diego , its crew all dying of radiation exposure .
its last given position was the site where we recovered the u. f. o.
how could they have got information about that location?
we haven't been able to determine that .
the frenchgovernment has deniedanyinvolvement .
well , they got those coordinates somehow .
it seems we have an information leak , gentlemen .
has our associate in washington looked into this?
apparently , hehas respondedto thesituation ... in a way that i don't think any ofus would have anticipated .
how doyou mean?
i don't have all the details yet , but i've asked him to come here and explain it himself .
hi .
how areyou feeling?
like someone's been inside my stomach redecorating .
what haveyou turned up on the shooter?
we've determined that the man who shot you is the same man who shot my sister .
i betyou had to work to get that , huh?
yes , i did .
you don't seem surprised .
three men came to see me a few days ago .
they warnedmeaboutpursuing yoursister'smurderinvestigation .
doyou realize whatyou're saying , sir?
i'm not advancing any conspiracy theory here , scully .
you're saying they closed down my sister's case ... not because oflack ofevidence , but because they didn't want us to catch the killer .
you should be very careful about the accusations thatyou make .
the man who shotyou you said thatyou'd seen him before .
several months ago , he was one ofthe men who attacked me ... in the stairwell , with krycek .
he was working with krycek?
they're the ones who stole the digital tape from me .
damnit !
krycek .
mulder had him .
listen tome .
anger is a luxury thatyou cannot afford right now .
ifyou'reangry , you'regonnamakeamistake , andthesepeople will takeadvantage ofthat .
you've seen how they operate .
i'll be okay .
scully
ifyou can't keepyour head , it's all right to step away .
that's exactly what theywant .

itlookedgreatonme in thestore .
what's this doing here?
i had it fown in from san diego as evidence .
evidence ofwhat?
the suit was covered in a thin film ofoil , as was the french diverwhen i found him lying delirious on his kitchen foor .
what kind ofoil?
from the reports i'm getting , it's the same substance ... that was found on the french diver's wife when she was discovered ... on the foor ofa hong kong airport bathroom a few days ago .
according to the analysis , it's 50 weight diesel oil , scully .
according to the analysis , it's 50 weight diesel oil , scully .
that's thesame oil usedon world waril submarinesandon p 51 mustangs .
i don't understand .
this oil is not only 50 years old , scully , but its composition has been altered by exposure to radiation .
i still don't understand .
how did this get onto the diver and then onto the diver's wife?
i don't think this isjust ordinary diesel oil , scully .
i think it's , uh
i think it's a medium .
a medium being used by some kind ofalien creature that uses it to ... bodyjump .
soyou're saying this stuff has intelligence .
i think that it came offof whatever they pulled from the bottom ofthe pacific ocean .
it's been waiting down there for 50 years for another host , another body to bring it up to the surface .
waiting tojump into the diver and then into the diver's wife .
and then to krycek .
krycek?
i think that mrs. gauthierwent to hong kong under the control ofthis thing to find krycek
i know i know how it sounds .
is anybody not looking for krycek?
no , but i think the $64, 000 question is , what is this thing looking for?
and now that it's in krycek , what does it want?
blue danube " ]
nothin 'to it .
you should call upon our services more often .
we show a talent for these g man activities .
you mean ifl want somebody whacked on the knee with a lead pipe?
only ifyou want thejob done right .
it's gone .
grenade !
where is it?
i've been expecting you .
put that down !
i have whatyou want .
you made us wait .
there was a weather delay on the shuttle from washington .
you had business there?
yes .
you , uh , may have already heard .
we've heard you acted on your own ... and moved the salvaged u. f. o. to another location .
these new attempts to recover it have increased our need for security .
who else is looking for it?
in the event , i moved it as a safeguard .
somebody better damn well find out how the french even knew where to look for it .
i can assureyou it'll be absolutely inaccessible now .
why not bring it to nevada , like the others?
leaks in security and a heightened public interest have made nevada unviable .
is this why i was called here?
no .
we'd like an explanation about this business ... with the assistant director ofthe bureau , skinner .
random shooting , for all i know .
they have a waitress who's given a description ofthe shooter .
theyreleaseda composite ofhis face to thepress .
one ofyours , isn'the?
i don't know what to tell you .
ifhe did , he acted on his own .
good lord .
this is a very serious exposure for us .
i'll take care ofit .
my advice toyou , sir , is to understand the priorities here .
get thisshooteroutofthe country as quicklyaspossible .
ifthe assistant director l . d. 's him , ourwell placed operatives won't be able to stand in the way ofan arrest , compromisingbeyondrepair thesecrecyofour work ... and the security , as you so arrogantly assert , ofour project's future .
it'll be handled .
i've got something here : writing .
somebodywrote on top ofthe package and left an impression .
let me see that .
your guys at the f. b. i .... turnedamajorserialmurderer witha vestigialpenimpression .
it does look like something .
your sci crime guys at the bureau have a laser there ... that can measure any change in a surface down to a few nanometers .
they canliftaperfect impression usingmagnetic toner andasheetofmylar .
an electrostatic device is appliedto thespecimen andrenders theinformation ... by drawing the toner from the indentations to the mylar surface .
actually  actually , it's a phone number .
new york cityarea code , 555 1012 .
now , don't drop that .
that's a finely calibrated piece ofinvestigative equipment .
i gotta make a phone call .
i'll be damned .
yes .
no .
this is a private line .
you must have misdialed .
no .
there'sno onehere to takeyour call .
i'm sorry .
i can't helpyou .
please hold on .
who is this?
who is this?
who gaveyou this number?
you probably know him .
a man named krycek .
alex krycek?
yeah .
nice guy .
killed my father .
you wouldn't happen to know where he is , doyou?
it's mr. mulder , isn't it?
it's so nice ofyou to remember .
mr. mulder , can we meet somewhere?
oh , i would love to .
giveyour phone number to my assistant .
he'll call you back in five minutes .
tell him i'll meet him in three hours in central park , near the lighted walkway off79th , near the reservoir .
when you hang up , have this number disconnected .
well , we got a name to go with the face .
beautiful .
hisnameis luis cardinal , native of nicaragua , school ofthe americas alumni , career mercenary , apparently impressed a lot ofpeople ... with his marksmanship during the lran contra deal .
i'll bet .
that's actually the good news .
whatdoyoumean?
he entered the country without a visa or papers .
we can't find anything on him : address , phone number , financials , nothing .
does he have an alias?
several .
none checked out either .
inaillikelihood , thisguy'salreadyoutofthe country .
damn it .
they think they canjust get awaywith it .
i wish i could tell you otherwise .
keep looking for him .
we've ... pretty much exhausted our avenues .
what's it gonna take?
at this point?
other than a sign from god?
i've seen stranger things , believe me .
i believe she has .
i trust we're alone .
we're all alone in new york city , sir .
you're looking foralex krycek , to kill him ... in revenge .
what makes you think we haven't done that already?
what for?
tell me whatyou know , and i'll consider giving you krycek .
no .
you answer a few questions for me first ,
iike what was pulled offthe bottom ofthe pacific ocean .
it was a u. f. o. , a so called foo fighter ... downed byamerican fighter pilots in the second world war .
left there until now?
there were salvage attempts .
a u. s. sub was sent in 50 years ago , but there were complications .
almost the entire crew died .
yes .
it's still a mystery .
a mystery to whom?
the cover story said it was the third a bomb bound forjapan .
but the truth is , no one knows what killed that crew .
i know .
doyou , now?
you give me krycek , and i'll tell you .
mr. mulder ,
i've given you so much this evening .
you've offered me next to nothing in return .
you haven't told me anything i didn't already know .
i'm curious .
ifyou've encountered krycek , why didn'tyou kill him then?
'cause he has the tape .
ah , yes , the tape .
the tape he's been selling those secrets off .
you don't know where he is either , doyou?
you're looking for him too .
mr. mulder , anyone can be gotten to .
certainly , you've no doubt ofthat .
mr. mulder !
scully .
scully , it's me .
those two guards you had posted outside skinner's room .
are they still there?
they should be .
why?
i wantyou to get down there and double check for me , okay?
i got it covered , mulder .
just get down there and check , okay?
nurse , what happened to the guards who were outside this room?
they've left .
where?
and what happened to the man in this room?
mr. skinner'snolongerapatienthere .
where is he?
the orderlies wereherea few moments ago , andtheytookhim away .
where did they take him?
to another hospital .
the ambulance must havejust left .
thankyou .
i'm with the f. b. i. areyou transporting a walter skinner?
yeah .
is there something wrong?
no .
everything is fine .
i'm just gonna ride with you the rest ofthe way , okay?
agent scully , what areyou doing here?
i just wanted to make sure you got whereyou were going safely .
what is it , scully? just lie still .
federal agent !
stop right there !
areyou luis cardinal?
areyou luis cardinal?
please .
areyou the man that shot my sister?
please don't kill me .
you shot my sister !
please .
i can tell you .
tell me !
tell me !
ican tellyou .
i can tell you whatyou want .
you want ...
krycek .
ican tellyou whereheis .
please !
please don't shoot me .
drop thegun !
put thegun down !
putitdownnow !
f. b. i.
don't move !
easy !
got him .
standback , please .
get up !
yeah .
mulder .
mulder , it's me .
where areyou?
i'm at the airport in new york .
what areyou doing?
i'm looking for my rental car agreement .
what areyou doing in new york?
i'll tell you when i seeyou .
mulder , your instincts were right about skinner .
wejust arrested a man forwhat looks like attempted murder .
who?
it's him , mulder , the man who shot my sister .
uh , scully
mulder , listen to me .
he says he knows where krycek is .
i don't know ifthis makes any sense toyou , but he says that he's headed towards an abandoned missile site somewhere in north dakota .
i wantyou to meet me at the d. c. airport in an hour .
i wantyou to get two tickets on the first fight to north dakota .
what's in north dakota?
the salvaged u. f. o.
there must be 200 silos out here .
ifl'm correct , theywere all filled with concrete ... in accord with the disarmament treaty when the base was decommissioned .
i didn't sign any disarmament treaty .
my ears are still popping .
we're eight stories down .
where's the concrete?
apparently , nobody else signed that treaty either .
one down , one hundred ninety nine silos to go .
these tunnelsmustgo on formiles .
he's here .
hold it right there !
halt !
hands in the air !
come on !
come on !
he's here .
you led him here , didn'tyou?
there's nothing here but holes in the ground .
why areyou here?
why all these men?
i don't oweyou any answers .
the u. f. o. 's here .
that's what krycek's after , isn't it?
krycek?
alex krycek disappeared five months ago .
we saw bodies in there .
men with radiation burns !
you saw nothing !
you won't get awaywith this !
you can't bury the truth !
take these away .
yeah .
agent mulder .
sir , i didn't expectyou back to work for a few weeks .
i was looking foragent scully .
there was something i wanted to talk to her about .
actually , i wanted to talk toyou .
i wanted to thankyou for everything you did .
you mean getting shot in the gut?
you got shot becauseyou stood up to these people .
i thinkyou're proceeding from a mistaken impression .
what i did i did because it's myjob .
from what i understand , you putyourjob and your life on the line for scully .
this isn't my crusade , agent mulder .
a woman was murdered .
i mistakenly thought we could bring the man who committed that crime tojustice .
what doyou mean , " mistakenly "?
that's what i need to talk to scully about .
i wasjust thinking about something that a man said to me .
that the
that the dead speak to us from beyond the grave .
that that's what conscience is .
that's interesting .
i never thought ofit that way .
you know , i thought ... when we found him , this man that killed melissa , that that when we brought him tojustice , i would feel some kind ofclosure .
but the truth is , no court ... no punishment , is ever enough .
i came here to tell you something , scully .
there may be somejustice , just not the kind you're looking for .
what areyou talking about?
they found this man , luis cardinal , dead in his cell .
how?
they made it look like a suicide .
the men he worked for couldn't take the chance that he'd point his finger at them .
and what about krycek?
oh , he was there .
i know that .
you think they got to him too?
i don't know .
but ifthey haven't , theywill .
i doubt it'll weigh on their consciences , though .
i think the dead are speaking to us , mulder , demandingjustice .
maybe that man was right .
maybe we bury the dead alive .
help !
h help !
uhh !
help me !
help me !
help !
help !
no !
help me !
help me !
help me !
help me !
