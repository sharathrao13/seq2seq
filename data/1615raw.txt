we can't let this continue
we need business
but we don't have anyone in charge now
and we don't know who's trying to kill mr. lung
mr. lung , you're the boss
mr. lung , you should give us some assurance
something like this happens periodically
how will outsiders look at us?
how will our men look at us?
frank is looking into it
everyone knows i'm the boss
if you have any good ideas then tell me
you're the boss , it's your call .

i accept my fate
go talk to my brother
i'm an old man
i'm tried to always having to serve someone else
take my life if you want it
your father came from shan ton to hong kong
we roamed about to take a living
we started with nothing , but we became an organization
we all put our heats into it
but there's one thing i don't understand
can you tell me ...

finish the job before you leave
so people know we mean business
understood
let's move
enjoy the food , curtis , i'ii go get the shark fins
sorry for the trouble

i thought i was going to do this job for 8 or 10 years
but the moment we struck back
they just fell apart quickly

we should get together and make some money

don't count me in , i still prefer cutting hair
james?
friendship forever

curtis
my brother wants you guys to take this
thank you
i want to say good bye to mr. lung
don't disturb him
in the old days when we finished a job all we did was go out dancing and got massages
there was this crazy old man
but he's already dead
he gave everyone a bag of cocaine after each job
what do i need that for?
shit
these days ...
the organization treats everyone impartially
my brother doesn't know about this
it's only between the two of us
what?
my sister in law
she had an affair with shin

go ask him
what if he says it's true?
i'ii take care of it
