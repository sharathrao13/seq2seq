a young man searching for love in all the wrong places .
his name was frank .
we're moving through time .
what?
hi .
my stepsister , like , i sometimes worry that she eats too much .
shut up , kim !
i'm just trying to help .
0h , sweetheart , please !
there's no reason to be embarrassed here .
many times we eat because we are afraid to face our ego reflection .
we find ourselves looking at the mirror , rather than into and through the mirror .
when we do that , we can finally see how beautiful we are .
thanks !
sure .
come up here .
don't be afraid .
er , how can i find out what i wanna be when i grow up?
0h !
that's a hard one .
well , look deep inside of yourself , deep within your heart , and find what makes you feel love pure , unconditional love and go to that .
in your studies , in your athletics , in your relationships , go towards love .
thank you .
come on up .
next .
how do i learn how to fight?
" how do i learn how to fight?
son , violence is a product of fear .
learn to truly love yourself
truly love yourself and the world will be yours .
0k .
get yourself up here !
all right !
good morning .
good morning !
um ...
how much are they paying you to be here?
er ...
excuse me?
what's your name , son?
gerald .
well , gerald , i think you're afraid .
do you want us to buy your book?
because that was the worst advice ever .
see how sad this is?
want your sister to lose weight?
tell her to stop eating twinkies and play field hockey .
no one knows what they want to be .
it takes time to find that out .
right , jim?
and you ...
yeah , you .
sick of some jerk shoving your head down the toilet?
well , lift some weights or take a karate lesson , and next time kick him in the balls .
son ...
see this?
this is an anger prisoner , a textbook example .
prisoner .
do you see the fear , people?
this boy is scared to death .
son , it breaks my heart to say this , but i believe you're a very troubled and confused young man .
you are searching in all the wrong places .
you're right , actually .
i am pretty troubled and pretty confused .
and i'm afraid , really , really afraid .
really afraid , but i ... i ...
i think you're the fucking antichrist .
it's amazing .
he thinks he's telling the truth .
everything he says is a fucking lie .
everything he says !
everyone thinks he's so rad .
he's such a fucking chud ...
are you 0k?
sit down .
calm down .
you ever hear of grandma death?
who?
the philosophy 0f time travel " .
what is this?
she wrote it .
i'm ...
i'm seeing stuff ...
like really messed up stuff .
that book describes stuff i've been seeing , and it can't just be a coincidence .
she must be in .
she never leaves this house .
maybe she's asleep .
donnie , look .
send her a letter .
each vessel travels along a vector through space time , along its centre of gravity .
like a spear .
pardon?
like a spear coming out of your chest .
um ...
sure .
yeah .
in order for the vessel to travel through time , it's got to find a portal , a wormhole or ...
could these portals ...?
could these portals just appear anywhere , any time?
i think that's highly unlikely .
no , you're talking about an act of god .
if god controls time , time is pre decided .
i'm not following you .
every living thing follows a set path .
and if you could see your path , then you could see the future?
that's a form of time travel .
well , you're contradicting yourself .
if we were able to see our destinies manifest themselves visually , then we would be given a choice to betray our destinies .
the mere fact that this choice exists would make all preformed destiny come to an end .
not if you travel within god's channel .
i'm not going to be able to continue this conversation .
why?
i could lose my job .
0k .
it gives me no pleasure to deny you one of the great writers of the 20th century .
alas , i have not yet been elected queen of the universe , so i must obey the rules .
so , anyone seen in this school reading this book will be suspended .
not to worry .
someone pre ordered a dozen copies at the sarasota mall bookstore .
in mr greene's absence , we will now be reading another classic " watership down " .
here , donnie .
pass these back .
maybe you and frank can read this one together .
now you know where he lives .
and they grow out of our ... chest , solar plexus?
just like she described , the way they moved and they smelled .
it's like they're workers .
assigned to each one of us .
they just ...
they're like liquid .
i followed it into my parents 'bedroom .
what did you find?
nothing .
so we call them imgs .
infant memory generators .
you buy these glasses for your infant , and they wear them at night when they sleep .
but inside the glasses are these slide photographs .
each photograph is of something peaceful or beautiful , whatever the parents want .
what effect would it have on an infant?
well , nobody remembers their infancy .
anybody who says they do is lying .
so , this will help develop memory earlier in life .
yeah .
did you consider that infants need darkness as part of their natural development?
no .
yeah .
what if the parents put in pictures of satan or dead people?
is that what you'd show your kids?
er , well , i mean , didn't your dad , like , stab your mom?
get out .
gretchen !
gretchen !
gretchen .
i'm sorry about those guys .
two for " evil dead " , please .
that'll be $2 .
why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?
why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
take it off .
what happened to your eye?
why do they call you frank?
it is the name of my father .
and his father before me .
frank ...
when's this going to stop?
you should already know that .
watch the movie screen .
there's something i want to show you .
have you ever seen a portal?
burn it to the ground .
0k .
now , girls , i want you to concentrate .
failure is not an option .
and , bethany , if you feel the need to vomit up there , just swallow it .
0k , mom .
hey , you guys , good luck out there .
now , that was really something .
thank you , cherita chen , with " autumn angel " .
now the moment we've all been waiting for .
it is my pleasure to introduce to you emily bates , suzy bailey ,
samantha darko , beth farmer and joanie james .
they are sparkle motion .

# not wild about it

# who says they're part of our lives?
# you own the money , you control the witness
# i hear you're lonely , don't monkey with my business
# you pay the profits to justify the reasons

# that's why i've done it again
# no no notorious ... #
how long was i asleep for?
whole movie .
well , look what the cat dragged in !
how you doing , donnie?
your little sister was broken hearted that you missed her big show last night .
dad?
hm?
i'm crazy .
you're not crazy .
i used to be crazy .
but you're not crazy .
look , you're my only son ...
i know ...
no , hold it .
i know i'm not the best communicator , but ... .. whatever happens to you , be honest , tell the truth , even if they do look at you funny they will .
but what you gotta understand , son , is that almost all of those people are full of shit .
they're all part of this great big conspiracy of bullshit .
and they're scared of people like you .
because those bullshitters know that you're smarter than all of them .
you know what you say to people like that?
hm?
fuck you .
the blaze was extinguished sometime after 8 . 00 last night .
firefighters discovered what has been referred to as a kiddie porn dungeon .
cunningham , who has become a recent celebrity for his books , was arrested ...
0h , my god ! .. while at sarasota heights country club .
arson has not been ruled out as the cause of the fire .
now a group of cunning vision employees ...
dad played golf with that guy . .. vehemently denied the alleged link to a child pornography publishing circuit .
ln a vicious statement , connie attacked fire department officials , claiming a mass conspiracy .
i'm sorry , karen .
this is a progressive school , but we don't feel your methods are appropriate .
what exactly about my methods are inappropriate?
i am sorry that you have failed .
now , if you'll excuse me , i have another appointment .
you can finish out the week .
fuck !
good afternoon .
it's a great pleasure to announce that the middlesex ridge school dance team has been invited to perform on " star search '88 " in los angeles .
i know now a terrible thing is coming .
what do you mean?
the field , the field .
it's covered with blood .
blood?
don't be silly .
all right .
it's getting dark .
we should get back to the burrow .
back to the burrow?
it'll come there .
it's all around us !
stop it , fiver .
we've got to leave here .
when the other rabbits hear of fiver's vision , do they believe him?
why should we care?
because the rabbits are us , donnie .
why should i mourn for a rabbit?
is the death of one species less tragic than another?
0f course .
a rabbit's not like us .
it has no history books , no photographs , no knowledge of sorrow or regret .
i'm sorry .
don't get me wrong , i like rabbits .
they're cute and horny .
if you're cute and horny , you're happy .
you don't know why you're alive .
you just want to have sex as many times as possible before you die .
i just don't see the point in crying over a dead rabbit ... who never even feared death to begin with .
you're wrong .
these rabbits are the product of the author's imagination .
he cares for them , so we care for them , otherwise we've just missed the point .
aren't we forgetting about the miracle of storytelling?
the deus ex machina?
the god machine?
that's what saved the rabbits .
no , it was ridiculous .
i'll call you back .
rose .
kitty .
i'm sure you've heard the horrible allegations against jim cunningham .
i know .
something about a kiddie porn dungeon ... 0h , please , please !
don't use those words !
it's obviously a conspiracy to destroy an innocent man .
i'm spearheading the jim cunningham defence campaign .
rose , i have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning .
the girls have to leave for los angeles .
as their coach , i was the obvious choice to chaperone them .
but now you can't go .
yes .
now , believe me , of all the other mothers , i would never dream of asking you .
but none of the others are available .
i don't know , kitty .
it's a bad weekend .
eddie's in new york .
rose , i don't know if you realise what an opportunity this is for our daughters !
this has been a dream of samantha's and all of ours for a long time .
i made her lead dancer !
sometimes i doubt your commitment to sparkle motion !
elizabeth will be in charge .
she'll drive you to therapy .
and if you need anything , you promise me that you will call dr thurman?
how does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
it feels wonderful .
here ...
sorry !
here you are !
you guys are gonna win .
i know it .
so do i.
here's the keys .
there's food in the fridge and do not ...
mom , go .
you're gonna miss your plane .
mom , i need ...
there's nothing broken in my brain .
i know .
bye , donnie .
0k , go .
go !
hello , donnie .
it's friday .
shouldn't you be off with your friends , scaring old people?
what's going on?
i don't know .
that's a good question .
i'm no longer your english teacher .
they fired me .
that's bullshit !
you're the only good teacher here .
thank you .
what's " cellar door "?
this famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the english language , of all the endless combinations of words in all of history ,
cellar door " is the most beautiful .
cellar door .
i promise that one day everything's gonna be better for you .
shut up !
i want to talk about your past .
no .
l want to talk about you and your parents .
they didn't buy me what i wanted for christmas .
what did you want for christmas that year?
hungry hungry hippos .
how did you feel , being denied these hungry hungry hippos?
regret .
what else makes you feel regret?
that i did it again .
you did it again?
i flooded my school and i burned down that pervert's house .
i only have a few days left before they catch me .
did frank tell you to do these things?
i have to obey him .
he saved my life .
i have to obey him or i'll be left all alone .
and then ...
and then i won't be able to figure out what this is all about .
i won't know his master plan .
do you mean god's master plan?
do you now believe in god?
i have the power to build a time machine .
how is that possible?
how is time travel possible , donnie?
time's up , frank said .
when is this going to happen?
soon .
what is going to happen?
frank is gonna kill .
who is he going to kill?
who is he going to kill?
i can see him !
the sky's gonna open up .
if the sky suddenly opened up , there would be no law , no rule .
there would only be you and your memories , the choices you've made and the people you've touched .
if this world were to end , there would only be you and him ... .. and no one else .
you can stop taking your medication .
they're placebos .
just pills made out of water .
thank you .
donnie ...
an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of god .
you're an agnostic .
an agnostic is someone ... who believes that there is no proof of the existence of god , but does not deny a possibility that god exists .
goodbye , dr thurman .
hey .
i got in .
i'm going to harvard .
hey , we should totally throw a party .
mom and dad are gone .
it's halloween .
we could get away with it .
0k .
but it has to be small .
we got eggs , water balloons and a dozen rolls of toilet paper .
i stole four beers from my dad .
we got a keg .
keg beer is for pussies .
rose , this is lilian thurman .
it is important that you call me as soon as you get this message .
thank you .
you 0k?
yeah .
my mom's gone .
you want to come in?
l0ve wlll tear us apart " by j0y dlvisl0n )
i don't know .
she didn't leave a note and the house was all messed up .
but you're 0k .
did you call the cops?
yeah , they said i should leave the house and that i should go to a safe place .
i'm just so scared .
i keep thinking something awful is happening and ...
it's my fucking stepdad , i know it .
i guess some people are just born with tragedy in their blood .
hey , have you seen frank?
no , they went on a beer run .
lf you're there , please pick up .
oh , well .
good news .
the girls got three and a half stars and are in the quarter finals .

dear roberta sparrow , i've reached the end of your book and there's so many things i need to ask you .
sometimes i'm afraid of what you might tell me .
sometimes i'm afraid that you'll tell me this is not a work of fiction .
l can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep .
l hope that when the world ends ,
l can breathe a sigh of relief because there will be so much to look forward to .
