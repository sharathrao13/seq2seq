right , then .
go straight to the office ...
don't dawdle on the way
don't worry
i'll call in 30 minutes to check
oh , hello fujio
is your mother here , too?
why are you outside?
it's no fun listening to women's talk
well , why don't we go in together?
i'm fine out here
right , you wait out here
aunty !
tell mom ...
if she's not out soon , i'm leaving !
i'll tell her
mrs. ishino has arrived
good
welcome
please come in
i hope you're well
been here long?
a little while
you're very pretty , today
you look stunning , today
today you're really beautiful
what's with the '" today today '"?
she always thinks she's beautiful
cheeky !
that's a lovely wrap !
you're being sarcastic
you bought it at mitsukoshi?
no , is it too earthy?
earthy?
you don't feel it is?
how old are you?
old enough
terrible , terrible
what's so funny?
isn't that it?
perhaps you're right
getting a lot of lines recently
grows older?
you don't have to spell it out
only when laughing , though
i've tried it in front of the mirror
see , no lines that time?
isn't there?
let's hear it again
reminds one of a zoo
cheeky !
gotta give it up
fujio is tired of waiting
you'd better leave
can you solve this?
what?
if you have thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins ...
and you're short 2 sen on a bill of 130
how many of each denomination did you have?
what is it?
fujio's homework , from yesterday
he's starting junior high this year
the preliminaries are so complicated
and if i can't do the work he's been set ...
it kept me up till 2 a .
m
working on this?
yes .
go on , solve it
thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins ...
2 sen short on a bill of 130
forget it .
it's our cross to bear
wait .
if you call it x ...
you can't do it like that !
no using algebra
a total of 32 coins ...
and no using real coins !
right !
i've got it !
it just takes patience no , that's wrong too
you don't have to get upset about it
they don't do this in junior
if you could do it you'd say they do
couldn't the doctor find me a tutor?
perhaps from among his students
i simply can't do it myself please ask him
you worry too much
i don't really care who just so long as he's clean
you're just after a fredrick march type
that would be lovely
please , i'm serious
i'll keep my eyes open
don't forget , will you?
please , for fujio's sake
you're leaving?
off to the ginza today's act of motherly love
my niece from osaka arrives here tomorrow
it'll be good to see her again
i like the girl
she's such a smart , tidy girl
goodbye !
goodbye !
didn't know you had a sister like this
be serious .
silly
goodbye
i'm getting hungry is there anything to eat?
there are some biscuits
something a little more solid?
like what?
what is there?
noodles?
noodles?
how about sushi?
a bit too cold ...
then what ...
rice?
topped with eel .
but then again ...
you're hard to please
rice with a helping of eel on the side
in a tiered box
you eat a lot !
is one enough?
if not , i'll have biscuits
stupid !
is the doctor home?
no , he's at the university
right , he teaches on wednesdays
it's nakanishi on the phone
i'll take it in here
hello , i'm just testing now
it looks bad for you
you'll never have children
tidy this up , please
sir , it's time for your class
which room?
number 27
okada !
the book i ordered has arrived
can you bring it to my place?
'" salmonella was rife in the town of frankenhausen '
when dr. gartner discovered the baccilus name ... ... after him in 1888
the mode of infection is yet to be discovered
but a detectable relationship ... ... has been established with the spirochette ... ... of the encephalitic bacterium which reaches epidemic proportions
nowadays , what we call encephalitis ... ... was identified by a dr. ekonomo in vienna in 1919
whether the tow are the same or not is still a matter of speculation
looking beyond these questions ... ... at dr. ekonomo's diagnosis of lethargic encephalitis ...
like our friend here there's no evidence it attacks during winter
so he doesn't have it
ready?
going back to the original question ...
setsuko !
setsuko !
no , i'm actually very good
i can drive at 60 kph on route 2
it's such a good feeling
you want to come along?
no thanks
your family doesn't object?
i see , but it sounds dangerous
you see , i'm the best road racer
shall i show you?
so here's where you are
i'm talking to uncle
first put your bags away
she's learning to drive
drive?
there'll be none of that in tokyo !
restrict your accidents to osaka , please
you smoke?
yes , i do
it's bad for you !
but you smoke !
put it out .
you're still a minor
i'll just finish it off
setsuko !
mind you wash behind your ears , young lady
are they dirty?
clean them for me
ugh !
how dirty !
master okada is here
good day
please come in
am i intruding?
not at all .
this is our niece
setsuko , mr. okada
i owe a lot to your uncle
sir , i brought your book
good lad .
sit down
it's alright .
please
it's alright .
please
how'd you like to be a tutor?
what subject?
arithmetic .
exam preparations
for fujio
in junior high , already?
will you?
but children and i ...
it'd be easy for you .
please do it
but the doctor ...
he approves , don't you?
then it's settled?
you'll do it?
good !
but mrs. komiya ...
it's been decided
thanks a lot !
you're stuck with it
seems so
area of the sea is 3 times that of the land 3/ 4 of which is in the northern hemisphere
how many times is the area of the sea in relation to land in the northern hemisphere?
how many times ...
well , that's ...
3/ 4 of the sea is in the n. h ...
wait , i just have the thing !
it's easy when you use this
that's a good idea !
3/ 4 of the area ...
ethiopia's over here
how many times is the area of the sea in relation to land
come in .
hello
studying?
did you get question three?
how does it go?
the earth's area becomes 1 , then land area equals 1/ 4
so land in the n. h. is ...
1/ 4 times 3/ 4 = 3/ 16
therefore , the area of the sea ... understand?
1/ 2 minus 3/ 16
where'd you get the half?
this?
by calling the area 1 ...
the n. h. becomes one half
oh , really?
so the equation is 5/ 16
that's the sea area
so 5/ 16 divided by 3/ 16 ... ... is 1 and 2/ 3 , that's the answer
yes !
that's right !
where'd you graduate from?
the university
you did graduate?
yes , i did
junior high , too?
yes .
and you studied arithmetic?
of course
so we've nothing to worry about
so it seems
er ...
ma'am ...
setsuko?
please come in
hello
it's been a while .
come in
everything's fine?
yes , thank you .
you always look good
you too , you look younger every time i see you
your flattery has improved
i mean it
your aunt's not coming
no , but i remembered you like these
thank you very much
this is from aunty
oh , really !
she helped get a tutor for fujio
mr. okada?
he's been very helpful .
he's here now
is he?

france !

'" hit the spot '

it's not easy !
have a try
i will
ready !
north pole
that's cheating !
is arithmetic so difficult?
yes .
can't make any headway especially today's question
really?
i don't think i could pass his exam myself
what a teacher !
i'm serious
an unreliable teacher !
uncle?
are you working?
i came for a quick smoke
aunty's rather strict
still playing golf?
yes , i am
i play most saturdays
how did it go?
about 33 34
that's quite big
i got quite good but i gave it up
i got callouses and didn't really have time
because i'm studying classical voice
so you sing '" kiyomoto '"?
yes and my teacher praised my rendition of '" ochudo '
is that so?
you're not golfing today?
i have to work on this so i won't go today
really?
you still here?
do you know the time?
i'm pondering whether or not to go
why?
you must go the exercise is good for you
i'm going out for a while
setsuko , i want you to stay until i get back
uncle , are you going?
looks like i have to
then i'll be here alone
well , someone has to stay
okada !
professor , please come in .
hullo
nice quiet place you have here
sardines , they look delicious
playing golf today , sir?
i'm thinking
working on your thesis?
can i leave these here?
you're not playing today?
no , and i'd like to stay here overnight
stay?
here , sir?
will i bother you?
no , please do
and say nothing to my wife
i'm going out for a while
yes , sir
to a bar in the ginza why don't you join me later?
the doctor is late today
you always seem to wait for him
you know why they call this '" dimple '"?
the blender's name?
because of the dimple just like this one
really?
you're not just kidding me?
no , truly
welcome
you're late
i'm sorry
no clubs?
i'm not going today
why?
just don't feel up to it
is that so?
maybe i'll pass , too
my wife thinks i should play on saturdays
she kicked me out the house !
that's sad , but go play , anyway
and post this for me while you're there
to your wife?
i always send her one
i see
so what'll you do today?
well , you know ...
know what?
madame , he's picking up the tab today
it's not what you think
then why don't you pay?
and you , beware of the bunkers !
that was just a bad day for me
i think i'm getting a cold
you should be careful
a good looking man
who is he?
that's mr. uehara
mr. uehara?
i thought all the girls knew him from kanagawa
oh , that uehara
where are your clubs?
i left them at a friend's
a lady friend?
don't be silly
uncle !
setsuko , what's this?
how did you find me here?
a lucky guess .
you're a good man
it's terrible that she makes you go play golf
that almost made me despise you
what are you drinking?
i'll have the same
fix me one , please
you shouldn't be drinking
don't worry
you'll get drunk
come on
i can handle 2 or 3 with ease
i'd like to visit a tokyo geisha house
what?
please take me
you're not returning home tonight , are you?
come on !
let's go
well done
you want another one?
i've had plenty
what a bore !
setsuko , you've had enough
leave me alone
want one?
thank you
tokyo geisha , you have real class
thank you
good to see you , professor
tonight again .
you're here with a beautiful young lady
my niece .
she's bubbling with vigour
a rare beauty
thank you
please enjoy yourselves !
thank you very much
uncle?
you never tire
so it seems
may i see it
i really like it .
do you want to swap?
don't mind , it's alright !
but yours is so ...
never mind , take it please
i've taken a shine to yours
it's time we were leaving
i don't want to leave yet
i can sleep here tonight
come on , we're going
you have to get back
but my head hurts so
why such a hurry?
setsuko !
we're leaving !
we've got to get you home
can you carry me?
i'm supposed to be golfing
it just can't be helped !
please call okada at this number
tell him to come at once
no !
i'll stay here
fumiya !
you never answer me !
setsuko's late .
when did she go out?
about four o'clock
and it's past 1 am !
should i go and look for her?
no idea where she's gone , so where would you look?
she's back , ma'am
i'm back
still up?
where've you been?
around
you've been drinking !
a drop or two
such a troublesome girl !
setsuko !
come here !
sit down !
don't go getting upset
you're not supposed to drink
you're still a minor !
now sit down !
don't worry !
setsuko !
wake up , young lady !
i said wake up !
where've you been out drinking until this hour?
setsuko
i was fast asleep
felt good .
don't want to hear anymore
what if something happened while he's away at golf?
you're our responsibility !
i've been worried sick !
you could help by getting me a glass of water
setsuko !
quickly !
ma'am , the car that brought her home ...
with mr. okada?
was it raining when you got up?
i wonder when it started?
probably around dawn
i hadn't reckoned on that
we were due for a change
they're cooked , sir !
thanks !
it's really pelting down
it certainly is !
that's not good
what do you mean , sir?
i sent a postcard saying the weather was fine
a friend posted it from the golf course
he should realise he's not that kind of man
really , sir?
that is a problem
it's not joking matter
you think it rained in izu?
i can't tell
nationwide , don't you think?
that is a problem
they're done , sir !
fumiya?
is aunty home?
home all day?
she has no plans to go out
fumiya
fumiya
coming !
where's setsuko?
in her room
she's not to go out
sure
the master is back
welcome back
to unseasonable weather
how did it go?
just so so
by the way ...
i'm angry with setsuko
soon as you left , she was out the door !
carousing until one o'clock !
came home dead drunk !
drunk , you say?
she treated me with contempt !
and didn't listen to a word i said
she came back with young okada
with okada?
if anything happens while she's in our care ...
you have a point there
i want you to lay down the rules to her
right !
send her to my room !
you uncle wants a word with you
uncle !
ah , setsuko !
i need a favour
yes?
the postcard i had sent ...
i don't want your aunt to see it
why not?
i wrote that the weather was fine
just leave it to me will
you've been at okada's all this time?
yes
i've got a terrible hangover
aunty's in a terrible rage
she's said barely a word to me all day
it was bad luck she found out okada's role in this
fumiya saw us together
and she's taken it the wrong way
i wouldn't mind if he were at least handsome
understand !
look at me !
don't go gazing away !
on your feet , young lady !
i'm telling you for your own good
when you go out , you tell us where you're going !
and you can't stay out late !
you should know better !
remember what he says , young lady !
you understand?
and pay heed to what your aunt tells you !
you hear me?
what a good liar !
i'm surprised
but ...
you're good and okada and i are never right !
this time you've no excuse
and pay particular heed to what your aunty says
you understand?
that wasn't her .
it was the wind how stupid !
professor , this is very hard on me
she got very angry with me
said i betrayed her trust and barred me from the house
she misunderstood and it's more than i can bear
sir , please explain
sir , i'm begging you
i considered telling her the truth
you're right , but please just bear with it
i'll return the favour one day .
please?
i let him have a piece of my mind
i introduced him to you but now i wash my hands off him
he seems so upright , a lad of morals
what is it?
i'm embarrassed to say it
say what?
what?
you are
but we've been married for 14 years
congratulations !
it's nothing to be ashamed of
even hippos have babies
stupid !
dr. komiya could attend to you
i'd be indebted for life if he did
your husband will be thrilled
he's sick in bed , now
since when?
how's your husband?
why do you ask?
well , playing golf in the rain
rain?
that's strange ...
'" weather's fine '" , '" great for golf '
that is strange
the master has returned
uncle , something dreadful has happened
she read the postcard !
i thought i'd get to it first she's certainly fast
dear !
you played golf with sugiyama?
apparently it rained
what's the meaning of '" great for golf '"?
aunty , forget it
you shut up !
it doesn't matter if it rained or not
you shut up !
out , get out of the room !
out !
now !
isn't it strange?
the same golf course and he gets wet ... you bathed in the sunshine
if it rains the weather is certainly not '" fine '
'" great for golf '" , did it rain all around you?
he got bad cold
can you explain how that happened?
can you tell me why?
your guests are leaving
you should see them off
i'll get to the bottom of this
i'm hungry
ask for eel .
they do wonders with it
why the hurry to leave?
stay a little longer
why don't you take your time?
i was going to order eel , your favorites
yes , but ...
you'll leave?
see you soon
fumiya , our guests are leaving !
fumiya !
fumiya !
don't forget
the master?
he left through the garden
that was close .
they barely made it
your aunt is fuming !
don't worry about it !
are you really frightened of her?
not what you'd call frightened
then why so glum?
drink up
you worry too much about her
that's why she walks all over you
i'm just the niece .
you're the husband !
the master !
if it were me , i'd tell her !
fickle like the weather i'd make her change !
but ...
i couldn't
you can , you just don't
want to go to the geisha house?
i'll pay
uncle , let's go
uncle .
doctor !
let's go !
welcome home !
where've you been?
setsuko !
where did you go?
where?
you've been drinking again !
i told you before !
what have you two been up to?
setsuko !
answer me !
speak up !
say something !
we went for a walk
setsuko !
i've had enough of you !
enough !
back to osaka !
she doesn't have to
you shut up !
out !
go home !
not at your command
i'll go when i'm ready !
what?
you put her up to this !
that's why she's so insolent
you're the insolent one !
i treat you well and you try to walk all over me
just think a little
if she doesn't want to go , she doesn't have to
well done !
she needed that that made me feel good
i'll sleep well tonight
i'll go to bed , goodnight !
aunty !
i was very rude
please forgive me !
it just slipped out
it all became so complicated
of course he's wrong , too
he didn't play golf that day
perhaps i shouldn't say this
but sometimes he doesn't want to
he stayed the night at okada's place
before that , he was with me
i'm sorry i drank and made a fool of myself and made you worry
forgive me !
i was wrong
so of course you're right to be angry with me
but i feel sorry for uncle
i was wrong and i ask for your forgiveness
you weren't wrong
so you don't have to say sorry .
but ...
please forgive me !
i'm sorry for what i did
i couldn't control myself ... but hitting you was wrong
you have a right to be angry , but forgive me
it was very wrong of me
no , i made a mess
she said you stayed at okada's instead of going to golf
well ... yes
you believe me?
i didn't know so i just assumed the worst
i didn't have a chance to tell the truth
okada came out worst of all
i'm grateful you understand me i'm sorry !
i'm truly sorry
well ... goodnight !
dear ... !
why the funny face? !
uncle !
what is it?
i covered for you
there was no need for you to apologise , too?
she had to
you started out well but finished terribly
let's see it again !
the man should be stronger
that was sufficient
not at all
that's something you don't understand yet
some men treat their wives badly
but that's not a good thing
wives should be respected
they like to think they're in control so it's better to let them think that ...
like scolding children by praising them
that's the best way , the opposite approach
opposite approach?
i've never thought about that
i've have to remember that
i would like to see that
a real hard one?
how many times?
once .
where?
across the face
a good solid whack?
yes
did it hurt?
not really ... no !
my husband's a wimp , not so much as a love tap
with a face a like that ...
fool !
you think it'll suit him?
too colorful
what?
he's still young
i'll get one , too
sorry for you , no one to buy for
what about fujio?
stupid
when's setsuko leaving?
we're eating out tonight and she'll leave from there to take the 9pm express
you should've brought her along with us
but she's out shopping with okada
'" opposite approach '"?
i didn't know , myself we're both a couple of fools
don't use it when we marry
no , i'd never
you probably will
i'm the straightforward type
flattery will get you nowhere
if you do , i'll use the '" opposite opposite '" approach
when are you coming again?
for the college baseball match
i'm a waseda fan
i like waseda , too
flattering again sounds like '" opposite '
this time tomorrow , i'll be in osaka
i wonder where she is by now?
around numazu , i guess
she's probably fast asleep
probably
the house seems very lonely with her away
she'll come again , soon
it'd be nice to have her come often
yes
would you like a coffee?
i won't be able to sleep
you'll sleep well
fumiya !
goodnight !
