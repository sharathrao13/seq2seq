vassili zaitsev .
on this day , september the 20th , 1 942 ,
" a shepherd boy from the urals ...
arrived in the city ofstalingrad , on the banks ofthe volga .
his name is vassili zaitsev .
like thousands before him , he came to answer comrade stalin's call .
armed with a rifle , he quickly made the fascist invader realize that ...
from now on he would be punished for every step he took in the motherland ; that from here on , the only way was back .
what do you think?
i think comrade commissar's been overgenerous .
let mego !
let mego !
byorderofcomrade stalin , no civilian can ieave the city .
get back !
standaway , or we wiii open fire .
standaway !
get back !
get back or we shoot !
back !
keep back !
make way for comrade stalin 's envoy !
i carried out my orders .
i sent in all of my boys .
but the germans engulfed us .
they have artillery , aircraft , tanks .
and me , what did i have?
the sacred duty to resist !
i have to report to the boss .
perhaps you'd prefer to avoid the red tape .
my name is ...
nikita sergeyevich kruschev .
i've come to take things in hand here .
this city is not kursk ... nor is it kiev , nor minsk .
this city is stalingrad .
stalingrad !
this city bears the name ofthe boss .
it's more than a city , it's a symbol .
ifthe germans capture this city , the entire country will collapse .
now , i want our boys ... to raise their heads .
i want them to act like they have balls !
i want them to stop shitting their pants !
that's yourjob .
as political officers , i'm counting on you .
you , what's your suggestion?
shoot all the other generals who have retreated ... andtheir chiefs ofstafftoo .
m make some examples .
d d deport families ofthe deserters  yeah , that's all been done .
give them hope !
here , the men's only choice is between german bullets and ours .
but there's another way .
the way ofcourage .
the way of love ofthe motherland .
we must publish the army newspaper again .
we must tell magnificent stories .
stories that extol ... sacrifice , bravery .
we must make them believe in the victory .
we must give them hope , pride , a desire to fight .
yes , we need to make examples .
but examples to follow .
what we need ... are heroes .
do you know any heroes around here?
yes , comrade , i know one .
that'sme !
vassili zaitsev .
that's me !
no , you're not dreaming .
it's your name .
we made the front page .
they haven't changed a word .
do you have any idea what this means?
it's not the back page , it's not the second page ,
it's the front page .
the front page !
they're going to reprint our article everywhere .
in the caucasus , in the crimea , even in the urals .
tomorrow morning , stalin himself will be sitting over breakfast , reading my words , memorizing your name .
we're famous , vassili .
kruschevlovedthe article .
he's promoted me to the general staff .
and you to sniper division .
well , that's good .
it's very good .
it's very good .
it's great .
it's very great !
it's great !
for us because we did it together .
together !
although i did all the hard work .
oh , yeah?
you're very lucky i can't fight back .
why's that?
because kruschev told me to make sure nothing happens to you .
you're too important .
i'm too valuable .
yes , careful of my careful of my glasses , please .
they're new .
sorry , sir .
i'm famous !
we're famous !
i'm famous !
i'm famous !

good evening .
comrade zaitsev?
my god , where does all this mail come from?
from all over the country , mrs. filipov , from all over .
this one's from the workers ofthe kouzbass .
they want to name theirmine after vassili .
right , let's start with the miners .
come on , let's get to work .
dearcomrades from the kouzbass ,

he's vassili zaitsev .
i saw your picture in the paper .
thankyou foreverythingyou're doing .
and this is his friend , commissar ...
danilov .
danilov .
tania is like a daughter to me .
she used to take care ofsacha when i worked at the factory .
she even taught him german .
all these books are hers .
oh , they're yours?
she studied german at the university .
which university?
moscow .
moscow .
moscow .
shouldn't we , uh
yes , let's continue .
yourofferto name yourmine afterme ... is ... a great honor .
h o n.
yes , i know .
honor .
very good .
shouldn't we make the point that i'm not the only one fighting?
that that's exceilent exceilent idea , vassili .
we can take it even further though .
oh .
we can take it further .
yourbattle for theproduction ofcoal ... is as worthy as mine .
there's no " k " in coal .
just just one " l.
oh , teilme ifl'mgoing too fast .
no , you're not going too fast .
you sure?
ijust thought is there anyotherimprovements?
why don't you get some rest?
these letters can wait until tomorrow .
we shouldcarryon .
we're not tired .
thankyou , mrs. filipov .
these people ... took the trouble to write to us .
tomorrow , we may not be around to write back .
major konig , herr general .
i was expecting someone ... else .
certainly not someone so prestigious .
i imagine you have your reasons ... for getting yourself involved in this hellish situation .
myarmy isnot designed forthis kindoffighting .
yesterday , yet again , ihadtopromote ... 25 sergeants to replace the officers shot down by their sharpshooters .
thosesnipersare demoralizing mypeople .
this city is no more than ... a heap of ruins .
but the fuehrer's persisting .
he has made it a personal matter between stalin and himself .
we should trust the fuehrer's instinct .
he always managed to lead us to victory .
we shailbe backhome forchristmas .
how are you going to go about finding this young russian?
i'll fix it so that he's the one who finds me .
vassili .
vassili .
come on , time to get up .
what?
they have a problem in the department store sector .
they need us .
come on .
look , vassili , he'shiding in the departmentstore .
overthere .
so farthismorning , he's knocked off five officers , plus two machine gunners .
look , thirdfloor , fourth windowfrom the ieft .
fourth window from the left .
see him?
yeah , i see him .
there , yougot him !
greatshot .
let's go get his dog tag .
good bye , comrade commissar .
thankyou foryour hospitality , mrs. filipov .
you can borrow whateveryou like .
i'm not sure what they would say to me at headquarters ... if i came back with an armful of goethe and schiller .
there's some marx too .
you were assigned to civil defense at the 1 2th district?
no , i volunteered .
it's such a coincidence meeting you like this .
comrade kruschev was telling mejust yesterday ... how desperately we're in need ofoperators who speak german .
i can't .
our militia's responsible for all the people in this neighborhood .
we're already desperately short of men .
we'll give you a dozen soldiers for every one that speaks german .
i'd rather stay and fight .
serving at headquarters is fighting .
you'd be far more useful there .
youstayhere .
you coverus .
ailright .
we go .
take care .
ludmilla , come on .
check the stairway .
it's a trap .
i know .
move back .
he's still here .
they're coming straight for us !
ludmiila , stay where you are , he's over there somewhere .
we have to get out of here !
we have to get out of here !
just stay where you are !
what are we gonna do?
ludmilla , stay where you are !
fuck this , i'm going .
ludmilla , no !
what does this mean?
the little shepherd from the urals receives a new sniper's rifle ,
a mosin nagant 7 . 62 , with its 3 . 5 power p. u. telescope .
pride of precision ofsoviet production .
i've seen that rifle close up .
have you?
i've even touched it .
i know him well , vassili zaitsev .
ludmilla and anton were killed today , and it was my fault .
no , i'm sure that's not true .
there was a german sniper .
i walked them right into his trap .
what else canyou teilme?
he didn 't relocate .
a sniper who doesn't relocate isn't normal .
he was verygood .
it wasn 'tjust his shooting , it washis instinct .
he was a step ahead of me all the time .
that's because he knows everything about you .
his name is konig , major konig .
they've sent him here to ki to find you .
at first we weren't sure ifthe information was reliable .
it seems he's come all the way from berlin to stop you .
you've caused them so many sleepless nights , they sent their top marksman .
what do we know about him?
he's a major in the wehrmacht .
he's director oftheir sniper school in zossen .
koulikov studied under him at zossen before the war .
he knowsailhis tricks .
from nowon , he'llgo withyou everywhere .
a nobleman from bavaria who hunts deer ... against a shepherd boy from the urals who poaches wolves .
it's more than a confrontation between two nations .
it's the essence ofclass struggle .
i'm glad you're so happy .
he had all the advantages .
next time you'll be even .
no one shoots like you , vassili .
she's been transferred .
i'll see ifthey're ready foryou next door .
hello .
you look smart in your new uniform .
make sure they don't take it back once you've finished .
yeah , they probably will .
i've heardthe rumorabout the german , andi wantedto wishyou iuck .
thankyou .
i'll need it .
from what comrade danilov tells me , you're going to win .
hmm .
it's time . @@@@@@ [ russian ]
vassili !
vassili !
come to my arms .
look in my direction .
put your cap back on , you look more heroic .
this way , comrade zaitsev .
i love this little fellow .
vassili , is it true that you volunteeredforthe front?
howoldareyou , vassili?
do you know what this duel means for our country?
is it true you killed your first wolf when you were five?
areyouproudto be chailenged bythe bestsharpshooterin germany?
the germans are starting to shit their pants .
go on , myboy , teii ushow you'regoing to deai with him .
or rather , no .
tell it to the boss .
one more question , please .
he likes good hunting stories .
look at him with pride , because he's looking at you .
the whole country is looking at you .
forgive me , forgive me , grandfather .
so , it's not the wolfthat chooses the hunting ground ... but the hunter .
but i'm sure your grandfather taught you that .
except in this case ,
i'm the game .
however , today what we'regoing to do ... is iure the wolf out ofhis iair ... to where we want him to be .
you're the one whose life is valuable .
you go first .
no , no .
we take it in turns .
next time is your turn to go first , andthen it'syou , volodya .
son ofa bitch !
these are new pants .
i just took them offa captain from the 251 st yesterday .
sixteen months i spent in germany at the school in zossen .
ofcourse , those were the days when we were friends with the krauts , : when ourjoseph andtheiradolph ... were walkinghandin hand .
from here to the wire , 160meters , right?
one hundred and fifty five .
whatever .
that'llmake 'em sendout a repairguy .
let's relocate .
aah !
hey , volodya !
after the germans invaded us , it wasn't the same atmosphere anymore .
threw my ass in prison .
what were you doing in germany , huh?
excuse me , says i , but it was comrade stalin who sent me there .
don't bring our glorious leader into your treachery .
confess , spy bastard !
confess .
and bang !
bang , bang , bang !
well , there wasn't a sickle , but there was a hammer .
and bang .
knocked out all my teeth .
that's right , boy .
have no iilusions .
that's the land ofsocialism and universal bliss foryou .
hey !
it'syourrepairguy .
i got him .
it's about soup time , isn't it?
i'm going .
weil , get a move on , volodya , andtrynot to spiilit aii onyour wayback , you marxist bastard .
the enemy sniper activity reported during the past 24 hours , herr major .
two sentries shot in the train station sector .
one artillery observer in the northern sector .
one lieutenant from the 24th panzer division in the factory sector .
three telephone repairmen in the workers'housingsector .
theyalso teilme we havejust taken aprisoner who may interestyou .
i hope he's still able to speak .
excuse me , sir?
nothing .
thankyou .
so , teii us , volodya , which building ishe in?
there is no way i know that .
he moves around all the time .
hejumps from one to the next .
on which floor?
i don't know .
we'll see about that .
undress him .
put him in one ofouruniforms .
you see , they are stubborn .
that's the good thing about the germans .
man , you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads
right .
let's see ifour customer has arrived .
are you ready?
uh huh .
and now our famous shepherd from the urals , who major konig thinks is an idiot , gets up to make sure he has hit his target .
majorkonigseeshim .
aims for his helmet .
fires .
revealshisposition andis shot in turn .
except ...
major konig doesn't fire ...
because major konig isn't there .
koulikov !
don't you think that was strange , that last one?
they sent him out to get shot like the others .
it's not natural .
not without artillery , without trying to cover him .
oh , no , i'm the one who was stupid .
they don't give a shit about telephone guys .
i mean , it's like us with the ukrainians .
they'd never bother a major over a few dead grunts .
tomorrow , we'll kill us some generals .
whose turn is it?
mine , i think .
oh , you're such a cheater !
you can't fool papa koulikov .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , it's my turn to go first .
and it's your turn to get a hole in your britches .
to victory .
this sniper business has been dragging on too long .
what's that little fellow ofyours up to?
he's probing , comrade kruschev .
he's testing the germans for weaknesses .
he's meticulous in his preparation .
vodka ... is a luxury we have .
caviar is a luxury we have .
time is not .
he's aware ofthat comrade kruschev .
we both are .
i assure you he will succeed .
good .
it seems your destinies are entwined .
they're keeping you busy .
i picked this up in the kitchen .
it's from the reception the other day .
i thought mrs. filipov might like it .
um , she will be thrilled .
that's very sweet ofyou .
there's plenty more ifyou're hungry .
you'rejewish , aren't you?
there's nothing in our religion that says you can't eat sturgeon .
my father had a premonition all this would happen .
you mean the war?
he understoodthat the hatred ofthejews ran deep .
he was saving up to buy some land in palestine .
he said it was the only land we truly belonged in ; the only land we had a duty to defend .
he insistedilearn to use a rifle .
i learned to shoot .
i know that in times ofwar , personal feelings should be put aside , but ...
i have a favor to askyou .
ofcourse .
anything you want .
i want to be reassigned .
what's happened , tania? @@@@@@ [ russian ]
heshot him .
he shot him even though hejumped first .
shot him on the run .
it was an impossible shot .
i've neverseen anything iike it .
you've promised people a victory i can't deliver .
i don't stand a chance against this man .
you mustn't talk like that , vassili .
what ifltoldyou we found a wayto trackhismovements?
we've got someone , vassili .
someone close to him passing us information .
next time you will be one step ahead of him .
i promise .
@@
now i have a favor to ask .
from me?
it's about tania .
come in .
he doesn 't even knowyou exist .
but at that moment , you are closer to him than anyone else on earth .
you see his face through the sight .
you see whether he shaved that morning or not .
you can see whether he's married by whether he has a wedding ring on .
it's not like ... just firing at a distant shape , notjust a uniform .
it's a man's face .
those faces don't go away .
theycome backandtheyjust theyget replacedbymore faces .
did danilov askyou to tell me this?
he likes you very much .
i think he'd try anything to change your mind .
did he tell you why i asked for the transfer?
no .
thismorning , a iist arrivedat headquarters .
it was a list ofcivilians who'd been ... rounded up and sent to germany in a convoy ... that left stalingrad three weeks ago .
my parents were amongst them .
after 30 kilometers , the german soldiers ... stopped the train and forced everyone out .
in the middle ofa bridge , they bound them together , two by two .
mothers with daughters .
husbands and wives .
they ... lined them up against the railing , and then they fired a single shot at each pair ... to save bullets .
it worked .
the bodies ofthe ones who died dragged the others under the water .
i know they died together .
they never would have let themselves be separated .
that's koulikov's rifle .
it's a good ... rifle .
thankyou .
i know how he leaves the shelter .
he goes through the tractor factory .
the tractor factory is big .
i know exactly where .
he crawls through a gutter , under a grate where the vats are , then he goes out from the workshop .
in between the two , there'saplace where he's in the open .
it's under a long , iron foot walk .
good luck , comrade .
i know exactly where he's waiting for me .
he'll be on the foot walk over the gutter .
we'll take him out from behind .
we'll get to the other end ofthe workshop through these pipes .
foilowme .
you go that way .
i'll go around this way .
okay?
shit !
sergei , you should go back .
no , i'll be all right .
go back .
no , you go !
keep your legs in .
come on .
come on .
come on .
comrade stalin is asking for one last effort !
the fate ofthe motherland isat risk !
the fate ofailthose you love andcherish !
it's for them that we fight today .
listen to me , tania .
the germans are throwing everything at us .
ifthey're lucky , one in ten ofthese soldiers will come back alive .
you're highly educated .
you know languages .
every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives .
every message you decode kills thousands oftheirs .
you have a duty to survive .
vassili was born to fire a gun .
it's what he knows .
you and i were born for a different purpose .
ifvassili were here , he would tell you the same thing .
where is he?
where is vassili?
keepyourheaddown .
tell me where he is .
stay into thatpipe , tania .
stay in .
stay in !
get your head in !
slow down .
don't shoot .
he's over there .
do you see the pillar in front ofyou?
ineedyou to move roundbehindit .
go .
tania , ineedyou to find a iargepiece ofglass .
piece of glass .
doyousee the kiln ... behind me to the left ofthe factory?
yes?
i can't hearyou .
yes .
yes .
do you see ... the two louvers?
yes .
do you see the one ... with a broken slat?
yes .
this is what i want you to do .
are you ready?
yes .
three ... two ... one ...
hello , sacha .
he was right where you said he'd be .
nearly there .
he's very clever .
tell me about him .
why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father?
his father's dead .
his mother too .
does he talk about his father?
no .
he didn't know him .
did he go to school?
he knows how to write .
he answers lots of letters .
hmm .
is it girls who write to him?
everyone writes to him .
is there a girl he loves in his village?
not in his village , here .
does she love him?
yes , because he's handsome .
because he's brave and she's very beautiful .
i know her well .
she's from my neighborhood .
she went to the university .
they're handsome together .
later , the two ofthem wiilget married .
at least , i think so .
and you , sacha , why are you helping the germans?
because they're stronger .
because they're going to win the war .
and because you like chocolate , huh?
@@@@@@ [ dance ]
ailthesepeople here knowthey'regonna die .
so each night when they make it back ,
it's a bonus .
excuse me .
so , every cup oftea , every cigarette ... becomesa iittle celebration .
because fora iot ofus , it maybe ourlast night .
it'sjust something you have to accept here .
everyone has their time .
in the forest , the wolfiives forthreeyears , the donkey for nine .
so , that's that's got to be a proverb from the urals .
it makes no sense to me whatsoever .
the donkey lives longer because he's more useful .
makes absolute sense .
there aren't any donkeys in the forest .
you made it up .
so ...
i'm a donkey?
people like you and danilov ... have to survive this .
people who have read books , had an education .
we'll need you when the war is over .
andifyousurvive?
what will the useless vassili zaitsev do then?
i wanna work in a factory .
my granddad took me to a factory once .
there was thisman there , high up on a on a foot walk .
he wasn't wearing blue like the others .
the people he was supervising didn't understand what they were doing .
but for him , for him up there , it was simple ; it was clear .
and i thought , " one day , i could be that man .
sad to have a dream you know won't happen .
why shouldn't it?
you'll outlive us all .
hmm .
you'll be the oldest donkey in the forest .
150metersstandbetween the germansandthe volga .
todaythe whole world is watching these 150meters .
they are what makes stalingrad ... " the capitol ... ofthe war .
your friend , tania ... have you see her?
she stays over there now , with the snipers .
tell the major we're sending in all ofour sharpshooters ... to support the attack on the factory .
tell him vassili will be there .
i need to talk to you .
sure .
i need to talk to you .
sure .
danilov .
hmm?

he did it of his own accord .
you know why?
because he believes in you !
tomorrow morning , we're going to take back the chemical factory .
sacha's informed the major you'll be there , so now you know where you have to wait for him .

what did i tell you?
you've been playing your fiddle too much !
if it's confirmed that he's dead , we're sunk !
weil , you'resunk .
it isn't true .
it was intercepted from their staff headquarters .
what do they have to do , dangle his body in front our our men?
they're lying .
that's good .
very good .
write it , then .
vassili zaitsev is not dead .
this is what he had for breakfast this morning .
this is a picture of him reading today's newspaper . " you're the poet .
what?
you won't give up the riverbank !
idon't care ifyou've iost halfyourmen !
lose the other half , or lose yourself !
is he back?
he should be back soon .
the german attack cut the lines .
that's why he's late .
can we go outside?
i wrote to my mother about you .
she wantedme to teilyou that once this war was over , ifthere's anything you needed anything at all our family will be there foryou .
you know i'm here foryou .
they're saying vassili is dead .
vassili zaitsev will never see his loved ones again .
surrender !
this isyouronlyhope .
you're upset .
because zaitsev is dead?
you don't have to hide it .
there's no shame in it .
you're a russian like he is .
don't iisten to them .
it'sjust propaganda .
he isn't dead .
and do you know why?
indistinct ]
i'm going to tell you a little secret .
only you , because i know i can trust you .
but you must swear to me that you won't tell another soul .
you swear?
i found a terrific spot .
it's by the exit from the train station .
i'll hide in the water tower .
tomorrow .
i'ii wait forhim there .
you'll see .
he'll be there .
he always is .
i also want you to swear that from now on , you'll stay home where you belong .
do you swear?
yes?
good .
we know he's alive .
we know he won't fail us .
we know because he is a part of us now .
vassili is eternal .
where have you been?
we've looked everywhere foryou .
oh , didn 'tyou hear?
i wasdead .
at ieast the noble sniper zaitsev ...
vassili was dead .
the real one .
me ...
i was asleep , andlmissedmychance .
then , i was curledup in a corner , hiding ... from a man who wants to kill me .
i'll talk to kruschev .
he'll send you back to your old division .
where's tania?
she's at the shelter .
i've been to the shelter .
itoldheryou weren't dead .
the major said so .
he said the other germans were lying .
he told me you were waiting for him at the station .
vassili .
vassili .
vassili .
my little sacha .
i knew it .
vassili .
tania .
i knew you weren't dead .
how?
because we onlyjust met .
i prayed for the first time since i was a little girl .
when i opened my eyes , sacha was standing there ... waiting to give me the good news .
i think he loves you even more than i do .
to thepropermilitaryauthority ,
i'm calling to the commandant's attention the recent changes noticed ... in the attitude towards fighting ofsoldier vassili zaitsev .
he hasattemptedon severaloccasions to escape his duties , voiced doubts on the chances ofour victory ... and made defeatist comments in public .
the inexplicable duration ofhis duel ... with the nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by ... his lack of belief in the communist ideal .
good morning , sacha .
once again , he knew exactly where to find me .
don't you think that's strange?
apart from me , only you knew .
i don't hold it against you , sacha .
you've done a very brave thing .
you've chosen your camp .
i respect that .
but it isn't my camp .
we're both soldiers , and we're both enemies , so i know you understand .
i'm annoyed with you , little sacha , for not staying home as i made you swear to .
i'm annoyed with you for obliging me to do what i'm going to have to do .
i've never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep .
how long have you been watching me?
all night .
you've been snoring away happily for hours .
i don't snore .
do i?
like a pig .
i suppose i talk in my sleep as well .
yes .
there's something i should tell you .
on the train ... coming here ... we were in the same car .
no .
i saw you .
you were reading , and you fell asleep .
i didn't dare look at you , you were so beautiful .
it was scary .
afterwards , i couldn't stop thinking about you .
it made me smile .
and then i thought ofall the men who would get to hold you ... who'd make you laugh ... how lucky they were .
and now i'm the one lying next to you .
and now i'm the one lying next to you .
was i snoring?
like a pig .
what?
oh , my god !
oh , no .
oh , my god !
tania , no .
tania , no !
no , get off me !
get off me !
get off me !
it's what he wants !
this is what he wants !
get off me !
no , he'll kill you .
he'll kill you !
let me go !
i'll run afteryou , and he'll kill me .
let me go !
let me go !
this is what he wants !
i'll get him .
i promise i'll get him .
i'll get his rifle foryou .
i promise , tania .
i need you .
you have to leave now , mrs. filipov .
stalingrad may fall .
the last ofthe boats are leaving .
the germans will be here any moment .
he's brought you a pass .
you'll be safe on the other side .
gatheryour things , and we'll help you carry them to the landing stage .
i'm not leaving .
this is my home .
this is my sacha's home .
i can't leave .
ihave to teilyousomething , mrs. filipov .
something very difficult to understand .
it's about sacha .
he's gone over to the germans .
he's betrayed his country .
he's with the enemy now .
he won't be coming back .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
he's become a traitor .
thepoorlittle thing .
what hashe done?
so , he's going to stay over there?
yes ... he's going to stay over there .
ishouldn 't besaying this , comrade commissar , but maybe it's for the best .
ifthe germans have won , he'll be safe .
iknowit's wrong , butperhaps he hasmade the right choice .
oh !
oh , tania !
tania?
oh , tania !
tania !
oh , my god !
oh !
i need a doctor !
a doctor !
i have a pass .
i have a pass !
you must let her cross .
please !
it's useless .
she'll never make it .
no !
no , she will !
she's my daughter !
she's my daughter !
i beg ofyou !
all right .
oh , thankyou !
put this one on the boat .
where is he?
where's the major?
a few inches from your face .
i've been such a fool , vassili .
man will always be man .
there is no new man .
we tried so hard to create a society that was equal , where there'dbe nothing to envyyourneighbor .
but there's always something to envy .
a smile ... a friendship .
somethingyou don't have and want to appropriate .
in this world even a soviet one there will always be rich and poor .
rich in gifts ... poor in gifts .
rich in love ... poor in love .
tania isn't coming back .
she's dead , vassili .
she was cut down byshrapnel .
it was quick .
idon't think she even sawit coming .
she was on her way back to you .
as soon as she had seen mrs. filipov to the boats , she was coming back foryou .
she wasright .
you're agoodman , vassili .
i want to helpyou , vassili .
let me do one iast thing .
something useful for a change .
let me show you where the major is .
don't do that .
don't do that !
today , february3 , 1943 , isan ominous day forhitler ... andthe endless columns ofhundreds ofthousands ofgermanprisoners .
it is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland .
after 180days ofheroic combat ... in the market city ofstalingrad , andasa result ofthe valor andself sacrifice ofoursoldiers , the commander ofourgloriousredarmy ... received the unconditionalsurrender ... ofthe german fascist invaders .
sorry .
no , young man , i cannot find ...
a matching name in the book .
could you check again?
this is the address and her name .
she isnot here .
yes , this is our address , but we don't have her anymore .
this is the address .
she'sbeen here .
i'm so sorry .
she wrote to me .
ilookedthree times .
she'snot here .
believe me , there isno tania chernova .
ican't helpyou .
i'm so sorry .
