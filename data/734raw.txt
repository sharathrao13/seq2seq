hyper metal sonic , the only thing left is to capture his essential life data .
then you will be complete .
when you awaken , it will be time !
sonic !
it's finally done !
see , isn't it great?
it's a jet propelled body board !
come on , sonic .
don't you want to try it too?
no thanks .
all right , i'll try it myself !
i guess tails is still just a little kid .
come on , sonic !
it's okay if you can't swim !
you should give it a try !
just don't get cocky and run into something .
i must be hearing things .
sonic !
help me !
wake up , sonic !
come on , sonic !
shut up , tails !
sonic .
are you all right , sonic?
i'm fine , but who was that?
sonic , how have you been?
oh no , not that old man again !
i'll pass on this one .
sonic , we've got to hurry up and do something !
you're the one who can fly , why don't you go do something?
sonic , you idiot !
fine , i can take care of this all by myself !
mister !
mister !
tails , it's you !
it's nice to see you again .
i have some urgent business with sonic .
that's why i'm here .
mister , this isn't the time to worry about that .
your rocket's on fire !
what?
no wonder it's getting so warm in here !
just hold on !
i'll fix it somehow !
i'm not finished yet !
hey , you're pretty good at this , tails !
i got some practice in earlier on my body board .
that's amazing !
mister , up ahead !
look out !
what are you talking about?
let's see .
sonic !
thank you , sonic !
old man !
hey , old man !
ouch !
old man , you should stop flying those dangerous things .
what are you talking about , sonic?
i know i'm a little older now , but back in my heyday i won the speed races on planet freedom all the time .
believe me , i was pretty popular with the ladies back then too .
mister , didn't you say you had some urgent business?
oh , right .
it's a real emergency .
it's the president .
he wanted ...
he wants us to come to the presidential palace right away?
right , that was it !
please hurry !
old man , you could have just called to tell us that .
oh , yeah , i guess i could've done that .
old man , take care of the place while we're gone !
i understand !
i don't think so .
let's go , tails !
bon voyage !
mr. president , what's the urgent business?
right , the business .
it's been a long time , hasn't it , sonic , tails .
it's eggman !
please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way .
that's a funny way to show your gratitude .
don't do it , please !
sonic , for the sake of my daughter and everyone else , listen to him !
that's a dirty trick , eggman .
eggman !
you kidnaped them so you could take over south island , didn't you?
do you think really think i would do something that underhanded?
of course !
listen , sonic .
this concerns all of planet freedom , so you'd better listen to everything i have to say .
no way .
don't you care what happens to pretty , young sarah?
help me , papa !
sarah !
sonic , please listen to what eggman has to say !
i guess i don't have a choice .
go ahead and talk , eggman .
really , sonic?
as both of you are aware , planet freedom is made up of two separate dimensions .
the outer world , the one you live in , is known as the land of the sky .
we already know all that .
quiet !
just shut up !
and the inner dimension is known as the land of darkness .
i live peacefully in the inner dimension , where i have created a high tech city called eggmanland .
black eggman .
i don't know where he came from , but he attacked my city with a battalion of robots .
they completely conquered us .
now , there is no place down there for me to live .
black eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored .
he jammed the robot generator , causing it to run wild .
according to my calculations , if the robot generator isn't stopped by sunrise tomorrow , there will be a giant explosion !
fine !
but don't blame me when this happens !
what can we do to stop this , eggman?
someone has to get through all of black eggman's traps .
then he has to get into eggmanland and stop that generator !
and it's the fastest one here that should do it !
forget about it .
you're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place .
why should i have to clean up after you?
sonic !
please do it !
south island ...
no , the entire planet is depending on you !
sonic , i don't care what happens to eggman or papa , but please do this for both of us !
when eggman speaks , 99 times out of 100 he's lying .
but what if this is that one other time?
sonic !
sonic !
fine , i'll do it .
sonic ...
tails , take this with you .
what is it?
it's a navigator .
it will guide you to eggmanland using the shortest route , as long as you keep it with you .
thank you , eggman .
come on , tails .
tails , do you really trust that weird , little gadget that eggman gave you?
knowing him , he might've put a bomb in there .
eggman is the only one that knows how to get to eggmanland .
we don't have any other choice but to trust this thing .
guess you're right .
even more importantly , i hope that the president and sarah are all right .
no , no , no , i don't like it when you win every time !
all right , one more time !
that's enough !
give up !
we've played a hundred times !
i'll stop being your hostage .
all right , we'll keep playing .
no , no , no , you won again !
fine !
i quit .
i want to go for a drive .
absolutely not !
no , no !
i want to go for a drive !
how did this get here?
you rock , eggman !
i get to drive first !
don't touch that !
no , wait !
don't play with that !
stop it , sarah !
no , stop that !
sarah !
that must be the entrance to the land of darkness !
we're getting some bad turbulence here , so hang on , sonic !
all right , here we go !
hang on , sonic !
we're almost out of here !
tails !
tails , are you all right?
i'm fine , but i'm worried about that tornado !
so this is the land of darkness !
eggmanland should be straight ahead !
all right !
let's hurry !
tails , doesn't something seem a little strange?
i think eggman purposely picked the route with the most traps !
but this really is the quickest way to the generator !
there's even be a warp zone right up ahead !
let's get moving !
what is this place?
let me check .
we just exited the warp zone , so this should be ...
it says these are ancient ruins .
ancient ruins?
these?
i never knew the land of darkness had any of this .
but eggmanland is supposed to be really near .
let's go somewhere high and see if we can see it from there .
let's go !
the ruins are sinking right into the ocean !
sonic , i bet it's because the robot generator is out of control and causing reactions under the ground !
right !
we should hurry !
i'm afraid of lightning !
tails , we just have to go straight ahead , right?
that's what it says .
that has to be black eggman !
that is correct .
i am black eggman .
i congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here .
we don't have time to play your little games !
get out of our way !
i don't think so !
hold still !
ouch !
you fool , this armor is made of a super polymer alloy !
ouch !
ouch !
you ...
where are you little brats hiding?
come out here !
we don't have time to mess around with this guy !
which way to eggmanland?
let me check ...
that way !
it's past that highway !
good !
let's go , tails !
okay , sonic !
black eggman , you slowpoke !
what?
we know you can't keep up right now , so we'll just have to finish this game later .
no way !
this is bad !
i didn't know that thing could fly !
sonic !
tails , grab onto me !
we're safe !
don't think you're safe yet .
neither one of you can swim , so you'll both drown in the ocean below .
i can't swim !
gurgle , gurgle , gurgle ...
i've finally gotten those two out of the way !
that worked pretty well .
yeah , let's go .
why me?
crash !
crack !
boom !
oops !
you fools !
did you really think i'd fall for a stupid trick like that?
take this !
what is this stuff?
sonic !
tails !
now , it's time for this !
now , i just have to finish you off .
there's no way those missiles could've gotten rid of sonic so easily .
i told you !
it's coming back at you , black eggman !
sonic !
oh no !
darn !
you might have the fastest feet in the world , but it you can't run , you're just a normal hedgehog .
you will never make it to eggmanland !
try to run away from this !
sonic , i'll save you !
knuckles !
hurry and save sonic !
oh no !
if my tails are stuck together , i can't fly !
i've got it !
sonic , grab onto this !
who are you?
sonic , you can do it !
oh no !
i'm out of ammo !
you are lucky , aren't you !
however ...
not lucky enough !
i owe you one , knuckles .
right back at you .
it doesn't matter .
you're running away?
i'm not going to let you go , black eggman !
don't worry , we'll meet again soon !
grab onto me , sonic !
sonic's ruined things again !
he'd better enjoy this feeling now , because once he gets to eggmanland , he'll have to fight something even worse than black eggman !
what do you mean , worse than black eggman?
you're talking about yourself !
you'd better keep your hands off my sonic , or i'll never forgive you !
thanks for saving us there , knuckles .
yeah , that's one more job that i'm not going to get paid for .
oh well , we've been friends for long enough .
i guess i can just put this on your tab .
so will you return to treasure hunting?
of course !
after all , that's what i live for !
the sun's already setting !
we've got to hurry !
what is that thing?
that's eggmanland !
incredible !
i hope we see you again , knuckles !
see you .
see you later !
knuckles !
hey , i'd worry about you two if i sent you in alone !
see you !
what are you waiting for?
if you don't hurry , that thing's going to explode !
wait up , knuckles !
so this must be the entrance to eggmanland .
i never expected eggman to live in such an awesome place !
this is no time to be blown away .
you're right .
come on , let's go !
it's this way .
keep going straight ahead !
got it !
i'm really starting to get excited about this , sonic .
just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it , knuckles .
i'll be fine .
sonic , leave these guys to me and go on ahead !
all right !
good luck !
tails , fly !
you have to fly !
yeah , right !
it's too heavy for me to move !
hang on !
i'll stop this thing !
sonic !
i'll have you out of there in no time !
oh no !
gotcha !
sonic , are you all right?
something's moving !
it's a robot that looks exactly like sonic !
what does all this mean?
what is that?
it's pretty !
black eggman's ghost !
it's broken .
watch where you're putting your hands !
i'm sorry , i didn't mean to !
ow !
stop it , sarah !
please stop , sarah !
sarah !
why are sarah and eggman here together?
i get it , you're black eggman !
it wasn't my fault !
look at that , now you've made her cry .
black eggman and the haywire robot generator were all part of his scheme .
he planned the whole thing to trap you !
what does all this mean , eggman?
i don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here .
now this will be your burial place !
good job , sonic !
what did you say?
you're kidding me !
this is the greatest invention of eggman , scientist extraordinaire !
i call it the hyper metal sonic .
pretty good , don't you think?
you might have made a robot that looks like him , but he's no match for the real sonic !
tails , it should be apparent to you .
sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier .
instead , i was transferring all his data to the robot .
he is the fastest , most powerful battle machine every to walk planet freedom !
what are you planning on doing with that thing?
isn't it obvious?
i'm going to use metal to destroy the real sonic , and then i'm going to destroy the land of the sky .
what did you say?
there's no way you'll get away with this !
let sarah go , eggman !
tell me that after you've defeated him .
go get him , hyper metal sonic !
tails , knuckles , don't try to help me .
i want to take him out on my own !
man , he's fast !
this is the first time i've ever seen sonic like this !
incredible !
absolutely incredible !
that is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever !
he's in trouble !
sonic !
keep going , metal sonic !
sonic !
wait , tails !
sonic !
hold up , tails !
but if we don't hurry then sonic ...
calm down , tails !
there's no way that either one of us can catch up with them .
we've got to think of another way !
what?
that's right .
he did say something about destroying the land of the sky , didn't he?
i'm sorry , was that uncomfortable , sarah?
come on , don't be mad .
just stay with me a little bit longer .
no , i want to go home now !
if you just wait a few more minutes ,
i'll show you something really spectacular .
where did he go?
that's it !
perfect !
perfect !
sonic has finally been defeated !
tails !
hey , tails , what's wrong with you?
that's a warp zone right in front of us !
we're catching the tornado , and we're going home !
hey , hey , what about sonic?
what a nice , peaceful night .
sonic , you're back already?
sonic , what's the matter?
please stop it !
where am i?
tails ...
i remember leaving eggmanland .
impossible !
i've got to stop metal !
is this all part of black eggman's plan , too?
oh man !
the only one that would do something like this is eggman !
it's a lucky thing no one was staying here .
that old man was watching the house for us !
old man !
old man !
it doesn't look like anyone touched the inside of this place .
old man , where are you?
tails , is that you?
are you back already?
those are sonic's favorite clothes !
don't blame me if he gets mad at you !
don't worry about it .
sonic came back last night .
he forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away .
he flew away?
it's metal !
metal is really wreaking havoc here .
at the rate he's going , the land of the sky won't last more than a few hours .
now i can take my plan to the next stage .
here you go , sarah .
this is a present for you .
yahoo !
you rock !
tails , stop tinkering with that thing !
let's hurry up and find sonic !
hold on a second .
this machine that eggman gave me and metal sonic are built out of the same kinds of parts .
i think i can use that .
really?
you might be able to find metal sonic?
but what if metal sonic and sonic aren't in the same place any more?
don't worry .
sonic and metal will definitely be together .
i don't get it .
how come?
well , all of sonic's data was input into metal's memory .
his personality , his likes , his dislikes , even all his thoughts .
that's why he knew to come here .
he even gave the old man his favorite clothes .
i understand that , but metal's still a robot .
even if he is a robot ,
metal is operating on sonic's thoughts and motivations .
he knows everything that sonic's ever seen or felt .
the same goes for sonic .
in other words , it's just like they're twins .
they're twins , huh?
green lake city has been flooded !
forest town is currently on fire !
we've discovered the source of the disturbances .
we'll patch it through to the monitors .
sonic !
lmpossible !
get sonic's house on the line immediately .
yes , sir .
shut up already , i'm busy !
isn't somebody going to pick that up?
hey , tails !
isn't anyone there?
oh no , not that idiot !
what's he doing now?
hey , it's me !
listen to me right now !
shut up !
who is this?
who are you?
i'm knuckles , sonic's best friend .
i see .
is sonic there?
is sarah safe?
what happened to black eggman?
did you stop the generator?
you sure are an annoying old man .
i'm busy here !
mr. president !
look , eggman , don't i look cute?
yes , it suits you very well , sarah .
but why did you give me a wedding dress?
what do you mean?
once metal has destroyed the land of the sky , it'll just be the two of us .
then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together , sarah !
go to sleep , go to sleep , close your eyes ...
are you crazy?
who told you i wanted to marry you anyway?
i won't do it !
never !
so that's what really happened .
but i still don't think it will enough to destroy the land of the sky .
it's possible .
i've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet , and i've seen it .
at the northernmost tip of this continent , all the continents in the land of the sky are linked by a huge glacier .
many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents .
they're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier .
if the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion , the magma would pour directly into the glacier , melting all the ice .
what do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support?
due to the centrifugal force of the planet , they'll be thrown into outer space .
this is impossible !
mr. president , please don't tell sonic a word about any of this !
i know that !
why am i not supposed to be told about this , tails?
sonic , you're safe !
it's too late .
i heard all of it .
sonic , you don't understand !
let me explain !
metal sonic has turned northward and is moving at top speed .
what did you say?
metal is planning to melt the glaciers to the north !
we must stop him at any cost !
roger !
sonic .
tails , sonic just disappeared .
he must have gone after metal .
he went north !
we'll have to do our best too .
we have to stop metal no matter what !
he's headed to the north pole .
that means metal has finally found the point of destruction .
here we go , sarah !
no , no !
i don't want to get married at the north pole !
why me?
hold on tight , we're about to hit a warp zone .
no !
i told you to stop !
stop !
all right !
now we have to access metal's memory banks and adjust them .
then maybe we can awaken sonic's personality in him !
tails , are you sure we can trust that thing?
after all , it used to be eggman's .
don't worry about it .
just keep your eyes open for sonic .
i know what to do !
oh no , i'm too late .
where'd he go?
he's got to be around here somewhere !
what?
then this will be the real fight .
we'll fight until only one of us is left standing , all right , metal?
what?
this world isn't big enough for the both of us , you say?
well , the feeling's mutual .
you might know everything i'm going to do , but i know everything you're going to do too !
it's a strange feeling !
sonic , you're still alive?
sonic , what's wrong with you?
you pervert !
get away , you little piece of tin !
i get it , you synchronized yourself with metal .
this is my chance !
sarah !
sonic !
oh no , my sarah !
that was close !
knuckles !
sonic !
you're a perfect target for me now , fox !
ready , aim ...
fire eggman missiles !
gotcha !
oh no , another design failure !
that's all right .
more importantly , what happened to sarah?
oh man , i can't stop !
you saved me !
thank you , mr. mole !
somebody stop me please !
i have more power than i thought i did !
there you are sarah .
it's time for you to come with me now .
look out !
tails !
sorry !
tails , i didn't think you'd stoop that low .
look , it's metal !
sonic !
stop it , metal !
if that ice bridge is destroyed , then that's it for all of us !
knuckles , see what you can do about the magma !
well ...
come on , you're a real man , aren't you?
right !
here we go !
you're totally cool , mr. mole !
good job , knuckles !
you stopped it !
my hat's on fire !
hot !
hot !
sonic !
what do you think you're doing?
why is this stupid thing that looks like sonic causing so much trouble?
oh , that's right !
i hope this works !
no !
if you destroy the land of the sky , then i'll have to marry eggman !
take that !
and that !
and that !
come on !
got it !
now , sonic !
sonic !
good work , tails !
you saved us !
who is that?
it doesn't look like eggman .
that's papa's rocket !
what did you say?
what?
is the door stuck?
we're in trouble !
the heat from the lava could cause it to explode !
sarah , you wait here .
come on , let's go !
papa !
of all the pointless stunts ...
i know .
if that thing explodes right there , we'll all be in trouble .
sonic !
get out of my way , metal !
darn !
sonic !
i'll take care of eggman , and you get the president out of there !
eggman !
trying to overload him by making him assimilate sonic's personality?
lmpressive , tails .
but you're too late .
metal , destroy sonic !
hurry !
hurry !
i know !
shut up !
oh no !
papa !
mr. president !
old man !
sonic !
sonic , are you all right?
metal?
don't do it , sonic !
what are you doing?
sonic !
grab onto my hand !
don't do it , sonic !
he'll drag you under with him !
there is only one sonic ...
metal !
don't do it , sonic !
metal !
come on , don't look so sad , sonic .
it's not like you at all .
she's right !
it was thanks to you that the planet was saved !
eggman !
you're all fools !
i still have all of sonic's data !
next time , i'll build a stronger metal that won't have sonic's personality .
and then i , eggman , will finally take over the entire planet !
it must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as eggman !
what are you doing?
stop !
it's finally over .
thank goodness everything's all right !
almost , but not quite .
what did you do that for?
so now we're finally even , sonic .
what do you mean?
come back , knuckles !
hey , sonic , wait up !
why'd you hit me?
i was getting you back for stepping on my head !
i don't remember doing that !
you did !
i don't remember !
not so fast !
you're not going to get away from me !
i'll get your data again , sonic !
what?
what?
what are you doing , eggman?
hurry up and catch sonic !
of course i will !
hang on !
wait , come back !
marry me !
sonic !
sonic , i'll get your data again !
i'm getting out of here !
i'll see you later , knuckles !
hey , wait up , sonic !
