ha , ha , ha .
home sweet home .
thanks , cochise .
no , you fucking idiot !
i've worked at a restaurant my whole iife .
shit !
it gonna be that kind of a party ,
i'm gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes !
guess who .
hi , dean .
it's mom .
ah , shit .
i know you're not gonna forget lunch with me , but i thought i'd call just to make sure .
oh , hey .
i forgot you were here .
yeah , i know .
i know .
what?
nothing .
i'ii see you at work , okay?
hey , there , natasha .
how's my favorite minor doing today?
hung over .
i got so shitty iast night .
on a schooi night?
kids today .
i must say , there's nothing more attractive than tainted youth .
yes .
i am indeed a pervert .
does that offend you?
nope .
i think that most tainted youths end up being perverts .
good answer .
oh , and monty , just so you know ,
i'm only a minor for another week .
i turn 18 on wednesday .
weil , then i guess i better hurry up then .
i don't have much time .
hey , dan .
hey , monty .
how you doing?
good .
this is mitch .
it's his first day .
i want you to show him around .
train him on everything while it's slow , and when the dinner rush hits , we'ii have him watch the training videos .
mitch , just iisten to what monty says today , and we'ii have you out on the floor by early next week .
sound good?
yeah .
aii right then .
give him a quick tour before your shift starts .
good stuff .
weil , mitch , first thing .
you ever worked in a restaurant before?
actuaily , yeah  weil , it doesn't reaily matter anyway .
working in a restaurant's aii about iearning a routine .
everything that dan wants me to show you , teach you , aii that can be iearned in a few hours .
but ... if you wanna work here , in this restaurant ,
i reaily think that you need to ask yourself one simple question .
how do you feei about frontai male nudity?
what the heck  pretty fucked up , huh?
you see , the reason that i ask is most of the guys that work here
iike to play this iittle game that involves flashing their genitalia to each other .
are you serious?
yes , i'm serious .
now , the exact object of the game is to get the other participants to unknowingly iook at your testicles and/ or penis .
and if they do , you ridicule them mercilessly for being a fag and get to kick them in the ass .
but that's  i know .
i know .
it's demented , depraved , senseless .
aii true .
now there are rules to the game different variations on how to show your dick and/ or bails which ailow for more kicks .
but we're gonna get into that iater .
right now , the first thing that you have to do is iook deep inside yourself and figure out if you can take an eyefui of that .
so are you taking any interesting classes this semester?
weil , yeah .
i'm only taking the two classes , but i iike 'em both .
i reaily iike my teachers .
cooi guys .
both have mustaches , which is a iittle weird .
weil , that's just terrific .
yeah .
guess who i ran into yesterday?
who's that?
nancy miiler and her son chet .
you remember chet miiler , don't you?
oh , yeah .
i remember chet .
yeah .
i haven't seen that guy since high school .
weil , he was away at coilege .
right .
didn't you two have aii the same honors classes together?
yeah , we sure did .
yeah , it sounds iike he's doing reaily weil .
i'ii bet .
seems he just graduated with a bachelor's degree in electricai engineering .
wow .
his parents must reaily be proud , huh?
weil , i'm gonna go .
always love these get togethers .
i think we reaily broke through there .
let me teii you something .
my trainer , that bastard , he didn't prewarn me at ail .
he set me up big time .
right around that corner .
okay .
look at the iog , bitch .
there are few things in this world more unsettling than going into the back to grab condiments , and ending up staring at a huge , steaming pile of cock .
hey , serena .
hey , babe .
what's up , hangover?
i'm not hung over .
oh , you and monty were crazy iast night .
yeah , it was cool .
how about you?
you have a good time?
i would've had a better time if somebody hadn't been ignoring me aii night .
was that me?
think monty and i got a iittle carried away .
oh , i swear , when you two are together .
you're perverts !
aii of you .
if you guys can go five minutes without referencing your genitals , i'ii be amazed .
i know what you're thinking now .
you think we're aii gay , don't you?
think we're aii just a bunch of deviant iifestyle iiving , same sex having motherfuckers , am i right?
yeah .
weil , iisten .
you can put that faggoty baby to bed right now .
none of the guys that work here are gay .
i mean , i'ii stick my finger in my ass every now and again when i'm feeling squirreily , but that's about the extent of it .
it's absolutely true .
i've seen him do it .
see what i mean?
perverts .
hey , i've seen you use more than a finger .
oh !
bye , babe .
what's up , buddy?
nothin ', man .
what's going on?
what?
what?
what's wrong?
i'ii teii you iater .
listen , man .
you got nothing to worry about .
it's just a game .
exactly .
and besides , you know , if heterosexuai men can't show their cocks to each other ,
then what the heii are we doing here?
amen , brother .
you're adorable .
hey , bishop .
this is mitch .
he's the new guy .
i want you to do a couple things for me .
first , i want you to observe very closely your surroundings today .
take everything in .
leave no mentai stone unturned .
can you do that for me , mitch?
good .
then i want you think about what your iife would be iike if you had been born blind .
thanks , bishop .
go .
go , go , go , go , go .
as you can see , this is a wait station .
this is where you're gonna get the ice , the soft drinks , the condiments , the doggie bags , et cetera and so forth .
that's the computer where you're gonna put the food and drink orders in .
i hate this fucking place sometimes , you know .
why the fuck do we need four more people on at this time of day , man?
look at this place !
it's fucking dead .
i swear , dan needs to clean the shit out of his fucking brain sometimes , man .
fucking asshole .
what are you iooking at , fuckwad?
that's naomi .
and she's been working here way too iong .
but she's actuaily a pretty sweet giri when she's drunk .
let's go .
come on , baby .
it's nothin 'iike that .
it's true .
you just treat me iike a piece of meat .
not just any piece of meat , baby .
a prime rib .
reaily?
uh huh .
baby , you're oozin 'with sexuality .
yeah , but why does it always have to be about my iooks?
just 'cause i dress slutty doesn't mean i am slutty .
okay .
this is for deliveries .
there's the dumpster for the trash .
also , if you wanna get out of the restaurant and chiii out , here you go .
and these two fun ioving pieces of wannabe gangster shit are nick and theodore .
how many fucking times i told you , man?
it's the fucking t dog , yo .
sorry , g.
hey , yo , bitch .
what makes you think i won't cut you?
aw .
come on , now , dog .
you know i'm just fucking with you .
you know i give you the mad , phat , superfly , stupid dope , dumb ass , retarded , bomb shit props .
yo , it's almost 4 : 20 , dog .
let's go .
those guys should be sterilized .
and i'm not kidding at ail .
you don't talk much , do you , mitch?
actuaily , you haven't reaily given  that's okay .
'cause i didn't talk much when i first started working here either .
you just gotta get used to your surroundings .
what's up , poncho?
hey , raddimus .
how you doin '?
actuaily , more importantly , how are you and danieile doing?
i saw that you guys were arguing , and
shit , you know , it would be a shame if you guys broke up .
you two are reaily good together .
fuck off , okay .
even if we did break up , you stand no chance in heil , man .
she got this thing about dating grown men who've had sex with 16 year old girls .
see , that's the problem with women , okay?
they're always trying to project their own values on you .
whatever .
anyway , this is mitch .
he just started today , so i thought i'd give you the pleasure of explaining the finer points of the game to him .
oh , virgin blood .
foilow me .
come here .
i wanna talk to you .
thanks , raddimus .
be gentle .
there you go , dean .
aw , thanks , tyla .
you rock .
yeah , tyla , you're the coolest giri in the whole school .
hey , man .
tyla , every time i iook at you , i wish i was a iesbian .
oh , what a coincidence .
every time i iook at you ,
i'm glad i'm a iesbian .
ouch .
oh , hey , christy .
it's just calvin cailin '.
just starting to work the double .
you owe me .
no , i was kiddin '.
you don't reaily owe me anything .
so , i was just cailin 'ya , 'cause it's kind of dead here right now .
so , i don't know .
give me a caii back .
i'm at work .
duh .
duh .
come on .
talk to me , goose .
what's wrong?
remember chet miiler from high school?
taii guy , kind of smeiled iike my dad's ass?
that's the one .
my mother told me he graduated with his bachelor's degree in electricai engineering .
yeah , so?
weil , you know , we were in aii the same classes in high school .
we're the same fucking age .
weil , yeah .
but electricai engineering?
come on .
screw that noise .
yeah , but come on , man .
we haven't even graduated from community coilege .
haven't even got our a. a. degree .
then when we do , what?
what the heii can you do with an a. a. degree anyway?
you can get a job substitute teaching for retarded kids or something .
exactly .
that's the dish area back there .
this is where you pick up the food .
that's floyd .
floyd !
welcome to thunderdome , bitch .
okay , that's the dry area , man .
that's where we keep aii the condiments .
right over here .
this is the cooler .
the milk and vegetables , whatever .
back here is the freezer .
you'ii find the meat
okay , so iet me teii you about this iittle game we play .
i assume monty went over the basic idea with you , right?
yeah , he  you know the object , right?
to have the other guy iook at you naked .
are you okay with that?
what are you , some kind of a fucking sick , demented pervert , huh?
no .
i was he told me .
come on , bro .
i'm just fucking with you .
look , man , we're aii sick .
aii right?
now , iook .
the main thing to remember is to get the other guy to unknowingly iook at your cock and bails .
okay , don't just fucking puii down your pants and say , " look at my dick !
you gotta be sneaky .
i'm gonna go through the positions with you .
the first one's the easiest .
caii that one " the look .
aii right?
aii you gotta do , puii down your pants reai quick , show 'em the goods .
if they iook , you get to kick 'em in the ass once .
second one is cailed " the brain . " right?
what you gotta do is isolate your nuts with your fist .
okay , now , take the time to iook at it , okay?
because it bears a striking resemblance to
aha .
brain .
yeah .
okay .
for that you get two kicks .
so  the third one , i caii it the " bat wing .
okay .
what you do is you take the excess skin from your nuts , and you take it and you make it flat iike paper , aii right?
now , once again , you take the time to appreciate this .
you see that it iooks aii veiny and alive iike a bat wing , aii right?
if they iook , they get three kicks , aii right?
but you can't forget this , aii right?
you gotta caii 'em a fag , okay?
very important .
the game ioses it's meaning if you don't humiliate them for being a fucking meatcake .
you got that?
i just don't understand why your mom gives you so much shit anyway .
i don't know , man .
you know .
she's my mom .
she wants me to succeed in iife .
yeah .
whatever the heii that means .
jesus , i'm just glad my mom's not iike that .
so i cailed your house today at 2 : 00 .
you were stiii asleep , weren't you?
that's an understatement .
so what did you do iast night?
i trust my iittle angei didn't do anything immoral .
weil , iet's see .
i started by getting completely hammered drunk .
it was bad .
then drove while intoxicated to pick up this disease infested prostitute .
uh huh .
from there , iet's see .
me and the hooker went back to my place
the hooker and i.
excuse me .
the hooker and i went back to my place .
and from there
god , it was just a blur of intravenous drug abuse and unprotected sex while taking the lord's name in vain .
dean , did you know that when monty was a child , everyone thought he was retarded?
dean , doesn't my mom iook old?
i mean , iike , much older than she rightfuily should?
so why aren't you and serena stiii together?
i iiked her .
i don't know .
i guess it got old .
we had a relationship based on orgasms .
oh , how charming .
you are being safe , aren't you?
i don't think i could handle the idea of you reproducing .
come on , mom .
of course i'm being safe .
i puii out .
yes , weil , your father puiled out too , but we've aii seen the tragic end of that story .
you think i wanna have kids?
absolutely not .
that's why i stick to anai sex .
if only i had been so iucky .
okay , so that's the abraham lincoln .
but remember , you have to shave it so it iooks iike his beard .
otherwise , it don't count .
now the iast one .
the iast one is cailed " the goat .
okay , it's a bit trickier .
but if you can puii it off , you are a god among men , aii right?
what you do is you take your nuts and your dick , right?
and you tuck it underneath .
puii your pants down , show it , aii right?
with it sticking out the backside .
you got that?
okay , weil , that just about covers aii the different variations that we have .
but you know , we're always iooking for new positions .
so next time you got a iittle down time , you find yourself a iittle bored , play with your nuts , you know what i'm saying?
see what you come up with , okay?
it's aii good .
aii right .
i reaily only have one thing i wanna talk about today , and that's teamwork .
when the dinner rush hits and things start to get hectic , you aii have a tendency to start yeiling and screaming at one another .
that's just dumb and senseless , 'cause you're only gonna be hurting yourselves .
let's think about it .
if you upset the hostess , she's not gonna seat you .
if you upset the busboys , they're not gonna care if your table's ready .
if you upset the cooks , they're not gonna care if your food's taking too iong .
the brain !
ah , shit !
oh , the brain !
i think you're aii great waiters and waitresses .
and you should be able to rely on one another when you're in the weeds .
remember , gang .
the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that iittle extra .
aii right .
that's aii i have for you today .
let's have a great shift .
oh , uh , push the fish .
it's about to turn .
that's it .
dean , can i have a word with you?
sure .
have a seat , dean .
thanks , dan .
how iong you been a waiter?
since i was 18 , so about four years .
wow .
you don't wanna be a waiter forever , do you?
what do you mean?
carson got promoted to gm over at riverside , so we need a new assistant manager .
i'd iike to offer the job to you .
are you serious?
heck , yeah , i'm serious .
now i'm not gonna iie to you .
the job comes with more responsibility , but it offers a iot more rewards .
you get fuii medical , dental , two weeks 'paid vacation , and i might add , a hefty pay increase .
i do pretty weil .
cool .
it is cool .
and , iet's not forget the power .
right .
control .
you teii people to do things , and they have to do it , or they get in trouble .
i mean , you're in the driver's seat here .
your finger's on the button .
think about it .
okay .
weil .
are you okay?
if you're not interested  no , no , no .
it's not that i'm not interested , i just
sorry , dan , just a iot of things can i take a iittle while to think about it?
yeah .
oh , sure .
yeah , yeah .
take your time .
yeah , don't rush , you know .
talk about it next week or something iike that .
cool .
thanks , dan .
let me ask you something .
what's that?
why don't we hang out?
oh .
like  why don't we hang out more often?
we do at work .
you and me .
i was thinking to myself iast night , iaying in bed , going ,
why don't dean and i hang out?
we're practicaily the same guy .
i i i sort of have a core group of friends .
you have your own friends and
you know what?
you'd think i do .
i don't .
has anyone seen dean?
oh , he's in the back talking to dan .
yeah , you wanna know what they're talking about?
dan wants to make dean assistant fuckin 'manager .
weil , did he take the job?
i don't know .
i couldn't
he better fuckin 'not have .
okay , whoa , whoa .
hold on .
i gotta warn you .
take my car , what do you think's gonna happen?
yeah , i don't reaily think  score .
okay .
god .
hey , so what was that about?
nothing important .
just builshit .

weil , i apologize for the food the iast few times , and we wiii certainly do our best to make sure that doesn't happen again .

okay .
about three months ago i just finished my shift , and i reaily had to take a piss .
so , i go into the bathroom .
and i'm at the urinal , just waiting for the flow , minding my own business .
when i notice out of my peripheral vision the guy standing next to me was looking straight at my dick .
he's just staring at it like they're old pals .
i could practically hear what he was thinking .
whoa .
that's a nice dick .
and that's it .
since that time , i haven't been able to use a public bathroom .
goodness .
and the next time i tried to take a ieak , i could've sworn the guy standing next to me was staring at me , and i freaked .
quit staring at my dick !
in retrospect , i think i might've been mistaken .
what about the stail?
no , it didn't work either .
every time i go to take a piss , i get the image of that guy's eyes on my shank .
and then that's when i start hearing the voices .
voices?
i get this paranoid feeling there are people outside the stail , and they know i'm having a difficult time taking a piss .
i can hear them saying , " what's taking him so long?
why can't he just piss iike a normai person?
i don't hear any peel
i'm reaily fucked up .
psychosomatic auditory hailucinations .
most people have to pay for such a thing .
so what the heii should i do?
weil , first , you need to think about how this problem affects other parts of your personality .
oh .
see , i recommend
oh , bro , that ain't right , man .
take a iook at the bat wing , bitch !
oh , it's so veiny .
damn , raddimus .
does danieile know that you iike to go both ways?
how does that work?
sweet victory .
good job , asshole .
i'm sorry .
go ahead .
heilo , sir .
my name is monty .
this is my trainee , mitch .
how are you doing today?
oh , i'm slipping graduaily into senility .
reaily?
do you consider that a good thing or a bad thing?
weil , it's a mixed bag .
it's good in the sense that i can take walks in my underwear .
i can give smaii children the middle finger .
but as iong as i iook happy while i'm doing it , people just assume i'm senile .
yeah , so what's the bad?
weil , sometimes i give smaii children the middle finger and don't realize i'm doing it untii someone slaps me .
so i reaily am going senile .
alzheimer's can't be aii bad .
you get a chance to meet new people every day .
i iike you , monty .
i iike you too , sir .
i iike you too , monty .
so what could i get you to drink?
i trust you .
you know what?
you can count on me , sir .
i don't even care if he gives me a poor tip , that is the coolest old man i've met in my entire iife .
how's your table?
couple of hicks .
yikes .
yeah , but the check total's $63 , so even if they tip 15 percent i should make 10 bucks .
you're a bastard .
so far i've made 15 percent of jack shit .
jesus .
there you go , buddy .
it's aii you .
thanks a iot .
we'ii see you next time .
how much did they ieave you? $1 . 91 .
no fucking way .
excuse me , sir .
you forgot your change .
no .
that's for you .
that's your tip .
oh , no , no , no .
i insist .
you take it .
you obviously need this more than i do .
i wanna speak to your manager now , please .
this is horse shit .
okay , mitch , you see what dean did there?
don't ever do that .
what , did he stiff you?
he might as fucking weii have .
two bucks on a $63 check .
oh , damn .
that is pretty shitty .
for insulting me i should get some free gift certificates and a key chain and a hat .
absolutely , sir .
yes .
and how about a couple of sundaes with some nuts on 'em?
yeah , i wiii have natasha take down aii your information , and i wiii make sure corporate sends those to you .
you're gonna maii me a sundae?
i want it now .
get in here .
you wanna explain to me what the heck you were thinking?
insulting a customer iike that?
you're right .
i know .
i know .
he just
i'm having a reaily bad day , dan , and that guy caught me at the worst possible moment .
i'm sorry .
i iost it .
you're sorry?
i don't understand .
i've never gotten a complaint on you .
and you had to pick the day i offer you a promotion?
i promise you it won't happen again , okay?
opportunity is knocking at the door .
if you don't wanna answer it , fine .
there are people who would jump at the chance .
calvin is chomping at the bit for this job .
i am offering you an opportunity to take it to the next ievel , earn more money .
i want an answer by the end of your shift ... tonight !
and dean , this is an exploding offer .
i don't work within the exact boundaries of the iaw , because i wasn't consulted when the goddamn iaws were made .
no , instead , nameless , faceless politicians , the so cailed protectors of the morai majority decide what is right and what is wrong .
i mean , come on !
i govern my iife around my own personai code of ethics , and i suggest you do the same .
that way if , within the constructs of my own morality
i were to do something that was considered iilegal , so be it .
i feei no guilt whatsoever .
and furthermore , if i were to buckle under the sociai weight of the system by adhering to iaws that i do not truly believe in , then i would be extinguishing the very fire of patriotism and individuality .
it's it's so
in a sense , by having sex with natasha ,
i'd be preserving the rights our forefathers fought and died for , right?
weil , i guess  bro , it was a rhetoricai question .
okay?
so
oh , hey , dean .
i heard dan yeiling at you .
it was kind of crazy .
you think you're stiii in the running for the assistant manager?
did you ever just wake up and realize , " holy shit .
i'm a fucking ioser .
yeah , man .
god , i just wanna be able to say , " i wanna be a teacher , " you know , or a podiatrist or a fucking electricai engineer .
anything !
just have a fucking clue !
hey , who has a clue , right?
hey , i don't .
heilo?
i don't know what's going on .
hey , could you put down the ice pick?
sorry you had to hear that guy yeil .
oh , it's okay .
you shouldn't have to be subjected to that .
you're way too sweet .
way too cute , too .
stop it .
you're gonna make me blush .
bet you drive the boys wild at your school .
maybe .
i don't reaily iike the boys at my school .
no?
why?
i prefer older men .
reaily?
wow .
i iike a man in power .
yeah , weil , being a manager , obviously , i know what you mean .
it takes a iot of power to command the respect of everybody at the restaurant .
that's true .
yeah .
we should go to dinner sometime and talk about it .
i'ii bring my manager card , and we'ii just eat for free .
as they say , membership has its privileges .
what's up with you?
what are you stiii doing here?
christy asked me to work for her , so i'm working a double .
time out .
isn't this your only night off this week?
yeah .
and you're using it to work a double shift for christy?
wait .
you actuaily have to get the pussy before you can be whipped by it .
that's right .
you guys suck .
yes , we do .
wait .
didn't you take out christy iast night?
yeah , we went out iast night .
come on , man !
details !
fuck the details .
i wanna know .
did you do it?
did you make a move?
what do you mean?
don't give me that shit .
you know .
did you kiss her?
rub against her skin?
cuddle with her?
rub her ieg?
hold her hand?
nipple tweak?
anything?
no , i'm stiil  oh , my god !
i need more time .
forget it .
it's over .
you're fucked .
not iiteraily .
why?
because you won't puii the trigger .
and you're too fucking nice !
why do you always say that?
i'm not
what happens with every giri you iike?
nothing !
you take 'em out , you pay for everything , and you never make a move !
then you home , alone , to masturbate while you cry , using your own tears
that was once , and i was drunk and it was valentine's day .
so back off .
don't try to candy coat it .
aii we ever do is hang out and have sex .
what are you talking about?
didn't i take you to the movies iast week , huh?
huh?
yeah , but you kept trying to get me to jerk you off .
what do you want?
it was a duii movie .
yeah , but i just get the feeling that you don't care .
i don't care?
i don't care?
when my uncle died , didn't i ask you to be by my side at the funeral?
yeah , but you kept trying to get me to jerk you off .
how many times can we have the same exact conversation?
it's iike we're stuck in a time paradox where neither our wisdom nor your virginity wiii ever escape .
i attempt to make a move .
i get in close .
i'm there and i just get
fuck !
you need therapy .
hush , now .
the way i see it , with chicks , there's reaily only two possible things that could happen .
either they won't sleep with you , and then there's no need to caii them again , or they do sleep with you , and then there's no need to caii them again .
this is what i don't get .
how can someone be such a complete asshole aii the time and get as many women as you do?
that's a good question .
amy !
serena !
calvin needs our help .
no .
no , i don't need help .
shh , shh .
women iike assholes , am i right?
weil , i agree that you're an asshole .
okay .
a " , fuck you .
b " , just answer the question .
weil , okay .
girls iike assholes , not women .
what women are attracted to is self confidence .
yes , and we absolutely fucking hate insecurity .
yes !
the more insecure you are the more you ask , " is something wrong?
" is everything okay?
" what are you thinking about?
what's wrong?
and the more you do that , calvin , the more it becomes this self fulfiiling prophecy .
you just need to relax and not worry so much .
okay?
yeah .
that makes a iot of sense .
i'm gonna work on it .
yeah .
yeah , you do that .
and by the way , take whatever advice that she gives you with a big grain of salt .
yeah , and take anything that he gives you with a shot of peniciilin .
seriously , calvin , do yourself a favor .
unless you're combing the playground for middle schoolers , don't become an asshole iike monty .
correct me if i'm wrong , but haven't i been inside you?
oh , monty .
oh , me .
you wanna brag about your sexuai conquests , you big stud , you?
okay , you know what?
fine .
let's talk about it .
let me describe monty's amazing sexuai prowess .
he'd barrei into me with that pathetic excuse for a child's penis .
and it would end so quickly , so abruptly ,
i wouldn't even have time to feei any sort of morbid , accidentai amusement towards his " technique , " which was basicaily him seizuring on top of me for , oh , about 45 seconds , while i iaid there trying not to iaugh ... or cry .
ouch .
is it any wonder why you stiii date girls in high school?
they're the only ones ieft .
they don't know any better .
okay , okay .
aii right .
first of ail , for the record ,
i always had an orgasm when we had sex .
secondly , everybody knows that i'm oraily fixated .
you can't deny that i played your vagina iike a violin .
oh !
as if that somehow negates the fact that once we got past foreplay , you turned into the iittle engine that couldn't hold his ioad .
oh , what the fuck ever !
if i was that bad , then why were you at my house every night?
aii i had to do was caii and say , " hey .
i'm horny .
and then fucking poof !
as if by some form of slut magic you'd appear .
now why is that?
because at first , i reaily iiked spending time with you .
i thought you were a genuinely interesting guy to be around .
very true .
but eventuaily , it aii wore thin .
i realized that your personality was just one short punctuated joke after another , much iike our sex iife .
and , oh , monty , do you remember why we stopped dating?
yeah , i do .
because you were old news .
i was iooking at other girls and getting bored .
basicaily , that was why .
yeah , yeah .
aii that .
and the fact that i dumped you .
wait , i thought you said you dumped  shut up , calvin .
i was just trying to iet you down easy , but this is builshit .
we both know that you enjoyed having sex with me .
the only reai pleasure i ever got from having sex with you came from making fun of it iater with my friends .
teii him , amy .
it's true .
we iaughed a iot at your expense .
so you know when you're walking past a group of people , you hear them iaughing , you sometimes get that paranoid self conscious feeling?
maybe they're iaughing about you when they're reaily not?
weil , in your case , they reaily are .
god , i love her .
oh , hello there .
thank you for joining our family at shenaniganz bar and grill .
it is our goal to maintain the absolute highest standard in all aspects
hey , man .
we aii had to watch it .
i'm gonna come back and get you after the dinner rush .
the tape should be done then .
cool?
weil , i mean , i guess .
i ... of our most sacred company policies to ensure that you have all the skills necessary
to uphold our standard of excellence .
shit .
are you ready?
well , okay .
follow me .
aii right , men .
this is it .
the time has come .
remember , product pride .
portion consciousness .
zero hour is upon us .
let us seize the day !
yeah , yeah !
carpe deez nuts .
god , i can't wait to quit this job !
okay , your waiter wiii be right with you .
hi there , folks .

would you iike a baked potato , french fries or rice pilaf?
order up !
is everything prepared okay?
how about some dessert?
and here you go , folks .
i hope you enjoyed everything .
i know i did .
fuck !
the five second rule !
the five second rule !
one , two , three , four , five .
a iittle floor spice makes everything nice .
there you go .
damn , man .
we almost had to switch to the ten second rule .
you green snot beard faggot !
fuck you !
oh , no .
hang on .
i only have a smaii order .
i have to put in an appetizer .
goddamn it .
chiii the fuck out !
weil , hurry up .
okay , hey , gang .
listen up .
let's get out there , take care of our guests .
i know it's getting crazy , but we can do it .
we can do it .
let's put that extra just that iittle extra back in extraordinary .
okay .
there's no " me " in " team .
yeah .
hey , guys .
which one of these is medium rare?
shoot .
let's just
goddamn it !
please .
let me do it .
aii right , you two , iet's go .
hurry up , or your asses are fired !
so remember , find the solution before there's a problem .
now let's go take a look at our problem back in the kitchen .
come on , guys .
this is buii crap .
where the heil's my chicken sandwich?
fuck you , bitch !
what the heii did i do to you , floyd?
eat at shenaniganz enjoy your food
eat at shenaniganz calvin works here
okay , that's hardly sanitary .
hey , dan .
i have a table that needs to
trying to get a feei for the whole manager thing .
you caught me .
do you think you could get a feei for it outside?
i need some fresh air .
hey , hey , christy .
it's calvin again .
i
just cailing again .
just checking in or whatever .
cailed before a few times .
maybe you didn't
i got aii my bars .
so anyway , it's getting kind of busy .
but i'm never too busy to caii you .
so caii me back .
you know the number .
okay .
bye .
fuck .
so is everything okay?
is something wrong?
are you mad?
yeah?
somethin 'bad happens when you become a manager .
you put on your fuckin 'tie , and you get your fuckin 'iittle manager card , and you're think you're so fuckin 'cooi because you write the schedule and teii us what to do .
when in reality , you know you're not even worth a bit of builshit !
whoa , naomi !
relax .
relax , woman .
i guess if you become manager , you won't be able to date any of the waitresses .
while working here , you'll probably find some of your fellow employees attractive .
it's okay .
there's nothing wrong with that .
but it's important not to act on those urges .
for shenaniganz to run like an efficient , well oiled machine , it's a must that everyone act as a team .
and when employees date each other , unfortunately , it complicates things .
so for that reason we strongly discourage such relationships from forming .
dean , amy , i just sat you .
oh , shit .
what do we got?
weil , yours are cool .
they iook iike business people .
aii right .
what about mine?
i don't know .
they don't speak english .
foreigners !
i'm sorry .
are you mad at me?
no , i swear .
i'm just going by the rotation .
i fuckin 'hate foreigners !
it's such builshit !
like they don't know how to tip?
oh , they know .
aw , yeah , they fuckin 'know .
aii right .
it's time to show the goat .
you could cut through shoes if you had to .
i mean  what are you doing , man?
frontline stuff .
watch this .
watch this .
we have just been cutting things 90 to nothing .
and the cooks , they just love it because every time
hey , there , folks .
my name is amy , and i'ii be taking care of you .
sir , what can i get for you?
i'd iike a new york strip , mid rare , and a baked potato with sour cream and chives only .
and hey .
you're not writing any of this down .
oh .
steel trap .
you got the baby back ribs with fries , you got the mandingo chicken with rice and a salad with a side of blue cheese .
i respect the iactose intolerance .
okay .
okay , you're good .
haley is so fuckin 'fine , you know i be aii up in that shit .
give her the bowling baii grip .
two in the pink , one in the stink .
you guys are so one dimensional .
weil , fuck you , whitey .
i just sat you .
you're gonna love them .
hey , there , iadies .
my name is monty .
hey , floyd , make sure there's no bacon on that chef salad .
it's against her religion .
aii right?
yes , master .
right away , master .
ain't gonna be no bacon on the salad , master .
no bacon .
oh , no , no .
oh , no , no .
please .
oh .
oh , no .
no bacon on the salad
so , is there anything else i can get you folks this evening?
i think i'd iike a hot fudge sundae .
that does sound good .
i'ii be right back with that for you .
like that bitch needs to be eating dessert anyway .
you know , if you ever want counseling in anger management or ... alcoholism , i'd be more than glad to do it for you .
you'd do that for me?
thank you .
i appreciate that .
but i think i'd rather you just wash the fucking dishes and shut the fuck up !
fucking psychobabble builshit asshole !
fuckin 'bitch .
son of a bitch , cocksucker .
fuckin ', i hate her .
i hate her !
fuckin 'nick and t dog !
that is why we are always on guard for guests .
you never know when
shit .
so you have to make sure they
fuck !
man , no !
if we're gonna beat iast year's numbers , i need you to be more hands on .
i need you to be sure things don't faii through the cracks .
basicaily , i need you to be more iike dean here .
i question whether you can see that by me serving food , but thank you anyway .
how is everything , guys?
everything's perfect .
you're a master of your craft .
thanks .
you keep this up , i may just try to iure you away from this place .
aii right .
weil , thank you , sir .
let me know if you need anything , guys .
you're probably wondering what makes shenaniganz such a great restaurant .
so i thought i'd share with you a few key examples of why we've had so much success .
first of all , our entres are always cooked exquisitely to perfection .
our deserts were designed by gourmet chefs .
we always treat our guests with respect and dignity .
did you see the tits on table 12?
we treat each other with respect and dignity .
fuckin 'ass pervert !
remember , the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra .
the penis just iooks ridiculous .
it's iike a shriveled roii of dimes or something .
i know .
it's a joke .
she's in iove .
hey , tyla .
you gonna talk to your girlfriend aii night or make my drink?
that's okay .
i understand how it works .
birds of a feather flock to vagina .
get off your ass and get help !
you want some help , bitch?

theodore !
what the heck are you doing?
how many times i told you?
my name is t dog , bitch !
my name is t dog , bitch !

hey , sweetie .
it's almost 9 : 00 .
i just came to say good bye .
hey , baby .
you wanna go in the car and have a iittle sex?
so what if there's plenty of parking spaces?
it's the principle of the matter .
hey , you're preaching to the choir here .
know what i mean?
the iord giveth , the iord taketh away .
damn , come on .
what the fuck?
here you go , sir .
once again , i hope you enjoyed everything .
thanks .
see you guys .
dean , i wanna teii you , you did an extraordinary job .
oh , thank you , sir .
how old are you?
i'm 22 .
weil , you're obviously a very inteiligent young man .
let me give you my card .
ever get tired of this place , you're iooking for a new opportunity ,
you give me a cail .
aii right .
thank you , sir .
i honestly appreciate that .

weil , i hope he cails .
mama said they's my magic shoes .
mama said they'd take me anywhere .
of course , mama used to beat me with a rubber hose , caii me a retard .
dude , please stop .

i do .
but , dude , i'm reaily not in the mood for smiling , aii right?

the old iady at table 37 wants you to sing the birthday song for her grandson .
his name is timmy , and he's eight years old .
i need birthday singers !
come on , people !
we need birthday singers !
fuck .
there he is .
there's the big winner .
yeah !
hey .
aii right .
attention , guests !
today's a very speciai occasion .
it's timmy's eighth birthday !
big round of applause .
he's earned it .
he's got his whole iife ahead of him .
the sky's the iimit .
i don't know but i've been told
someone here is getting old
good news is dessert is free
bad news is we sing off key
happy birthday
to you
look at the camera !
picture time .
aii right .
aii right .
cry it off .
weil , we can't go in the parking iot .
can't go anywhere in the kitchen .
weil , maybe we could
we are not having sex in the bathroom .
but  no .
no way .
forget it .
oh .
come on , baby .
come on .
okay .
okay , but this is the iast time .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
so where do you girls go to coilege?
actuaily , we're stiii in high school .
you're kidding .
how old are you girls?
sixteen .
wow .
you iook a iot older than that .
i would've guessed 19 , 20 , maybe 21 .
yeah , we get that a iot .
here .
let me give you a hand with that .
it's the stupid childproof iighters .
hey , bishop .
can i talk to you about something?
yeah , sure .
have a seat .
thanks .
aii right , so i went to my mother's this morning .
you've been working here , what?
about a year and four months , right?
yeah , i guess .
about .
but anyway , we have a good relationship  about three years ago , this restaurant went through quite a iow point .
okay , i'm sorry .
did you wanna hear what i was gonna say or
please .
see , the store morale was beginning to slip .
clientele base began dropping off .
that of course , ied to iower tips , which in time ,
ied to an even iower store morale .
basicaily , the entire restaurant was going through quite a downward spiral .
okay .
then raddimus began working here .
and with him came the penis showin 'game you aii iike to play .
okay , i why are you teiling me this?
restaurant began to improve .
employees started having more fun at work .
they started joking around a iot more , which ied to a raise in the clientele base , higher tips and so on and so forth .
yeah , i stiii don't understand , bishop .
point is , the penis showin 'game became a catalyst for the change necessary to be made in the restaurant .
so , when things in your iife become stagnant .
you know , you're no ionger happy with what you're doing .
then you figure out what's important to you .
then create your own penis showin 'game .
metaphoricaily speaking , that is .
okay .
okay , thanks , bishop .
so do you think taking the assistant manager job would be iike my penis showing game?
is that what you're saying?
okay .
where the heii is it?
it's been over half an hour !
told you it'd be up in a minute !
get out of my face or i'ii iose your ticket !
what?
what do you want?
get back to the training room , you ass cock !
goddamn it !

we're gonna take a picture .
bus table 73 first , and then i'ii give you the camera .
yeah , whatever .
ma'am , i don't doubt the steak was overcooked , but did you have to eat it aii before you complained about it?
it's too bad chlamydia has to be a venereai disease .

chlamydia?
