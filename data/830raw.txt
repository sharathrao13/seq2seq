thank you very much and welcome to to tell the truth .
our first guest , he's made a career out of being the most outrageous impostor that we've ever come across on this show and you're going to see what i mean .
number one what is your name , please?
my name is frank william abagnale .
number two?
my name is frank william abagnale .
number three?
my name is frank william abagnale .
from 1964 to 1967
i successfully impersonated
an airline pilot for pan am airways
and i flew over two million miles for free .
during that time , i was also the chief resident pediatrician
at a georgia hospital
and an assistant attorney general
for the state of louisiana .
by the time i was caught , i was considered
the youngest and most daring con man in u. s . history .
i had cashed almost $4 million in fraudulent checks
in 26 foreign countries and all 50 states .
and i did it all before my 19th birthday .
my name is frank william abagnale .

number one , why , with all your talent ... and you're obviously a very bright fellow ... why didn't you go in for a legitimate profession?

this is america , right?
i'm not a criminal .
i'm a medal of honor winner a lifetime member of the new rochelle rotary club .

yep .
didn't that bank turn you down for a loan , though?

what do they think , it's easy for a woman my age and all the money that it costs to travel?
i tell you , they don't give a damn .
mr. and mrs. abagnale this is not a question of your son's attendance .
i regret to inform you that , for the past week
frank has been teaching mrs. glasser's french class .
he what?
your son has been pretending to be a substitute teacher
lecturing the students , uh , giving out homework .
mrs. glasser has been ill and there was some confusion with the real sub .
your son held a teacher parent conference yesterday and was planning a class field trip to a french bread factory in trenton .
do you see the problem we have?
mrs. davenport?
yeah .
uh , i have a note to miss fifth and sixth period today .
doctor's appointment .
one moment .
i'll be right with you .
hey ...
yes?
you should fold it .
what?
that note .
it's a fake , right?
you should fold it .
it's ...
it's a note from my mom .
i have a doctor's appointment .
yeah , but there's no crease in the paper .
when your mom hands you a note to miss school the first thing you do is , you fold it and you put it in your pocket .
i mean , if it's real , where's the crease?
frankie .
ma , i'm home .
oh , you remember that girl joanna
i was telling you about?
i asked her out today .
think we're going to go to the junior prom .
ma , is this my driver's license?
that's all there is , two bedrooms .
oh , frankie .
you remember dad's friend?
jack barnes?
from the club .
hello .
he came by looking for your father .
i was giving him a tour of the apartment .
it's very , uh , uh , spacious , paula .
dad's at the store . so , frank ... you're getting to look more like your old man every day .
thanks for the sandwich , paula .
i'll see you later , eh?
wait .
is this yours?
oh .
well , thanks , frank .
uh , that's the president's pin .
i'd be in deep trouble if i lost that .
i'll see you all later , eh?
are you hungry , frankie?
i'll make you a sandwich .
jack wanted to talk business with your father .
he thinks we should get a lawyer and sue the government .
that is not legal , what they're doing to us .
why aren't you saying anything?
you're not going to tell him ... are you?
no .
that's right .
there's nothing to tell .
i'm going out for a few hours to visit some old friends from the tennis club and ... when i get home , we'll all have dinner together .
right?
but you won't say anything because it's ... it's just silly , isn't it?
how could we sue anybody?
oh ... do you need some money , frankie?
a few dollars to buy some record albums?
here , take five dollars .
or or ten .
you promised you were going to quit .
ma , i'm home !
hey , hey !
you ...
you stay away from me , hear me?
you stay away from me ...
i don't know who you are but if you ever come back here again ...
frankie !
frank , frank , calm down , will you?
i'm dick kesner .
now , i want you to leave your things here and follow me into the next room , okay?
they're all waiting for you .
you don't have to be scared .
i'm right here , frank .
i'll always be here .
but there are laws .
everything in this country has to be legal . so what we need to do is make some decisions .
that's what mr. kesner is here for .
many times these decisions are left up to the courts but that can be very expensive , frank people fighting over their children .
nobody is fighting .
look at me , frank .
nobody is fighting .
dad , what's going on?
dad , what's going on?
do you remember your grandma , eve? she arrived this morning .
hello .
do you understand what we're saying to you , frank?
your father and i are getting a divorce .
nothing's gonna change .
we're still gonna see each other . stop it , please , frank .
don't interrupt .
frank , you don't have to read all of this .
most of it's for your parents ... boring adult business ... but this paragraph right here , this is important because it states who you're gonna live with ... after the divorce ... whose custody you will be in .
and there's a blank space right here .
and i want you to go into the kitchen sit at the table and put a name down .
you can take as long as you want but when you come back into this room ...
i want to see a name on that line .
frank , just write down a name and this will all be over .
it's gonna be okay .
dad , what name?
your mother or your father .
just put the name there .
it's as simple as that .
and don't look so scared .
it's not a test .
there's no wrong answer .
hi .
one ticket to grand central , please .
that'll be $3 . 50 , sir .
is it okay if i write you a check?
carl , when do i get to call my father?
you can call him when we get to new york .
we leave for the airport in seven hours .
until then , just sit there .
be quiet .
you know , carl , on the other side of the hotel they got suites that face the park .
it's the best room the fbi can afford .
it's okay , i've stayed in worse .
mr. mudrick ...
mr. mudrick , please .
you have to listen .
i don't want to hear your story .
this is two checks that bounced .
you know how much trouble i'm in?
no , but listen , i'm telling you , the bank , they made the mistake .
i'll write you another check right now !
what , do i look like i was born yesterday?
look , it's midnight , mr. mudrick .
where am i gonna go?
you're a goddamn kid .

i mean , i hope you understand .
my boss sent me to brooklyn , then queens .
now he wants me in long island to take a few clients out for a night on the town .
i'm sorry , but we're not allowed to cash checks from other banks .

it's three years expired .
aw , thanks !
and what about your i. d. badge?

i've decided to become a pilot for pan american airways ... the most trusted name in the skies .

we won't have any cash until the banks open in an hour but , uh , i'm sure they can cash your check at the airport .

i love you , dad .
aloha , frank .
hello , deadhead .
hello .
enjoying your free ride?
marci ... did you drop this?
must've slipped right off your neck .
no ...
no !
no ...
yes , yes , yes , yes !
yes !
why are you stopping?
i want to tell you something , marci .
this is by far ... the best date i have ever been on .
i'd like to open a money market , please .
okay .
welcome to miami mutual bank .
how may i help you?
my name is frank taylor .
i'm a copilot for pan am .
i'd like to cash this check here , and then
i'd like to take you out for a steak dinner .
and then we feed the checks into the mlcr machine which uses special ink to encode the account numbers on the bottom of the checks .
and where are these numbers?
they're , um ... right here .
right there? see?
they're called routing numbers . so where do the checks get routed to?
you know , i don't exactly know .
nobody ever asked me that before .
our next item up for bid is also from the jersey central bank foreclosure .
this is a mlcr encoder a machine used to encode bank checks .
do i have an opening bid?
our unknown subject is a paperhanger who started working on the east coast .
in the last few weeks , this unsub has developed a new form of check fraud which i'm calling " the float .
what he's doing is he's opening checking accounts at various banks then changing the mlcr ink routing numbers at the bottom of those checks .
next slide , please .
next slide , please .
uh , the remote thing is broken .
you'll have to do it by hand .
you've gotta ... try the ...
agent mullen , it should be ... it should be the square button just there by the side .
this carousel doesn't work .
it's a bad carousel you got there .
thank you , agent mullen .
got to move it manually .
this is a map of the 12 banks of the u. s .
federal reserve . slide .
mlcr scanners at every bank read these numbers at the bottom of a check ... slide ... and then , ship that check off to its corresponding branch .
carl , for those of us who are unfamiliar with bank fraud you mind telling us what the hell you're talking about?
the east coast branches are numbered zero one to zero six .
the central branch is zero seven , zero eight so on , so forth .
you mean those numbers on the bottom of a check actually mean something?
all of this was in the report i filed two days ago .
if you change ... a zero two to a one two that means that check , which was cashed in new york does not go to the new york federal branch but it is rerouted all the way to the san francisco federal branch .
the bank doesn't even know the check has bounced for two weeks which means our unsub can stay in one place paper the same city over and over again while his checks circle the country .
you know , you want to talk to my wife . she's the one balances the checkbook at our house .
next slide .
daddy !
my son , the birdman . some uniform , frank .
what do you think?
nice . sit down .
so , dad ...
daddy , have you gotten the postcards?
of course .
this fork is ice cold .
no , no , dad , th that's a chilled salad fork .
it's a fancy restaurant , you know .
well , here ...

what's that?

you know what those are , right?
those are the keys to a 1965 cadillac deville convertible .
brand new , dad .
red with white interior split seats , air conditioning , the works .
are you giving me a cadillac?
yeah .
i'm giving you a cadillac .
dad , sh she's parked downstairs .
when we're done eating lunch why don't you , you know , drive on over to mom's house pick her up , take a little joyride?
do you know what would happen if the irs found out
i was driving around in a new coupe?
i took the train here , frank .
i'm taking the train home .
all right .
i have plenty of money .
you know , if you ever , ever need anything ...

hanratty , carl hanratty .
mind if i see some identification? sure .
you never can be too careful these days .

i read the report . six feet tall , brown hair , 27 to 30 years of age 160 pounds .
this could be almost anybody .
i heard his voice , sean , i saw his face .
there's nothing for him to hide behind anymore .
just be careful .
you got 12 years in .
nobody bothers you down on the first floor .
you practically wrote the book on bank fraud .
that's the kind of thing that can make you section chief someday .
just don't put yourself in this type of position .
what type of position?
position of being humiliated .
sean , would you like to hear me tell a joke?
yeah , sure .
knock , knock !

this skywayman's driving me crazy .

i couldn't do that . see , this check is for $1, 400 .
we agreed upon $1, 000 .
