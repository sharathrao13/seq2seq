so don't make any plans .
bravo !
after the war , i'll leave it with you .
you're very sweet .
the allies have landed in ltaly .
we can all go home then .
i can't believe it .
you really want this war to be over?
what is wrong with you ltalians?
we don't have your advantages , gunther .
advantages?
the advantage of thinking that ... other races are inferior to yours .
it's a question of science .
you can't alter a scientific fact .
i don't care about science .
it's morality that counts .
what is your morality?
lf i were to see a man ... being set upon by others ...
i would think that man was my brother .
that is my morality .
i would make myself believe it's personal .
for me , too , the war is personal .
i lost both my grandfathers in the great war .
a war that you started .
and my father's brother , two of my mother's brothers .
i grew up in a country where it was hard to survive .
we were hungry all the time .
all we ever knew about was defeat .
but now
sometimes it is better ... to lose than to have so much blood on your hands .
it's a beautiful night , and everything is peaceful ... and we should think about falling in love .
that's beautiful .
what is it?
it's " pelagia's song .
i wrote you that song because i love you .
i don't care if the world knows it .
i couldn't care less ... if i never pick up the mandolin again .
when i was playing , it felt like my hands were lumps of wood .
it felt as if every note was sour , stale .
and then i realised it's useless .
it's hopeless .
it can't begin to express the way i feel about you .
next time you see him ... tell him i have got his mandolin .
he left it in the square .
four more boys from the village have left to join mandras .
constantine's boys .
kostas's brother , what's his name?
george .
he's only fifteen .
he always worshipped mandras .
do you love him?
we are engaged to be married .
i am not talking about mandras .
when you fall in love ... it is a temporary madness .
it erupts like an earthquake , and then it subsides .
and when it subsides , you have to make a decision .
you have to work out whether your roots ... have become so entwined together ... that it is inconceivable ... that you should ever part .
because this is what love is .
love is not breathlessness .
it is not excitement .
it's not the desire to mate every second of the day .
it is not lying awake at night ... imagining that he is kissing every part of your body .
no , don't blush .
i'm telling you some truths .
that is just being in love ... which any of us can convince ourselves we are .
love itself is what is left over ... when being in love has burned away .
doesn't sound very exciting , does it?
but it is .
do you think that you could begin to imagine ... that that is how you will come to feel with captain corelli?
you must act honourably ... with respect to mandras and his mother .
and ... pray for the liberation of the island ... because then everything becomes possible .
drosoula .
all night i've been thinking about mandras .
about me and mandras .
thinking about how long we've been apart .
when did you arrive?
where is your ring?
my fingers got too thin .
i thought i would lose it .
where will you stay?
i want to ask you something .
we need to see the ltalian captain .
i want you to ask him to meet with us .
as soon as you can .
ln germany , the port of hamburg ... suffered a second day of continuous air raids ... from nearly 800 british aircraft ...
leaving much of the city in ruin .
while , in ltaly , rome has finally fallen ... to the allied advance after weeks of fierce fighting ... and a huge bombing campaign on the capital .
allied commandos ... are closely watching the mediterranean countries ... occupied by german and ltalian forces .
it's not yet clear what the german attitude ... to an ltalian withdrawal might be ... but germany will assume sole command ... of many strategic territories .
hitler is expected to send massive reinforcements ... through the balkans and into greece ... as the nazis struggle to maintain supply routes ... to northern africa .
mandras is back .
he wants to see you .
it's over !
it's all over !
mussolini has fallen !
we're going home !
colonel barge and i have agreed the date for the surrender ... of our heavy weapons and machine guns the fifteenth of september .
that's in five days time .
why should we lay down our arms?
they were our allies .
why should they be dictating terms to us?
we have surrendered .
mussolini has surrendered to the british and the americans ... not to the germans .
colonel barge and i have agreed .
lf we surrender our arms , do we have confirmation ... that they will not use force against us?
i have a personal undertaking ... from colonel barge and his officers ... that our troops will be allowed safe passage .
my men will never agree to return home ... without their weapons .
lf you surrender your arms in times of war ... then you are no longer a man .
lf you were in their position , if you were german ... you would want to be certain for your own security ... that the weapons will not be passed on ... to the allied forces or to the greek partisans .
or turned against you .
or turned against you .
you must be looking forward to going home .
there'll be people happy to see you again , i'm sure .
your family , your mother , your wife .
your girlfriend?
you wanted to see me?
we need arms .
machine guns , ammunition , land mines ... anything you can spare .
how can i give you weapons?
you know i can't do that .
you've surrendered .
lf you don't intend to fight ... you won't be needing your weapons .
we have a country to defend .
there is a massive buildup ... of german troops on the mainland .
the 1 1 7th jaeger division is nearing the corinth canal .
the 104th is moving south from yugoslavia .
then you are not in any position to resist .
unless we act now .
do you know , captain , on lefkada lsland ... all the ltalians who surrendered ... have been sent to prison camps in the north .
we heard they went home .
the trains were diverted in albania .
ln this war , captain ... it's hard to know who you can trust .
but one thing is certain you can't trust the germans .
last night i dreamed i was sitting ... in a restaurant in piazza navona ... eating zuppe di cozze piccante ... then a plate of tagliarini al boscaiolo .
colonel barge has requested ...
i withdraw your battery from antisamos beach .
lf they wanted to bring in heavy reinforcements ... this is where they would do it .
ls this an order?
captain ... don't you want to go home?
are you going to let us through?
my orders are to supervise ... the surrender of your arms and weapons .
the deadline for the hand over is at noon tomorrow .
this order comes from colonel barge .
he has asked me personally ... to assure you that if you surrender your arms ... you will be guaranteed safe passage .
like the ltalian garrison at lefkada?
lefkada?
but they laid down their weapons .
they went home .
you must be looking forward to seeing ltaly again .
do you think we could keep in touch?
i mean , after the war , of course .
you can have my gun when i've finished my cigarette .
get your hands off me , you ba
i understand your concern .
lf i were in your shoes , i would be asking questions , too .
of course , we will investigate what happened
i can tell you what happened .
my men are dead ! ... take the appropriate action .
what does that mean?
does it mean that i can write to the families of these men ... and tell them that their murderers will be charged ... that justice will prevail?
you force us at gunpoint to line up and surrender our arms .
you impound our weapons .
we're supposed to be allies !
captain corelli , please !
we need some kind of assurance .
i can assure you that the order to disarm ... did not come from my headquarters .
we have agreed to the surrender of our arms by noon tomorrow .
we would like your assurance that no more of our troops ... will be forcibly disarmed before that deadline .
herr general , by noon tomorrow ...
i guarantee you'll be on your way home .
this is not our war .
this is between the greeks and the germans .
would you prefer we left them to fight on their own?
the 4th regiment will hold antisamos .
we'll keep the 5th in reserve at assos ... and i will take the 8th and 9th to argostoli .
all gun lines to be in position by first light tomorrow .
lf we resist now , we can beat them .
what if the germans send planes?
don't go near argostoli .
stay away from antisamos beach .
i want to lie across the road so that you can't leave .
keep a gun with you at all times .
promise me .
come back to me .
promise me .
when it's over , you will come back to me .
i know what you feel .
you think if he died your world will stop .
i will look out for him .
mama !
stay here !
it's not safe !
drosoula !
what are you doing?
she's a traitor and a whore .
help me !
the enemy's a hundred metres away .
there's heavy armour coming .
gunther .
come on , move !
shoot me .
he's alive .
he's alive .
he was alive when i found him .
fragments of uniform in the bullet holes .
splinters of rib .
just do it .
i am not a surgeon .
i have no penicillin .
please !
i have no sterile water .
no serum .
please , father , do it !
hold .
four of his ribs are broken .
papa !
antonio .
don't move .
lf you even try to move , you will haemorrhage to death .
no , you must lie still .
how i don't
you were lying under carlo's body .
lf it wasn't for him , you wouldn't be alive .
how did i get here?
mandras found you .
antonio , you should try and drink something .
what would you like for lunch?
not that there is any choice , of course .
but if there was ...
we needed something steel , wire to bind the bones .
of course , they'll have to be removed sometime in the future .
i could try and get some new strings from somewhere .
i could ask around .
what are you doing?
lf they find me , they will shoot you both .
they'll kill you if you leave this house .
i don't belong here , pelagia !
i never belonged here !
ever since i came , look what has happened all around you .
i love you .
i had no right to make you love me ... when you weren't mine to love .
no !
don't do that !
go to doctor lannis's house .
go now .
go !
mama will be back !
dimitris will row you to a boat out in the bay .
you should be home by tomorrow night .
we must go .
i had to see you again .
one last time .
we must go !
don't say anything .
look at me .
we must go !
go .
why did you save him?
why didn't you leave him to die?
i wanted you to love me again .
ln albania , i made them read every one of these to me .
mandras , i love you .
mandras , i want you .
mandras , when are you coming back?
and then one day a different letter .
i don't know how to describe my feelings .
it's as if i've been waiting a hundred years ...
to hear from you .
waiting a hundred years for you to return .
once i thought my heart was overflowing ...
with love for you .
but now all i feel is emptiness .
and i think all the time it was a pretence ...
that i never loved you at all .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
the war we thought would never end is over .
and the island we thought we had lost forever is ours again .
ln the doctor's house there are three of us now ... the doctor , his daughter ... who is training to be a doctor ... and lemoni .
it's for you .
from ltaly .
what is it?
it's a record .
we should start making supper , that's what we should do .
antonio , i do not know ... if this letter will reach you , or even if you are alive .
perhaps someone else sent us your record ... and that is why we found no note .
i would like to say that pelagia is happy ... but she is full of tears she will not let fall ... and of a grief no doctor can mend .
she blames herself for the pain we have suffered ... and perhaps the same is true for you .
you know i am not a religious man ... but i believe this ... if there is a wound , we must try to heal it ... if there is someone whose pain we can cure ... we must search till we find them ... if the gods have chosen that we should survive ... it will be for a reason .
where is your miracle today then , eh?
what do we have to say about that?
wake up .
fetch the firewood .
fix the roof .
paint the house .
she's driving me mad .
when i was deaf , i couldn't hear her ... nagging .
but now
latre , i beg of you , help me .
put the pea back in my ear .
i was looking for lemoni .
she's down the road .
i went to the house .
it doesn't exist anymore .
we are building a new one .
your father wrote you got the record .
it's a guitar .
it's different .
i tried to live without you .
i tried to make myself believe i could live without you .
the scar healed well .
stamatis , do you love your wife?
lf you love your wife , my advice is be nice to her .
bring in the wood before she asks you for it .
lf she is cold , then put a shawl around her shoulders .
and bring her a flower ... every time you come back from the field .
you won't put the pea back in my ear?
that would be against the hippocratic oath .
