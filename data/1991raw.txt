who is it?
answer me , samantha .
don't you imagine it?
is it father joseph?
is that your lover?
he listens to me .
he listens to me and understands me .
but i do as well !
no , richard .
you don't listen to me anymore .
of course !
you never speak to me !
evidently we've got nothing to tell each other anymore .
this doesn't prevent us from being a couple !
a couple?
what is " a couple " for you?
i'm your husband and you're my wife !
i was your wife , but it's over now .
what?
can i help you?
i've got an appointment with doctor ...
monnier .
you're looking for dr. monnier .
that's right .
sixth floor , second door on the left .
thanks .
thanks .
see you soon .
good bye .
good evening .
good evening .
have you got an appointment?
yes , at six o'clock .
six o'clock?
sorry , i'm late , but i told your secretary that ...
it's alright , come in .
thanks .
my secretary is out .
you are ms ...?
what's your name?
oh , sorry , i am ...
yes?
hi jacques ...
not at all ...
no , let's talk about it now .
just a moment , don't hang up .
i have to talk 2 minutes to a colleague .
if you want to sit down in the meanwhile ...
please .
please .
no , no ...
i know , i know .
i tell you that i know .
counterfeited balance .
to be honest there's nothing i can do .
no , absolutely nothing .
you know what?
let me address him to our friend at the prosecutor's office .
he's specialized in those kinds of problems .
yes ...
let's do it that way .
sorry .
you forgot your purse .
being your first time , you have to fill in a form with some information .
information?
please , sit down .
your age , profession , civil state ...
who addressed you to me?
nobody .
i searched the phone book ,
i wanted someone near and so i called .
the first in the list couldn't before two months .
i had urgency and ...
urgency?
there's a problem ... a personal problem .
may i?
of course .
my husband doesn't bear it .
i had succeeded in quitting , but ...
a personal problem , you said?
yes .
with my husband .
we've been married for four years ...
sorry .
thanks .
we don't get along well anymore , my husband and i.
he's changed much since he stopped working ..
why , what happened to him?
health problems .
but do you work?
yes , i've always worked .
my husband didn't want me to , but ...
i'm not the housewife kind .
i'm a shop assistant in a boutique .
purses , suitcases ...
will you excuse me .
yes?
that's why i'm here , madam ...
see you tomorrow at five o'clock .
see you , madam .
pardon me , please .
apart from my husband i haven't got anyone to speak to .
not even your colleagues?
no , we only speak about the job .
anyone in your family?
no one .
i'm afraid i'll become crazy .
have you ever told that to your husband?
i tried , but ...
he treats me like a child .
we haven't got any children .
i wanted a few , but ...
it's too late .
he doesn't touch me anymore .
we haven't got sex anymore .
we haven't had sex for more than six months .
no more sex all of a sudden , while we used to be very close before .
and i miss it , to take pleasure from him .
but not only that .
also his kisses , his caresses ...
his body against mine ...
understand?
i'm not used to speak of myself this way .
i'd rather stop .
so?
will you accept?
accept what?
my case .
how many sessions will it take?
that's how they are called , isn't it?
i understand , you still don't know .
is next week possible?
on thursday at the same time?
doctor?
did you tell her you're a psychiatrist?
no , i haven't told her anything .
it's her who believes that .
she has taken me for doctor monnier .
who?
doctor monnier , the psychiatrist who has a study on my same floor .
she had an appointment with him .
and haven't you told her she had knocked on the wrong door?
i realized that when it was too late .
my clients often speak to me about their personal problems .
i thought that she wanted to consult me about a divorce .
can you pass me those books , please?
and what's she like?
what do you mean?
is she pretty?
i would not know .
while she was speaking she started to cry , and that ... made you upset .
what have you two spoken about?
her problems with her husband .
she has found an expert !
good morning .
good morning .
i am looking for a book .
could you give me more details?
room " is in the title , i think .
that's really useful .
do you still want to meet him?
who?
luc .
he's coming to get me .
the bodybuilder?
he isn't a bodybuilder , he manages a club .
a club for swinging couples?
a fitness club .
when you left me ...
wait a minute , it's you who left me , and the last time you did , was the seventh .
if she's sick she needs a real therapist .
you can't go on lying to her that way .
call her and tell her the truth .
i don't even know her name .
here is luc .
hi flea .
so ...
luc , this is william .
the famous william !
they say you're the best in your field , mate .
i'm not your mate .
he's so witty ! ... business booming , is it?
i don't understand what you mean .
let's go , flea .
you've got a body sculpture lesson .
bye .
let's hug each other next time , okay?
it's better .
william , when she comes you'll tell her " i am not a psychoanalyst ,
i'm a tax consultant " .
will you tell her?
of course .
who do you think i am?
according to you , mr. faber , can we contest the partition? ... because the tax inspector told me that ...
i told you that the administration made a mistake with the quotients assigning two parts to you .
your daughter , who is eighteen but still dependent on you , gives you the right to an additional half .
have you understood?
not really , no .
if you could repeat ...
everything will be alright .
i'll take care of your file .
thanks , mr. faber .
good day , madam .
good day sir .
your father?
how does it feel to be retired?
when i met him i still had my confectionery , the " ringo starr " .
send him my regards , please .
i will , thank you .
thanks a lot and see you .
see you , mr. michel .
i'm done with the typing .
do you still need me?
no , you can go , mrs. mulon .
enjoy your life !
do you want me to cook something for you?
no , i'll do it myself .
i know .
poor thing ...
good evening , doctor .
come in ...
there's something i didn't dare tell you the other time .
it's not easy .
i'm supposed to say everything , right?
as a matter of fact , i wanted to tell you ...
there's too much light , could you ...?
my husband doesn't touch me anymore .
better than being beaten .
but he would like ...
i'm sorry .
he wants me to have sex with another man .
oh , another man .
someone you know?
no , it doesn't matter who .
he's getting obsessed by this .
you have the right to fuck with anyone " .
it's him who uses the word " fuck " .
the women who do such things to survive have no choice but i ...
he's the one who needs professional help ...
how can you bear it?
we'd better break up .
we can't go on like that .
why?
that's how it is .
i've got to go now .
i'll give you what i owe you .
no , listen ...
no , i haven't got enough money , sorry .
i'll pay you next time .
when will it be?
monday , same time?
listen to me ...
i'm not a doctor .
aren't you?
i thought that ...
but have you understood what i want to say?
yes , i have .
not all the psychoanalysts are graduate , but a degree or a diploma , is the same to me .
see you on monday , doctor .
mrs. mulon ,
any phone calls?
from whom?
a young lady .
what's her name?
it doesn't matter .
no one has called .
good morning madam .
good morning .
sorry for the trouble .
could i speak with doctor monnier?
have you got an appointment?
no , i'm his neighbour , mr. faber .
the tax consultant .
oh , of course .
what would you like to tell him?
a friend of mine had to meet the doctor at the beginning of the month .
it is possible .
and?
well , we had lost contact , then we met again in the lift , but she was in a hurry .
i wanted to call her but i haven't got her number anymore .
what day exactly?
tuesday 2nd at six o'clock p . m .
yes , there was a patient .
it was her first session .
that's her .
but she didn't come
without notice .
it's her .
what's your friend's name?
i don't know , because i know her first name , but i don't absolutely know her family name .
rather twisted , your story .
but i need to contact her .
be kind .
i'll go and ask the doctor if he can receive you .
sofas as deep as graves " .
do you know this verse by baudelaire?
face to face will do , for a first session .
but i don't believe that ...
i'm listening .
i don't feel wanted anymore " ...
i think my husband is cheating on me " ...
he got the wrong woman and i got the wrong door " ...
but i'm not surprised by the mistake of this young lady .
to work on ourselves is not easy .
no , the strangest thing is your behaviour .
you didn't tell her she made a mistake .
the first time okay , but the second ...
however the thing is over .
she was supposed to come two days ago , but she hasn't and i haven't heard from her .
so everything is alright?
no , because i'd like to see her again .
you are free .
if she had opened your heart to you at a party would you have asked for my permission?
wait a moment , she has mistaken me for you ..
she has .
i don't like it when someone steals my clients .
but i've got to tell her the truth .
i need her number .
i don't know anything about her at all .
you already know too much .
i'd like to know where she lives , at least .
everyone would like to know many things , my dear gentleman , but it's not always possible .
no .
i am desolate , but
i cannot give out any information regarding patients above all when they're not even my own .
that'll be 120 .
euros .
it's part of the therapy .
of the therapy ...
i repeat , mr. chapel , that he'll receive you .
good bye .
good bye , madam .
but had said three o'clock , it has to be three o'clock !
... but please understand ...
calm down mr. chapel ...
but he said at three o'clock !
i'll go get you some water .
everything will be alright , you'll see .
i bring you the water .
calm down .
alright .
i'm fine , i apologize .
good morning .
good morning .
i wanted to say that i'm ... ...
meteo france " .
today , the weather in paris will be windy and rainy for the rest of the night .
therefore , the temperature will be rather fresh ...
excuse me , but a person insists to see you .
she hasn't got an appointment , but ...
i'll be right there .
shall we stay here?
no , come in .
want to know why i didn't come last time?
i have to tell you that i'm not doctor monnier .
i know .
i've known it for a while .
i wanted to delay our appointment , and when i called the real doctor monnier picked up .
his voice was different from yours .
it was a shock .
i thought , if he's not him , then ... ... then who is he?
i should have never returned here .
i thought it's disgusting .
that guy knows all about me and i know nothing about him .
so , mr. faber , you're a tax consultant .
what's your job about?
i help my clients to deal ... with their own taxes .
without cheating?
yes .
well , yes and no ...
you cheated on me .
the appearances are against me .
please to forgive me .
will you?
no .
i could have killed you .
i really could have .
listen , there's been a misunderstanding .
i am sorry about that .
and i , when i realized i had spoken about my problems to a perfect stranger , i felt dirty , as if you had raped me .
raped ...
yes , raped .
no one can help me ...
i don't agree ...
nobody can .
i'm coming .
am i disturbing you?
are you with the family?
the family?
no , no ...
i have wandered about the district .
i hate this hour , when it gets dark .
the shops close , the people return home ...
i should as well , but i was sorry i had left like that .
never mind .
i came again because i haven't got your number .
neither have i , mrs. de lambre ...
did you investigate on me?
well , you disappeared ...
no , i've only asked my neighbour , doctor monnier , if he could give me your number .
and?
don't you imagine?
i didn't want him to call me at home , because of my husband . ... and you gave him the number of the weather forecasts .
the first one which came to my mind .
we use it at the boutique .
when they say it will rain , we put the umbrellas in the windows .
on tuesday at half past six , mr. faber?
yes , of course .
but how can i call you?
anna , if you want .
no , i meant by phone ...
don't you ever call me .
see you on tuesday .
so?
what do you think?
it has a good bouquet .
i didn't mean the bordeaux but luc .
tell me honestly .
well , he is ... ... he's very physical , isn't he?
indeed .
not your kind at all .
you'll have to get rid of my books ...
there is no hurry ...
mister muscle doesn't care that you're spending the evening with me?
i told him i had a meeting at the faculty .
have you seen her again?
who?
the weeping girl .
yes .
have you told her you aren't a psychiatrist?
of course .
i had to .
whose makeup is this?
yours .
did you keep it?
yes , just in case ...
don't you want to stay?
no , william .
tonight was just ... just nothing .
hello?
hello !
hello , who is it !
who was it?
no one , i hung up .
were you waiting for a phone call?
no .
which floor?
the sixth .
me too .
thank you , but i'd rather use the stairs .
up to six floors?
i prefer so .
i'm early .
the first time i saw this sofa i thought it wasn't bad at all ...
sometimes i take a nap ...
i was late today because the streets were full of people , and i don't like the crowd .
i had to walk through secondary streets .
wouldn't it be simpler for you to come by car?
my husband forbids me to drive .
he forbids you to drive , he forbids you to smoke ...
what else?
who knows what he does alone in the house all day .
and how do you spend your days?
i try to survive .
i get up , i go to work ... ... and that's it .
wouldn't you like to do something else , a more interesting job , perhaps?
i have already done all .
shop assistant , waitress , smoker ...
drinker in times of depression .
there's something that ... but it's rather a passion than a job .
when i was a child i studied classical dance for seven years .
it was fantastic , hard but fantastic .
my old teacher , above all .
he was the first one to show some interest for me
really .
who knows if i could still ...
why don't you try?
please , have a try .
come on ...
excuse me , but ... an urgent fax has arrived .
i'll be back later .
wouldn't you like to dance again?
a star of the ballet?
i'm too old for that .
age doesn't matter , if you believe in yourself .
well ...
i used to , when i was young ...
when you were young ...
well , yes .
i have done everything too soon and too badly .
i left school at 14 .
i left home at 16 .
home " so to speak .
we lived in a camper .
my mother thought it was more practical , because we travelled all the time .
we were always travelling .
to the south , in the sun , without love or hate , i simply didn't exist .
sometimes , in the evening , she brought in a man .
she made me go out and forgot about me .
my mother has never brought anybody in .
i have to go now .
my train leaves in half an hour .
do you live far?
in switzerland .
in a quiet corner of the suburbs .
small gardens , small houses ...
i imagine that switzerland is like that .
see you next time?
see you , madam .
see you .
see you .
anything wrong , mrs. mulon?
nothing , apart from the ashtrays i have to empty .
is she a new client?
yes , why?
i haven't got any file on her .
i'm taking care of her file .
personally .
the majority of my patients come here for complaining .
nobody wants to listen to others anymore .
not even hairdressers or waiters have got the patience anymore .
this young woman has found the ideal listener in you .
but it's not a good thing ...
since she hasn't got any serious pathologies ...
i can't forbid you to see her .
your job , after all , is not very different from mine .
we both deal with the same types of neurosis : what is declared and what is kept hidden .
well , i can listen to her , but as for solving problems ...
the lady's or yours?
mr. faber is going to be busy for a while .
you hadn't got an appointment , miss ...
mrs.
and after that , he has another appointment .
i'll wait .
can i deduce the customs duty?
otherwise they'll tax me twice , and that's not fair .
last time it was even an old stock .
i can't accept your case , too many details are missing .
but you have got everything ...
yes , but it's a complex case .
yes , but ...
no , i'm telling you your case is complex , very , very complex .
do you understand?
we'll speak about it some other time .
i'm sorry .
after you .
see you .
talk to you soon , dear sir .
you forgot it here .
thanks .
it got stuck .
may i?
thanks .
isn't it too boring?
the files , all those papers ...
boring?
no , not at all .
you know , taxes can tell a whole life , they tell a lot of things , births , marriages , divorces , success , failures and deaths .
my delays worry my husband when i come here .
but what worries him?
he thinks that i meet someone .
someone?
a psychologist?
no .
a man , a lover , that's it .
but isn't that what he wanted?
only if i tell him about it .
i told him i had to stay at the shop till late .
i don't know why i lied to him .
but tell him the truth ...
what?
that i go to a psychiatrist's?
that would be another lie .
and , which is worse , he wouldn't understand what i do in here .
he would imagine other things .
but you aren't forced to tell him everything .
secrets are allowed in a couple .
in a couple , yes .
why do you always wear a tie?
are you forced to?
no , i'm not forced at all ...
it reassures you .
yes , mrs. mulon?
oh , never mind .
could i have something to drink?
certainly .
mrs. mulon , would you be so kind
as to bring us two cups of coffee , please?
tea .
wait a second ...
a tea and a coffee , please .
what does he think?
this isn't a cafe ...
my husband , i've seen him dead .
in a dream?
no , for real .
i am very sorry .
when did it happen?
six months ago .
he was about to die for my fault .
when i was small i couldn't read , count , walk ...
it still happens to me sometimes .
i can't tell left from right ,
i confuse the words ...
you get the wrong doors ...
that too .
that evening i was getting the car out of the garage , and the electric gate , you know?
no , i don't ...
a wrong manoeuvre .
i drove backwards too fast and i didn't notice that my husband was there , hiding in the dark .
what was he doing in the dark?
it's a game between us .
i heard him shout .
too late .
i smashed his left leg against the wall .
i made him an invalid .
wheelchair?
no , only a cane .
he isn't happy to use it , but sometimes he falls down and i have to help him get up .
thanks .
thanks , mrs. mulon .
thanks .
he hasn't touched me since then , since the accident .
according to him , another man would be a way to bring back his desire .
it's a dangerous game .
what if you fell in love?
with whom?
with the other man .
i should meet him , before .
who's that sad woman?
i don't know ...
nobody .
it makes me shiver .
i used to think that she was my father's secret lover , but he's too serious for that .
even if for some time he had a crush on madame mulon .
the secretary?
yes , she was his own , at first .
she had some kind of vagueness .
vagueness?
i don't know what it means .
it means ... she was attractive .
see you .
good bye .
see you .
i can finally shake a hand , yours , at least .
it's a beginning .
see you on thursday .
good morning , mrs. mulon .
jeanne , good morning !
i thought she wasn't coming to see you anymore .
even now that she knows you aren't a psychiatrist ...
oh , i understand .
no , you don't ...
she only speaks to me about her husband , a vicious man who makes her suffer .
she only has to leave him .
it's not so simple , he dominates her and she is afraid of him .
luckily , she met you .
you will save her ...
hm hmmm .
i can't believe that !
what?
you said " hmmm " like a psychiatrist .
and how do you know that psychiatrists say " hmmm "?
because i've been in analysis for six months .
you too?
but why?
i'm elaborating my mourning .
mourning?
has anyone died?
i'm elaborating the mourning of our story .
so?
how about the sofa?
the small one , i have come for it ...
i'm glad you're taking it away , it's useless .
it'll suit your place much better .
it is nice , isn't it?
delicious .
hold on , take away this too .
you have always said that you liked it so much ...
are you sure that you won't miss it?
no .
leave it to me , mrs. mulon ...
thanks .
my pleasure .
hi willy .
this is a men's thing .
thanks a lot .
my goodness , it's huge !
the biggest on the market .
you're so lucky ...
if you like it , i can get you one .
the importer works out in my club .
very kind of you , but i haven't got the license .
it's a joke , isn't it?
well , come on .
we have to hurry , the traffic is terrible at this hour .
how strange , i knew you would say that .
you aren't zen at all .
no , i am not zen .
i have swallowed an umbrella , and it was open .
you should chill out , mate .
what are you doing here?
where is your wicked secretary?
it's her day off .
why do you say she's wicked?
she looks like it .
where were you?
at a client's , for a tax inspection .
it went on for hours .
you could have called me .
how could i?
and then we hadn't got an appointment .
we did , it was for wednesday .
no , it was for thursday .
no , it was for wednesday .
i haven't dreamt of it .
oops it was for thursday .
sometimes i get confused , you know .
yes , i do .
i have to pee .
i can't resist .
it's at the end of the corridor on the left .
should i take you there?
thanks , i don't need any witnesses .
on the left ...
i've understood .
this house is so tidy ...
everything is in place , perfectly ...
who cleans up?
i do it myself .
is it a mania?
no , i just like it .
it was my dad's lighter ,
it's all that he left , besides a photo .
and i don't even know if he's my father .
you're dying to know more , aren't you?
he died in a car accident shortly after my birth .
my mother was driving .
she killed my father and i have almost killed my husband .
now you've got the whole picture .
how strange ...
what?
the accident which repeats itself , from mother to daughter .
did you get rid of the sad woman?
yes , poor thing .
she had been there for thirty years ...
have you lived here for thirty years?
longer than that .
i was born here , i have never moved .
this office was my father's .
when he retired he left it to me .
and you put your toys in here ...
as you can see .
this is funny .
what's it's name?
is it a secret?
my taw taw .
what does it mean?
my toy "?
i think so .
careful , please .
it's fragile .
and what did your father do?
same as me .
oh .
also this repeats itself , from father to son .
i would never imagine i'd do his same job .
when i was a teen i wanted to be an explorer to conquer a lot of women and the world ... and then the world reduced itself to this apartment .
but don't you ever travel?
yes , for my job .
last year i went to belgium .
and how about the women?
are you single?
we cannot speak about you?
there's a closed door at the bottom .
it's my parents 'room .
no , i was speaking of you , not of your apartment .
do you live here?
no , i'm going to see someone .
me too , my psychiatrist .
doctor monnier?
are you going to see him as well?
no , another person .
another psychiatrist?
more or less ...
and is he good?
not bad .
how is yours?
like a dentist .
but he hurts me even more .
i cannot use lifts .
why?
i just can't .
not even a floor , just to try?
no .
doctor monnier says i'm not ready .
i wanted ...
i ...
oh ...
no no ...
no , sorry ...
no no , i beg you .
please tell me .
my husband doesn't touch me anymore because ... because he hasn't got erections anymore .
i would not care , really we could do other things . but he feels like he's dead .
well no , not exactly .
he still has obsessions .
for example he likes ...
fantasies
yes , fantasies .
for example , he likes to watch me wash myself or go to bath .
really ...
as long as it helps him ...
don't you understand?
no , i can't understand .
i think he should have himself cured .
what you said is horrible .
and isn't your husband horrible too?
why don't you get rid of him?
i already have .
no , i meant , why don't you take back your freedom?
freedom is not for me to leave him , it's to find him again .
i apologize , i am sorry .
i'm sorry .
it's nothing .
mr. faber ...
were you coming to see me?
no no , i was passing by .
passing by?
yes .
i'm going to lunch .
have you had lunch?
no .
patients are the ones who make the investigation and gather the clues .
psychoanalysts don't know anything .
they only know what the patients know .
are you following me?
not really .
no , because the more i see her
and the less i understand what's happening .
here's the dessert .
chinese fruit's salad .
thanks .
and the bill .
thanks .
listen .
the knots of your tie are impeccable , your business is going very well , but let your unwanted and temporary contact with psychoanalysis teach you this , at least : you haven't got everything under control , there is something that escapes you .
we aren't in my study and therefore this isn't a consultation , but nothing prevents you from paying for my lunch .
something's just passed through my mind .
who tells you that she's really married?
why would she lie to me?
didn't you make her believe you're a psychoanalyst?
what if she's a mythomaniac?
the fake neurotic and the fake psychiatrist .
it could be .
even better , she didn't get the wrong door and rang your bell willingly .
samantha listen to me !
i beg you , be reasonable !
i can't be reasonable !
i am in love with you !
this is a test , and you have to pass it !
i cannot love women !
because you're a priest?
excuse me .
which floor?
and you?
the sixth .
me too .
good morning .
you don't want to listen to me anymore?
if i didn't want to , i would address you to doctor monnier .
what does he look like?
he has a typical aspect , no one would mistake him for a tax consultant .
and your husband?
my husband?
what does he look like?
have you got a husband or not?
have you got a cigarette?
no .
what's his name?
marc .
are you happy now?
he made a scene .
a scene?
why?
he's jealous?
he knows that i go to a doctor .
why , he followed you?
with that leg?
how could he?
no .
he must have peeped in my notebook .
he says we have to tell each other everything , and i so told him everything .
what?
that i've got a lover .
that i go to bed with him after work .
my husband thinks that you're the one .
me?
yes .
well , the psychiatrist .
they can have an affair with their patients , can't they?
but what went through your mind to tell him that?
he wanted me to meet someone and i have .
i can't understand the way it works between you two .
before i met him , i was the cripple .
he lit everything up with his gaiety .
his gaiety , yes .
it is a word out of fashion , i know .
he was always cheerful , that's why i loved him .
you don't love him anymore?
i feel some affection for him .
if you do , why do you come here?
what are you expecting from me?
i've had enough of your interrogatory tone .
my client ...
so far my client hasn't received the transaction for the inheritance .
well , am i sorry but at this point ... will you excuse me for a second?
don't hang up .
come in , please .
i'm sorry .
yes , it's annoying , very annoying .
look , i'll give you the 12th as a limit , otherwise ...
no , not one day more .
alright .
thanks for understanding .
see you , lawyer .
excuse me , you are mr ...
exactly .
i'm listening .
it's complicated .
i'm used to that .
what's the problem?
you .
you know my wife anna .
i am marc , she must have spoken of me .
this is where it happens , then ...
at first i thought it was doctor monnier who fucked my wife .
i sent someone who could confirm that .
actually she didn't go to a physician , she lied to me , which means she has got something to hide .
listen ...
i don't think she comes here for the taxes , but it is alright , she is free .
what do you want from me?
i wanted to see your face .
is your leg any better?
she tells you everything !
not all , but she told me about the accident .
and you believed her?
i understand you .
sometimes it's better not to know the truth .
you !
make her happy !
mr. faber?
your lift is out of standards .
if the box falls down , there isn't any safety system .
let's hope it never happens when you're inside it .
that gentleman is so nice !
very .
having understood that father joseph is homosexual ,
samantha gets depressed . and tries to put and end to her days , but richard intervenes just in time to save her .
he is ready to forgive her .
can love between them spring up again?
where are we?
almost on the second floor .
how do you feel?
i feel bad !
i feel like shouting !
then shout !
don't be ashamed .
careful , i'm going to shout !
come on !
it's a recurrent dream .
that's why i speak of it , because when it happens i ...
how do you feel?
you found me ridiculous , didn't you?
not at all .
i know what that means .
it is a great day for me , an immense victory .
also for me , believe me , but you'll see , next time you'll do it alone .
you won't need to go to dr. monnier anymore .
and why do you go to a psychiatrist?
it is him who needs me , i am his only patient .
bye .
coming here , i thought i was on holiday .
when it's sunny i remember the summers i used to spend in the south .
people feel free , they do everything with calm , they go to the beach by scooter ...
do you understand?
more or less .
is everything alright?
yes , everything's alright .
for you too , it seems?
yes , i feel better .
did you notice?
for a few days , i don't know why , i've felt ... happier .
even my husband noticed i've changed , but of course he thinks it's because of the sex .
he began again .
he's no longer satisfied by the fact that i've got someone , therefore i told him what the two of us do .
the two of us?
me and my lover .
and what have you told him?
sex on the psychiatrist's sofa .
he likes the fact that it's a psychiatrist , a tax consultant would be very less stimulating .
no offence meant .
can i tell you everything?
i think so .
telling him ... what i do with my lover , i ...
yesterday , while having a bath , i caressed myself .
it wasn't the first time , but yesterday i reached the top .
the top of what?
to have an orgasm " sounds medical , so i say " to reach the top " .
how do you say that?
why are you looking at me like that?
do you think i'm sick?
because you had a bath?
i don't think i can go on .
it's normal , you weren't prepared for this .
women who speak of their orgasms terrify men .
they wake up ancient fears from early childhood , but you cannot stop .
it will end when it has to end .
this half open door on the feminine mystery can hardly be closed again .
... no , because mr. faber i have to tell you that your father was totally ...
mr. fernand , he was an incredible person , he was perfect .
i understood all ...
how much does she pay you?
nothing ...
are you crazy?
she has to pay , it's the rule .
how far did you get?
she speaks and you listen?
that's all?
of course !
does that surprise you?
not from you .
you have never been able to take the initiative .
curious , this block .
she must be wondering what you're waiting for ...
she doesn't come to me for that .
you think?
a woman who tells a tax consultant about her orgasms?
do you get excited , at least?
you don't understand anything !
have you made a vow of chastity?
wait !
you came to me to ask for advice , you should know what you want !
i don't know anything anymore !
it's simple , either you let her go or you fuck her !
i what?
you haven't answered me !
but i can't !
i cannot court her .
or you don't want to .
jeanne , you're jealous .
so what?
when i first met you you had dreams and ambitions , you wanted to write a novel , and you ended up cataloguing old books in a library .
the dust has made you acid .
good evening .
what are you doing here?
your fascinating secretary said i could wait for you .
i walked around the house .
not bad at all !
there was a naked girl at the window .
you must never get bored here ...
but what ...
are you crazy?
you're hurting me !
and you hurt me .
get out of here !
get out at once !
i have no intention to speak with you !
i have thought about it a lot .
we can't go on like this , the three of us .
what are you talking about?
of your relationship .
there's no relationship !
i'm in love with her .
i had foreseen that .
i understand you .
and have you told her?
i didn't imagine she would like a man of your kind , but she found someone , it's better than nothing .
but i don't want you two to hide .
you have to do it in my house .
you're joking , aren't you?
do you think?
come and fuck my wife at my house .
it excites me .
i'm not dead yet ...
before meeting her , i was a poor jerk .
i didn't know that such a woman could exist .
the woman of my life .
it has to mean something ...
till death us do part .
you are sick .
love is a disease , yes .
incurable .
how's your husband?
you really care about that?
yes .
he's okay , he's calmer .
he isn't asking questions anymore .
the beast in the jungle " .
is it set in africa , and deals with fierce beasts?
no , it is set in england and deals with grey people and melancholy ...
i can lend it to you , if you want .
thanks .
is that dress new?
do you like it?
yes , it fits you very well .
no ...
no , please , turn it off .
thanks .
excuse me , but there's an urgent phone call .
the notary of the succession marchand , insists for speaking to you .
tell him i'll call him back .
i am busy , as you can see .
well , i better go .
no , no , why?
your job is more important than me .
i'll call you .
bye .
do you want me to turn it on?
no , no , it is alright .
hello?
what do you want?
why are you calling me at this hour?
which window?
see you .
that lady wants you to call her back at this number .
how long ago did she call?
ten minutes .
couldn't you pass her through to me?
you were on a meeting .
hello?
you were kind to call me back .
where are you now?
at work?
i have to speak to you .
immediately?
yes , immediately .
come here , i'll be waiting .
see you .
the weather forecasts didn't foresee the rain?
so many unpredictable things are happening me ...
would you like to drink something?
a coffee?
yes please ...
no , i'd rather have ...
i don't know , something strong .
i can't find my father anymore ... my father's lighter .
maybe i forgot it here?
i'll look for it .
the other time , going out of here , it was raining .
do you remember?
and who was on the corner of the road?
my husband .
he was elegant , he wore a new shirt .
i asked him if he had an appointment , and he answered me that ... yes , with me .
he smiled .
he had booked a room in a hotel nearby , in the district .
i sat on the bed , i didn't know what to do .
he put his hand right here , on my neck ...
a violent gesture , at first it frightened me . but then he started caressing me , and at the same time he stripped me .
he caressed my neck , my breasts , my thighs ...
he told me tender words .
he seemed a different man .
he pushed me down on the bed and left the light on .
he took my hand for me to caress him and we never left each other all night .
we found each other again .
i won't tell you the details .
on the contrary , don't spare me any detail ...
his mouth ... his tongue ... his fingers ... his fantasies .
sado , maso , scat ...
penetration?
vaginal?
anal?
but what's wrong with you?
you can tell me everything but i cannot listen to everything .
i have seen you tonight , with your husband .
the room was in front of my study .
you didn't notice , i guess .
no .
your husband came to see me , right here .
i don't believe you .
he came here twice .
didn't you know it?
why did he come here?
to speak to me of you .
you speak to me of him , he speaks to me of you .
and why didn't you tell me?
he wanted me to go and fuck his wife in his house , that's what he said .
in the end he found more exciting to fuck her in front of my house .
last night , at the hotel , didn't he make a phone call?
i don't know .
he called me , so i could enjoy the show .
yes?
a client has been here for half an hour .
should i tell him to wait?
no , tell him i'm coming .
we are over .
you look awful ...
don't let anything poison your blood .
they say that life as a couple should be a source of happiness , but i've lived much better since i've been divorced .
i can watch crappy tv programmes for hours , eating chips .
good morning .
i wanted to give you back your book .
it doesn't suit me .
the story is touching , but it ends badly .
have you found my lighter?
no .
this is for you .
you're very kind , thanks .
come in , please .
only for two minutes , then .
come in .
it's our new travelling collection .
travelling?
you can use it for shopping , if you want .
we didn't see each other for ...
two weeks and two days .
i shouldn't have told you those things , last time .
i didn't want to shock you , but ...
i was so happy to have found my husband again .
at least i believed .
i understood some things , things that hurt me .
we talked , i spoke my heart out to him and i feel better .
i want to leave him .
you want to leave him?
what if he doesn't agree?
so much the worse for him .
i'm taking back my freedom .
it was your advice , wasn't it?
what about us?
our conversations ...
there's nothing left to tell each other .
well ...
anna !
i am happy for you to feel better .
try to be happy .
with anyone , but happy .
good bye .
hi .
hi .
am i too early?
no , i've just stopped working .
not on sunday !
it's good for killing time .
it feels so good .
with luc i only ate vegetables and rice .
why , did you eat at all?
jeanne ...
we broke up .
has he left you?
no , i have .
he is a nonentity ... such a nonentity !
even in his arms i felt lonely .
there are other men ...
actually there aren't so many others .
i'm sorry .
forget about it , please .
good morning , this is the study faber .
leave a message .
see you .
william?
it's me , anna .
are you in the house?
no?
if you're there don't pick up .
i'm imagining you at your desk , with the tie .
no !
not on sunday , at least !
it's over , i have decided to start a new life , a lighter life .
i'm not a frightened girl anymore .
i have grown up , i think , thanks to you .
i had never felt so good with anybody else .
we could freely tell each other everything , without cheating , without lying .
i didn't believe it was possible .
i'm leaving , away from here , away from everything , to try and start over .
i owe this to you as well .
i'm glad i knocked on the wrong door .
i wanted to say thanks .
thanks for everything .
well , here's my train .
i have to go .
good bye .
mr. faber , are you leaving us?
well , it's now or never , doctor .
how about that woman?
do you still see her?
no , she left paris ,
and she also left her husband .
this proves you've succeeded .
succeeded?
it is the purpose of the therapy , to cut it off , to move .
good bye , doctor .
mr. faber , we found this under the sofa .
thanks .
5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ... 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ...
no , stop , stop , stop .
pascal , stop .
that's not good .
this isn't " swan lake " , you seem a bunch of elephants ...
once again .
with more grace , children , okay?
straighten your backs , this way .
good ...
let's start again .
in line !
5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ...
anna?
someone left you this message .
i couldn't understand well .
thanks .
very well ...
vivienne , your head !
we can meet there tomorrow at eleven o'clock , if it's okay .
don't forget to bring the report of your incomes , we'll need it .
it's alright , agreed .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
good morning .
you came ...
the message said that someone had something for me .
how did you find me?
i called your number .
which number?
the weather forecasts '.
they said it would be rainy in the north and sunny in the south .
i hesitated , then ...
no .
i was sure you'd go south .
deep south , in the sun . as when you were small , with the beach and the scooters ...
do you remember all?
the question is " why? " .
why have i looked for you everywhere?
i missed our appointments .
so did i.
so?
where were we?
