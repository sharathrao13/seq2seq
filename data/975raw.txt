sir , he's not really blind .
he's a scam artist .
a very fast and agile one .
mr. vargas here runs numbers out ofhis chinese restaurant , but unfortunately ... some ofhis own bets turned sour .
how sour?
he owes the scottish mob $50, 000 .
i didn't know there was a scottish mob !
lfhe doesn't pay in two days , they'll kill him .
hello !
hi !
just doing our msg test .
everything seems to pass inspection .
that's $52 . 23 for the food ... $100 delivery charge 'cause we don't normally come out here .
why is that?
you afraid ofwhite people?
'causeyou all carry diseases my people don't have immunities for .
perhaps you'rejust being paranoid .

please don't tell !
i was going to become dumpling boy next week .
why isn't a smart boy likeyou ... in college?
it's painful to discuss .
i hit puberty in the first grade , and there's only so many times ... a seven year old can be called " fire hose " before he cracks .
that's really too bad because my family provides ... a $50, 000 cash scholarship ... to minority students , and i thought ...
$50, 000?
yeah . $50, 000?
yup , that's it .
look at that .
will you touch it?
the fire hose is gone !
it's a miracle .

i'm sorry .
i'm awful sorry .
but i knowyou don't care becauseyou germans are the greatest !
next time somebody says germans are humorless people ...
i'm gonna tell them to come to this house .
i must tell you ...
soyou started a few wars , all right?
actually , you started everywar .
it's not likeyou everwon one !
we kicked france's ass .

well , it seems like the two ofyou have issues to work out .
i'm going to go outside .
doyou know what he did to me when i was a child?
no , but why don't we get leo and tell him?
he locked me in a room with a boa constrictor ... and told me i couldn't get out until i killed it .
the important thing is thatyou got out and you're fine .

but look at the wonderful complexion you have .

father , i don't want to participate in this .
it's wrong .

my familywas never part ofthe contract .
neitherwas your girlfriend's family or her best friend .
but i don't care .
i'm gonna kill 'em all !
he's gonna kill my family .

the man you know as pest is actually an operative in your secret service .
the underworld has placed a high price on his head .
i intend to collect .
see , felix?
i told you that my pest wasn'tjust a bum !
actually , i lied .
i'm just hunting him ... because no one will miss an inconsequential flotsam like him .
that makes more sense .
how could you agree with this monster?
be quiet .
sit down .
he gets angry .
you stay here and guard them .
i'm going to go look around .
oh , jack !
oh , slapjones , we finally got the good stuff , kid .
