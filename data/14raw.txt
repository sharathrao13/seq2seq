matayan !
matayan !
in september 1600 , the tragic battle of sekigahara ended with ...
matayan !
matayan !
matazo !
takeyan !
matazo !
takeyan !
i'm still alive !
i won't die !
i won't die !
matayan !
don't die in vain !
where are you hurt?
where are you hurt?
my thigh .
a spear got me .
bear it !
it's not that bad .
bear it !
matayan !
can you stand?
i can do it !
what are you doing?
you must be one of the scavengers who search soldiers corpses for valuables .
akemi , let's go .
akemi , let's go .
okay .
mother , is it alright?
what is?
what is?
hiding them here .
we have nothing to worry about .
they're still greenhorns .
but , what if during our absence ...
afraid they will come looking for defeated soldiers?
we will worry about it when the time comes .
takeyan !
you're so fortunate .
you're so fortunate .
why?
you didn't get hurt .
i might get a limp .
you fool !
all who sided with the toyotomi are social outcasts now !
it is the tokugawa's world from now .
who got me into this ...?
takeyan , you're to blame !
you're right .
you're right .
that's right !
if you hadn't asked me , i wouldn't have come here .
you said even a squire's son could prosper if he could just take the head of a captain .
you fooled me !
i was fooled into coming with you !
look what happened !
such a hopeless battle !
you are to blame for everything !
stop brooding .
it was just a dream ...
like a dream , it ended !
we were just unlucky .
i don't think that we'll see another great battle .
we were born too late .
i left home without telling anyone .
and otsu ...
i think i'm losing my mind !
otsu !
i wonder what otsu's doing now .
otsu !
otsu !
they might hear us .
you're not alone .
i have an elder sister waiting for my return , too ...
sister ...
shinmen takezo hon'iden matahachi
otsu san ...
do you dream of matahachi?
yes , many times .
then , he's dead ...
i also dream of my younger brother .
granny !
this is bad luck !
how foolish !!
your takezo tricked my son into going off to battle !
ogin , listen to me .
takezo might be satisfied !
but my matahachi was a very , very precious heir for the hon'iden !
i can't afford for matahachi to die !
he won't die !
he can't die !
right , otsu?
takezo is the god of ill fortune for the hon'iden family !
matayan , get a hold of yourself .
and get well soon .
we have no choice .
let's go home and be farm squires again .
how will we face them?
i'll apologize to granny and to otsu .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
washing it with alcohol .
go help out akemi .
this is awful .
listen .
you must bear the pain .
missus !
bear it !
missus !
what are you looking at , takezo san?
the coming winter .
winter?
it's depressing .
when mount ibuki turns white , we live like bagworms .
we just wait till spring .
i don't get it?
i don't get it?
what?
akemi chan , why do you and your mother live so dangerously?
we can't make a living by selling moxa only .
besides , mother is a widow to the chief of the bandits .
the top one in ibuki shichigo .
so , akemi chan is one of them?
i'm just a child of the wilderness .
i was just raised by them .
then , you have to find a good husband .
hey , you know what?
what?
what?
who my husband is?
how would i know?
don't worry !
it's not you , takezo san !
akemi chan .
akemi chan .
what?
why do you have that bell on your sleeve?
i don't know .
i don't know .
don't know?
funny , you have it on .
but i didn't put it on .
my mother did .
i've had it on as long as i can remember .
i grew up listening to the bell .
doesn't it sound beautiful?
i sewed these for you .
which print do you like better?
what's wrong?
what's wrong?
i hate my mother !
i hate matahachi san , too !
i hate all of you !
where are you going , takeyan?
where are you going , takeyan?
never mind .
let's walk .
never mind?
you're acting so strange .
matayan , let's go home .
go home?
go home?
right now .
without telling the family?
i think it's best .
no way .
i have my conveniences .
they did so much for me .
they did so much for me .
i'm getting scared .
matayan , otsu san is waiting .
your granny is also waiting .
you are fully recovered now .
matayan , let's go home !
okay !
takeyan .
you go home first .
i'll leave later on .
takezo san !
matahachi san !
my mother will be killed !
damn you !
she used her daughter to steal valuables off the corpses at sekigahara !
she kept all the profits !
i heard all about it !
everyone !
search the house !
everyone !
search the house !
okay !
search carefully !
see , i told you !
according to bandit rules , take it all !
she'll serve as an example !
go strangle her !
an intruder !
he must be a straggler from sekigahara !
get him !
wait !
wait !
mata san !
let's run away !
run?
run?
yes !
they won't give up so easy .
he always wanted to get me anyway .
that man?
that man?
now is our chance to run !
we will live in another province !
okay !
we'll live together !
okay?
but ...
what's takeyan doing?
takeyan !
takeyan !
never mind !
i don't care about him !
i don't like him !
akemi , you feel the same , don't you?
hurry !
get ready !
hurry !
i won't let you go !
matayan , i did it !
matahachi !
i did it !
matayan !
matahachi !
oh , no !
matahachi !
matahachi !
matahachi !
you fool !
what will you do about otsu?
priest takuan !
oh , otsu san?
getting ready for the festival tomorrow?
yes .
what are you doing there?
we are celebrating buddha's birth tomorrow .
it's a very auspicious holiday .
i am washing off the lice into the river , because tomorrow i intend to be a bit of a dandy !
you're so funny , takuan san !
if you spot a straggler from the battle of sekigahara , you must report it immediately .
hey .
hey !
wait !
damn it !
rifles , fire !
to worshipers ... we are just a poor temple .
please be generous with your offerings .
you can never donate too much .
takuan san .
takuan san .
yes .
please don't demand offerings .
i'm directing my preachings to the wealthy .
lightening their load is part of piety .
hey !
hey !
young lad !
you can't be popular with women like that .
you can't be popular with women like that .
fool .
takuan san , please stop that or i'll really get angry .
oh , granny hon'iden .
what is it?
what is it?
have you paid your respects?
to who?
to who?
your son , matahachi .
he will never die !
takezo can die , but not our matahachi !
right , otsu?
move !
everyone gather around !
move !
hey !
be silent !
attention villagers !
i'm a vassal from himeji castle .
aoki tanzaemon is my name .
a few days ago ... a man of this village named shinmen takezo ... slipped past our checkpoint !
he is an offspring of shinmen munisai !
in the sekigahara battle ... he sided with the toyotomi .
i'm wondering where he's hiding?
we've yet to find any trace of him .
therefore , an investigative team will be established .
we must find him at all costs !
all villagers must cooperate with us .
and anyone who aids him shall be severely punished .
understood?
otsu , did you hear that?
if takezo has returned ... then matahachi might also have returned .
okay , let's go .
gon san !
gon san !
gonroku !
gonroku !
did matahachi return?
did matahachi return?
what?
i don't know .
granny ...
granny ...
what?
maybe we should go to ogin san's ...
they are siblings !
she might know !
ogin dono ...
i heard the devil is back .
call him here .
you know who i mean .
it's takezo !
you're hiding him somewhere !
no .
no .
it's obvious !
you must be hiding him somewhere !
you must be hiding him somewhere !
that's not true !
he hasn't returned !
if he had returned , he would come to see me .
you had an old woman come all the way here !
yet you have the gall to deny it !
he's there !
takezo !
so , he was here after all .
ogin !
remember this !
hey otsu !
we don't want to get involved .
let's go .
let's go .
but ...
i see .
you keep watch here .
granny , i'll get a lantern .
no need !
i'm the granny of hon'iden !
i am not so senile that i need a lantern !
old woman !
wait a moment !
did you just leave the shinmen residence?
yes , that's right .
are you a shinmen?
are you a shinmen?
hardly !
i'm a squire retiree from across the river !
i see .
then , you're the famous hon'iden granny?
that's right .
you poor thing !
why do you say that?
why do you say that?
i heard matahachi died at sekigahara .
but don't worry .
i'll take your revenge for sure .
sir , i know a good way of capturing takezo .
lend me your ears .
which one is takezo's sister?
which one is takezo's sister?
don't be rude as i'm a woman living alone .
it's this one .
seize her !
it's this one .
seize her !
what are you doing?
so rough !
otsu san !
take her !
take her !
yes , sir !
just remain quiet , okay !
oh !
otsu san .
excuse me?
where's the bath?
where's the bath?
the bath?
it's this way .
wanna join me .
please stop it !
what's wrong !
bastard !
you're takezo !
everyone , come here !
we found takezo !
priest , did you see takezo?
priest , did you see takezo?
i know nothing !
hey !
hey !
he's over this way !
hurry !
let's go !
dear ancestors ... people say matahachi is dead .
but i cannot believe that .
unlike the cowardly takezo ...
he has lost in battle and is too ashamed to face us .
my son , otsu ...
is waiting to give you these clothes that she made .
return home soon ... and show granny your cheerful face .
granny ...
who is it?
you're ...?
granny , i came to see you .
what?
why did you return alone?
what happened to matahachi?
what happened to matahachi?
granny , matahachi is alive .
he's not dead .
he's living with a woman in another province .
matahachi !
with another woman !
please tell otsu san .
granny , please tell her !
now i feel better .
since i told you this , i have no other business in this village .
takezo .
where are you going now?
first , i plan to ... see my sister and then i intend to leave miyamoto village .
granny , i won't see you again .
wait !
takezo ...
aren't you hungry?
haven't eaten for days .
poor soul ...
i have dinner almost ready .
don't hesitate .
your family and mine have been friends since the days of the akamatsu clan .
parting will be hard .
please go ahead .
hurry !
hurry around the back .
someone may see you .
i'll check the bath .
granny !
gon !
gon !
takezo's back .
takezo's back .
takezo !
quiet !
go tell the officers .
takezo?
how's the water temperature?
it's a good bath , granny .
i feel like i'm alive again .
i feel like crying .
thank you .
i should have come here earlier if this was the case .
i thought you were angry with me .
she tricked me !
you dare to decieve me !
remember this !
you cowards !
you're not going to get me !
takezo !
be silent !
we've captured your sister ...
and are holding her in your place ! and are holding her in your place !
what?
my sister !
my sister !
come down !
if you surrender , we'll let her go free .
my sister's done no wrong !
it's not fair !
it's not fair !
want to see her?
then , come down and surrender yourself !
damn you !
who would fall for that? !
i'll come for her for sure !
what are you waiting for?
after him !
yes , sir !
yes , sir !
dammit !
what are you going to do?
damn you !
takezo is here !
villagers !
why are you afraid of me?
i'm not a beast !
i'm not a beast !
wait !
wait !
why run?
you know who i am?
okay .
then answer me !
okay !
i'll do anything !
please spare me !
who said i would kill you?
do you know where my sister is?
well?
i don't know .
i don't know anything .
wait !
wait !
ok !
i'll tell you .
where is my sister?
which jail?
hinagura stockade !
the rumors say she's there .
what !
hinagura stockade?
damn them !
be gone !
he's been murdered !
uh , otsu san?
you look pale .
you look pale .
i saw a dead body on the roadside .
he'll be killed if he doesn't .
it's a vicious circle !
but , no one will attack you , so you don't need to worry about dying in vain .
oh , a letter was delivered for you .
for me?
to otsu , miyamoto village
from matahachi and oko
from oko ...
seems like he had someone write this .
you may have heard this news from others .
however , i am writing this to formally notify you ... that we have established a relationship with matahachi .
we have adopted him into our family .
you may have been worried .
from now on , you should forget about him .
these are the reasons i have written to you .
sincerely .
from oko to otsu san ...
he couldn't bring himself to write to his granny ... so he wants you to relay to her that he's living elsewhere .
that fool !
hey , otsu san ...
this is fortunate for you .
why?
if you became his wife ... and he sent this letter , what would you do then?
if i were you , i would be happy .
but , a woman cannot think like that .
then , how would you handle it?
i want to find matahachi san ... and scold him !
takuan san !
otsu !
otsu , are you in?
there you are .
oh , hello there .
otsu , the officer is demanding to see you .
he's doesn't want to drink alone .
he wants the usual hostess .
please !
suppress your feelings ... and please go entertain him .
okay?
please go .
okay?
okay?
hey there !
priest !
oh !
there you are !
here !
come closer !
oh !
you sure are playing hard to get !
come sit here and relax .
can you pour me a drink?
hey priest !
go away !
i don't want you around .
no , i like it here .
i can't relax with you reading here .
very well .
i'll close my book .
it's not the book !
it's you !
go away !
otsu san , this man wants to be left alone .
you love loneliness ...
such a noble trait .
okay .
we should not get in his way .
okay .
we should not get in his way .
fool !
who said that you could take otsu? !
i just want you to leave .
how insulting !
are you angry?
it's been twenty days and you still can't capture takezo .
do you think you can cut takuan's head off?
you've asked for it !
you've asked for it !
you will?
how interesting .
when you do ... bring my head to your lord , ikeda terumasa of himeji castle .
he'll say , " takuan , why is only your head here?
what?
what?
you're his retainer , but you haven't heard?
terumasa and i are very good friends .
even studied zen together .
please !
you compelled the farmers to help you . the more selfish you become !
now you're after otsu ...
if terumasa hears of this , you must commit seppuku .
please don't tell !
aoki dono ...
i'll feel sorry if i leave you depressed .
i'll get takezo for you within three days .
what?
you think i'm kidding?
no , but ...
but what?
including officers , footsoldiers and farmers ...
about 200 men search the mountain daily . about 200 men search the mountain daily .
how touching !
it's spring .
the mountains are filled with food .
for takezo , it is most convenient .
well , do you want to wait for snow?
we can't do that !
we can't do that !
you can't?
which is why i am offering to capture takezo for you .
i don't need help .
i can manage alone .
otsu and i will suffice .
you're joking !
however ...
i have a condition !
what's the condition?
what's the condition?
about takezo's treatment after i capture him ...
takuan will handle it .
i can't do that ...
i can't do that ...
you can't?
very well .
if you capture him , you can decide takezo's punishment .
however ...
if you can't capture him within three days ...
what will you do?
what will you do?
i will hang myself on the 1, 000 year old cedar .
what?
hang yourself?
otsu san ...
watch out for the thorns .
they placed these here to trap takezo san , didn't they?
yes .
takuan san ...
why do the villagers despise takezo so much?
some force must make them that way .
it's something no one can see .
is it inside a man's heart?
but takezo is also at fault .
unless he kills one after another ... he can't safeguard his life .
no one brought this misfortune to him .
his ignorance is to blame .
takuan san , do you also hate takezo san?
of course !
i can't ignore a man who treats life so lightly .
is that why ...
that's why i took on this responsibility .
leaving a man like takezo on the loose ... means lives may be lost daily .
would you not agree , otsu san?
i wish to know why he chose to return here ... despite all the danger .
that is all?
that is all?
also , what kind of woman matahachi is with?
i want to hear that from takezo san .
i see ...
that may help you give him up ...
but it may work otherwise , too .
listen , otsu san ...
i thought you would be the one person who would not know the darkness of humanity .
you would grow up ... get married ... but always live a life as beautiful as a flower .
it's getting late .
it's getting late .
yes , it is .
it's nearly time .
what are you looking at?
he should be appearing soon .
you mean takezo san?
yes .
yes .
who would come to get captured?
no , no ...
you're wrong .
men's hearts are very weak .
they cannot bear to be alone .
watch what happens .
takezo may be ...
however , he can't decide ...
poor soul , he can't even call out .
feeling suspicous , his mean eyes may be glaring at us .
takuan san ...
what is it?
today is the third day ...
if we cannot capture takezo san tonight ...
i know .
if it goes wrong ...
i'll just have to hang myself .
don't worry .
i don't intend to die yet .
then , why don't you go looking for him?
i wouldn't be able to find him ... not in these hills .
hey , otsu san ... that flute you keep in your sash .
will you play that for me?
my flute?
any tune will do .
any tune will do .
but ...
no one is around .
don't feel restrained .
okay , let me hear it .
takuan san , only for you ...
thank you .
you there ...
it must be cold out there in the fog .
takuan san ... why are you talking to yourself?
can't you tell , otsu san?
look , takezo is there .
wait !
why do you run?
come !
come here .
we have sake and food here .
i am neither friend nor foe .
come near the fire and warm up .
sit here .
serve takezo , too .
this is delicious .
takezo ... stop after the second bowl .
eating all at once may kill you .
otsu san ...
yes?
why are you here?
actually , we're here to capture you .
i know that .
i know that .
did you?
you came knowing that?
very well .
takezo , if you must face the law ...
wouldn't you rather be subjected to the law of buddha?
huh?
there is the law of the clan .
but buddha's teachings are also law .
both are valid laws ... but my law is more humane in treatment .
no thanks !
no thanks !
listen !
i can understand ... why you are fighting until the end .
but can you win?
huh?
huh?
win?
win what?
win what?
i mean win over yourself .
worse comes to worse ...
i'll kill myself .
that granny hon'iden ...
i will kill them all !
what about your sister?
the one who's been imprisoned?
fool !
takezo !
you may escape if you want ... but what will happen to your sister .
how will you face your ancestors?
and how far do you think you can run?
it's takezo !
hey !
takezo's been captured !
who did it !
who did it?
takuan sama and otsu did it !
his luck ran out !
his luck ran out !
murderer !
you killed villagers !
we've captured takezo !
we've captured takezo !
takezo !
you killed my brother !
hey !
return my brother alive !
that's right !
kill him !
kill him !
wait !
wait !
don't be hasty !
takezo's tied up and can't get away .
now , starting today ... you can forget hunting and return to farming .
now , i have to ask you for advice .
what?
what shall we do with takezo?
should we kill him or let him go?
what good would it do letting a man like him go free?
villagers !
let me speak !
let me speak !
i can't be satisfied with just killing him !
takuan dono , matahachi's future ... was ruined by him !
the hon'iden family lost their precious heir .
matahachi ...
he was already good for nothing .
it might be better that you adopt a son in law .
what a thing to say !
he is the enemy of the son whom i bore !
please leave it to me how to handle takezo !
no !
no !
no !
takezo is a straggler from sekigahara .
the government should have the final say !
that's not right ...
you made a promise .
takuan dono , the government will reward you for this .
but i will take custody of takezo .
what's so funny?
what's so funny?
mustache man ... you intend to break your promise as a samurai?
very well .
takuan captured takezo ... and i'll release him ...
wait !
afraid?
no sense in letting a captured man free .
i'll let you kill that man ... but hand over his head to me .
what?
his head?
what?
his head?
that's right !
you must be kidding?
priests tend to funerals .
if you take his body ...
i will lose my livelyhood .
besides , this granny here ... doesn't want him dead so fast .
i know .
why don't we hang takezo from this tree and expose him to the wind and and the rain ... and let the crows feed on his eyes?
that's great !
takuan dono , it's a wonderful idea .
after that , i will finish him off with the final blow .
okay , it's decided !
bring the ropes !
remember this !
takuan , it's unfair !
remember !
remember !
villagers !
remember !
takuan !
unfair !
takuan , it's unfair !
good for him !
good for him !
otsu , for capturing takezo ...
i thank you !
sir , a messenger is here .
what is it?
what is it?
aoki dono , it's a message from the lord .
thank you .
hey !
guard , keep a close watch .
yes , sir !
yes , sir !
very well .
otsu , are you one of them?
otsu ... you must be tired .
well , let me think ...
since i hear this from takezo ...
i hear matahachi is ...
living in another province .
in any case , you are matahachi's fiancee .
the temple priest ... has blessed this union for the hon'iden family .
whatever happens ...
yes .
yes .
you're sure?
yes .
yes .
i'm relieved to hear that .
however , society is critical ...
if matahachi doesn't return for a while ... it's inconvenient for me .
why don't you leave the temple ... and move to the hon'iden residence?
well ...
you want me?
who else will marry matahachi .
you are the one .
as for takezo's case ...
i somehow cannot understand priest takuan's true motives .
fortunately , you are here at the temple .
until takezo is dead ...
please stay here and keep an eye on him .
then ...
i don't have to leave the temple as of yet?
you can't do two jobs at once .
you will come to the hon'iden house the very same day ... that takezo's head ... is separated from his body .
understood?
this is an order .
granny , where did you go?
show your face !
villagers , remember this !
granny , how dare you trick me !
remember this !
remember this !
i will !
no way could i forget this !
i'll remember it for seven lives .
return matahachi !
like he was before !
shut up !
matahachi is alive !
he's not dead !
otsu dono?
otsu dono?
aoki dono?
aoki dono?
hello , otsu dono .
i received a directive from the lord .
but , i can guess the reason .
he wants an explanation about the recent trouble .
if i have takezo's head , i could make excuses ... but i am no match for that priest takuan !
alright , otsu !
you must be my ally now .
understand?
i'll give you this letter .
he's gone ...
that fool !
it's heavy .
it's money .
that's a large sum .
tear up the letter and throw it away .
it's okay .
takuan just got the buddha's permission .
take it with you .
go on .
it's raining .
damn you !
listen to him !
takuan !
takuan !
i want to talk to you !
come out !
come out , takuan !
takuan , come out !
it's not like you to give up .
what is it , takezo?
what is it , takezo?
listen !
if i only i had known this would happen !
it's too late now !
i surrendered myself ... because you tricked me .
i didn't think such a thing would happen !
if i die , i want to be killed by a priest !
it was a mistake to surrender myself to you !
was that your only mistake?
it's more like everything was a mistake .
shut up !
i'm not ashamed of what i did !
i knew granny loved matahachi very much !
that's why i risked my life to return and give granny that message !
just because i lost in battle , is this the treatment i get? !
never mind those trivial things .
damn you !
look at the vastness of the world from up there .
no , you may not have enough time?
when you go to the next world , your parents will be ... overjoyed that takuan taught you a good lesson .
takuan san , you're being too cruel !
so cruel !
so cruel !
sympathizing with him?
mercy !
please have mercy !
it's started raining hard .
this looks like a big storm .
otsu , because you cried , the sky is also crying .
i better leave now .
i never thought i would end like this !
i wanted to die in a fair fight !
i don't even know my sister's whereabouts !
father ...
mother ...
i am so vexed !
is takezo still alive?
oh , granny .
wasn't that a terrible storm last night?
wasn't that a terrible storm last night?
but such a good storm .
even a hard rain ... would take more than a day or two to kill a man .
look at him !
he's hanging there like a rag !
since i see no crows pecking at his face ...
i assume that his body is still warm .
i'm alive !
no way i'm dying !
no way i'm dying !
you devil !
you're a stubborn one !
you're all beasts disguised as humans !
otsu san !
i'm going crazy !
i'm going crazy !
takezo san !
takezo san !
takezo san !
takezo .
takezo !
takuan !
takuan !
you corrupt priest !
from that voice , i assume you will live another five or six days .
damn priest !
hurry up and behead me !
no , i can't behead you so easily . but you would still attack us knowing your personality .
i'll break these ropes ... and kill you soon !
just wait !
how promising !
i will wait for you then .
but maybe your life might end before that .
damn you !
you can move the tree !
but you can't affect the ground below ...
or the heaven above .
being ignorant , you can't even shake loose a cedar leaf .
damn you !
takezo .
why didn't you use your strength and youth more constructively?
you were born a human ... yet you live like the lions and the wolves .
you've never seen the light of your intellect .
now , that light may die here .
shut up !
listen to me , takezo .
i'll bet ... you thought no one was stronger than you .
but look at you now !
how miserable !
i never lose when it comes to strength !
whether you lose in strength or wits , you still lost .
as proof , i am the victor sitting on this rock ... and you are suffering miserably ... hanging above my head !
what is the difference?
you're lecturing me? !
how shameless !
however strong , a beast is still a beast ...
less than human .
how pitiful .
you know not the light of wisdom .
a man's true strength is not what you possess .
takezo !
give it good thought one more night .
i'll cut your head off anytime you want .
wait !
wait !
what?
what?
let me down !
what did you say?
i want to live again .
i want to start all over .
i don't want to die yet .
i beg you !
no !
in life , you can't start all over .
now you shed tears of repentance like a human .
so as to not make your dead face unsightly ...
pray to amida buddha and enjoy your last moments of life .
save me !
takezo san !
otsu san?
otsu san?
i'll come up to save you .
please wait .
run away , takezo san .
you're saving me?
you're saving me?
yes , i will .
please wait .
otsu san , it's dangerous .
otsu san , cut the rope !
just go ahead !
cut it !
cut it !
cut it !
hurry !
hurry !
i'm still alive !
i'm still alive !
otsu san !
are you all right?
are you all right?
please cut the ropes !
hold on to me !
otsu san .
otsu san .
the hinagura stockade is in this mountain range .
i hear my sister is being held there .
ogin sama?
ogin sama?
yes !
unless i go , her life will be endangered .
otsu san , wait here !
okay?
here?
where are we?
the top of mount nagayama .
over there is mount harima ... and on the left is mount himeji .
with each day that passes , it becomes more dangerour for her .
let me go .
please .
let me go to save my sister !
please !
takezo san , please go and save ogin .
you will let me go?
thank you !
don't worry about the rest .
i will go ahead to himeji castle town and wait for you .
yes , wait for me .
that's right !
please wait by hanada bridge where you can see the castle .
yes , i will wait for a hundred or even a thousand days .
a hundred or a thousand days ...
otsu san !
i will be sure to return to you .
by all means !
sister !
sister !
slster !
slster !
slster !
slster !
slster !
slster !
slster !
it's as you see .
priest takuan and otsu are gone .
what?
takuan , too?
then it must be their doing !
it must be them !
pursuit is not necessary !
i'll find them and punish the bad " bride to be " for this .
hanada bridge
what is wrong?
are you okay?
you don't feel well?
my goodness !
what a fever !
okay , come to my home .
you needn't hesitate .
grandma !
grandma !
hurry !
bring some water !
hurry !
hurry !
gon , before leaving home , i put on my ancestoral sash ... and before i left our gate , i vowed to our ancestors ... that i will punish my unfaithful daughter in law ... and determine if matahachi if dead or alive .
if he's alive , i will bring him home by the neck ... and get a better bride than otsu .
that will regain our family honor in the village .
here , have some cold water .
to hanada brldge
wait !
takuan !
takezo .
you scum priest !
how dare you trick me , you coward !
don't be so upset .
that was the only way i could save you from aoki tanzaemon .
making excuses !
i see ... but you'll see soon .
using the same tactics again to trick me !
don't get mad .
takezo ... about your sister ogin ...
what?
is my sister safe?
that's right .
takezo , follow me ...
where?
to my sister?
never mind where .
you'll let me see her?
yes , there is someone i would like you to meet .
what a dauntless expression !
the shinmen family were once vassals of the akamatsu clan .
the akamatsu clan were once the lords of this castle .
it must be fate that you were brought here .
takuan ...
aoki tanzaemon insists this man is trouble .
no .
if you investigate , you'll find the truth .
yes , i already have and i've learned of tanzaemon's viciousness .
then , will you allow me to handle him?
granted .
how will you handle him?
i heard that ghosts dwell within the attic of this castle .
i'm thinking of borrowing that room ... to confine takezo .
very well .
takezo ... these black lacquer like stains ... are all human blood .
your ancestors that lost this castle ...
the sad final blood of the akamatsu clan .
what?
you mean the same blood that flows through my body?
that's right .
the very same , takezo .
though it may be good blood ... unless it is polished , it rots and becomes the blood of a beast .
in the old days , great priests ... would isolate themselves and submerse themselves in literature . and gradually open up their mind's eye .
think of this room as your mother's womb ... and nurture your link to the past .
alright , takezo?
over there , you will find the writings of japanese and chinese scholars .
these scholars have greatly contributed to our culture .
it's up to you to make this a place of darkness ... or an enlightened place of learning .
alright ...
takezo !
takezo !
what will be the future of the akamatsu clan that led the great uprising?
look at the blood on the beam and look at the blood on the floor !
we have only faced defeat !
takezo !
that blood is still flowing within your body !
it's the akamatsu blood .
what do you want me to do?
the battle's over !
without a war to fight ... how do i live on?
takezo !
you know the answer !
make the most out of our remorses .
the dream of victory at sekigahara is over !
you're telling me to dream again? !
there are no more battles !
anywhere !
this is a nightmare !
we , the spirits condemed to hell , can never rest in peace .
the blood of akamatsu !
takezo !
takezo !
please purify it with the light of wisdom ...
the light of wisdom !
a tea scoo`p cannot be too thick or too thin .
it must endure heat and moisture , but remain graceful .
that's right .
bend it slowly .
give the handle a slight curve ... and create a deep roundness at the tip .
be slow .
be patient .
and don't force it .
too much at once makes a ladle brittle .
yes , that's right .
that's the way .
if only people's hearts were like this ladle ...
otsu san , if this takezo san is still alive ... he will come for you for sure .
yes .
a hundred or a thousand days ...
otsu san !
i will be sure to return to you .
takuan san !
how is your condition?
much better .
welcome .
otsu san is a great help to the business .
thank you for looking after her .
this is well made .
this is well made .
i can't do it very well yet .
oh !
you can clearly see the top of the castle today .
the birds are circling around ... and around ... and flying slowly ...
see anything else?
no , nothing .
you will see in time .
if you wait , you'll find out .
if you wait , you'll find out .
what will i find?
before today , my courage ...
the strength of a warrior is nothing like that .
one must be aware of the fearful ... and yearn to live ...
he must care about his life .
