your friend is late .
he'll be here .
oh , yeah?
i do have other bidders .
i personally vouch for this man .
oh , well , i trust you , michael , but ... yousee , with each degree of separation ... comes a degree of uncertainty .
mr. turner .
mr. vas .
the kgb once tried to set me up ... so i had to kill three of their agents ... and then i hunted down their families .
the point is , if i sense anything out of the ordinary ...
no , the point is , i haven't seen anything from youyet ... to justify a payment of $20 million .
so , before i hand over a small fortune ... and risk my life , i want to know 100 % ... that youcan , in fact , deliver the device .
that's the point .
very well .
michelle ... owner's manual .
this is your show of good faith?
well , you're still alive .
youconsider that a show of good faith .
what do youhave for me?
down payment $ 1 million .
so , when do i get the device?
let's say ten days .
michael , youtake that telephone ... and i will call you and tell youhow to proceed .
youkeep it on youall the time .
as for you , sir , the next time we meet ...
i suggest yoube on time .
nice coat .
well done .
see youaround .
so far , so good?
yeah , so far .
kevin's got a tail .
ls it vas?
they don't look russian , but they don't look friendly .
we'd better go back for him .
youordered us not to jeopardize our cover , sir .
hey , turn left .
turn left !
kill him !
ambush on the castle steps .
come on , faster . ...
let's go !
get down !
get down !
there he is !
pull over !
you're jeopardizing the mission .
youare the mission .
god , that was close .
did yousee who they were?
kevin?
doesn't this all smack of extreme desperation?
a nuclear bomb that fits neatly into a carry on suitcase?
kevin spends two years getting close to these people ... in order to position you as the buyer .
vas won't deal with anyone else ... and we have nine days to make this work .
i'd say desperation was the order of the day .
maybe vas set kevin up .
my guess is , it's a rival buyer .
could be pakistanis , chechnyans , north koreans .
libyans .
try the entire middle east .
adrik vas is a businessman .
he'll take anyone's money .
why kill kevin if they could just outbid him?
we have deeper pockets .
he priced them out of the game .
who do youthink it is?
well , the cold war is over .
these guys don't wave flags anymore ... and fanaticism , terrorism is global .
whoever it is decided to eliminate the competition ... and force vas to deal with them .
so , the future of the so called free world ... may rest in this young man's hands .

pleasure?
pain .
your sister put youup to this .
she never liked me .
it's been three years , jake .
i know it's been three years .
we're in the same situation that we were in when we met .
meaning , we're not married .
we're not married , we can't afford to get married .
and it doesn't look like it's ever gonna change .
youknow , poor people do get married .
i know , but i don't feel like fighting with you ... every day because we're broke .
marriage is hard enough without being poor .
hey , what happened to the love?
what happened to all that romance?
youknow i love you .
but youare living in this fantasy .
it's like you're waiting for some kind of miracle .
i gotta live in reality .
i am not gonna be young forever .

officer swanson , officer carew .
cla?
what's that for?
crackers in my ass?
you're gonna arrest me for scalpin 'tickets?
we just want to talk to you about something .
about what?
about your brother .
yougot the wrong guy .
i don't even have a brother .
that's just a picture of me in a suit .
youcould've got that off the internet .
i saw a picture of bill gates with three titties on the net .
ok , september 8 , 1970 ...
bellevue hospital , new york city ... a woman registered as mary jeffries ... gives birth to identical twins ... but suffers complications and dies the next day .
what about the father?
thomas b. jeffries .
presumed alive .
whereabouts unknown .
the state rarely separates twins ... but one of the infants jacob that's you ... was diagnosed with severe lung infection .
youstill have the scar from the chest tube ... the incision mark .
an administrator at the hospital altered the birth record ... to give the healthy child a better chance at adoption .
a week later , roger and glenda pope ... took in kevin jeffries .
the popes never knew .
kevin never knew .
so , i have a twin brother .
big deal .
what's the cla have to do with this?
he couldn't send me a letter?
your brother's dead .
how?
a helicopter crash .
we need your help , mr. hayes .
your brother was working on something with us .
my twin brother was cla?
yeah , a clandestine operative .
and just before he was killed , he set up a deal .
what kind of deal?
a very important one .
so , we need youto stand in for him , just briefly .
pretend i'm him?
yeah .
for how long?
nine days .
nine days is not standin 'in .
standin 'in is an hour .
nine days is goin 'on tour .
ls this shit dangerous?
there's some risk .
what kind of risk?
we talkin 'bad credit risk ... or a bullet in the ass risk?
you'd be well compensated .
for a bullet in the ass risk?
i hope that's a lot of compensation .
how much?
throw out a number .
a billion dollars .
you've overshot .
i don't know what kind of budget you're working with .
we were thinking somewhere in the region of ...
let's say ... $25, 000 .
fifty .
yeah , fifty .
i figure youstarted with 25 , so i know yougot more .
youain't gonna give me all your money .
50, 000 .
this is what i'm thinking , mr. hayes .
with $25, 000 , your girlfriend julie could go to college .
she wouldn't have to go to seattle .
or work with ken .
ok , here's what i'm thinkin '.
you're gonna give me $50, 000 tax free .
ok , 50, 000 after taxes after the job is done .
half now , half after .
ten now , forty after .
unless my mother had triplets ... you're gonna give me ten now , ninety after .
ok , yougot a deal .
so , when do we start?
now .
this is your brother's file .
study it .
this is your brother's file .
study it .
so there's homework .
preparation .
ok .
let's see , dad sits on the board of the new york stock exchange .
mom , co artistic director ... at lincoln center .
must've been nice .
in my foster house , we were so poor ... we used to lick stamps for dinner .
let's see .
prep school at exeter .
then college at dartmouth .
served in the naval academy .
that's right .
what'd he serve , lunch?
oh , man .
rhoades scholar .
so my brother was real smart?
yeah .
damn , the cla is cheap .
y'all could've got me a queen size .
what's this , jack size?
hey , what's " zchod " mean?
it's czech for " bathroom .
you'll find the room labelled with phonetic translations .
why?
because the deal goes down in the czech republic .
czech republic?
here's a dictionary .
how do i get an outside line?
i need somebody to feed my cat .
youdon't have an outside line or a cat .
so what am i supposed to be doing here?
there's a tape in the vcr .
it's a video of your brother .
watch it .
the way he talks and the way he moves .
i know there's a lot to deal with here ... but we're all behind you .
we'll start in the morning .
yougot any questions?
yeah , if my brother was such a genius ... then how come he's dead?
5 a. m. hey , i don't do 5 a. m.
so , bottom line , what are our chances?
i'd say anywhere between nil and zero .
why do yousay that?
i grant you , he's got potential .
he's pretty street smart .
in 6 months , he could probably fool his brother's parents .
but eight days?
yougotta be kidding .
probably get himself killed on this mission ... and anyone else who goes along with him .
would youlike to be replaced on the mission?
why?
you're going ahead with or without me?
that's precisely what i'm saying .
well , sir , when do i tell him what this mission involves?
if i were you , i would tell him as little as possible .
don't put anything into his head he can't use ... and certainly nothing that could pop out at the wrong time .
ok .
what's he doing now?
he's studying .
we told him to learn ... a few key phrases in czech .
he seems dedicated .
what's he saying?
he said , " i haven't had my period in three months .
now what?
where's the hospital?
i have a vaginal infection .
this is gonna be really interesting .
can't wait to get started .
rise and shine , mr. hayes !
5 a. m. , and all is well .
how about three more hours of sleep and some breakfast?
how about a nice shower?
aah !
aah !
hey !
what's wrong with you? !
good morning .
today we'll be covering basic operations protocol ... for the acquisition of foreign assets ... a procedure we like to call " the three i's " ... identifying the target , initiating the contact ... and infiltrating the network ...
now youdo it like him .
man , this is buggin 'me out .
i feel like michael jackson ...
lookin 'at old album covers .
look at this guy .
he looks like me , but it's not me .
yeah .
so , what did he like to do?
what kind of sports was he into?
what kind of music did he listen to?
he liked music .
jazz and classical .
classical , like run dmc?
he didn't like rap .
what 29 year old brother don't like a little bit of rap?
he didn't listen to rap .
so , what kind of sports was he into?
skiing .
ok , so yougot skiing , the navy , no rap .
we'd have had a lot in common .
sir .
hmm?
what time?
ok .
all right .
thanks .
so , what's up with youand swanson?
hmm?
aw , come on , man .
i see there's something goin 'on there .
yougot a little something goin 'on . ...
look at you .
you're blushing .
do youmind if i say something to you , mr. hayes?
my friends , officer seale , officer swanson ... they have faith in you .
i don't .
and that creates a problem ... because you're in so deep with us now ... we can never let yougo .
so you'd better learn this stuff ... stone cold by 0500 hours tomorrow morning .
or what?
i'll kill you .
can we start a few hours later tomorrow?
get dressed .
it's 4 : 59 !
swirl .
checking for sediment .
sniff ...
and taste .
morning , mr. hayes .
5 a. m.
no , 5 : 01 .
pope .
kevin pope .
ha ha ha !
look at this suit .
man , i got initials on my cuffs .
the only thing i ever have on my cuffs is steak sauce .
they say " m. t.
what's that for?
michael turner .
but i thought i was kevin pope .
kevin pope is michael turner .
michael turner is kevin pope's cover identity .
he is a very successful , very knowledgeable ... very sophisticated international dealer ... in fine antiquities .
well , if i'm jake hayes playing kevin pope ... playing michael turner , then i should get two checks .
cheers .
this is a very rare expensive cognac .
what do youthink?
dry .
but never precocious .
i love your shirt .
egyptian broadcloth?
three days .
pretty impressive .
yeah , he's bright .
i think he can do it .
he's got my vote .
i said he was bright .
i didn't say he was capable of saving the world .
let's run a real test .
like what?
send him up to new york .
put him in kevin's apartment .
let the neighbors , the doorman , everybody get a look at him .
see if they buy him as michael turner .
might even serve a double purpose .
whoever tried to kill kevin as michael turner ... probably doesn't know he's dead .
might still be looking for him .
so we dangle him as bait , keep him in the dark .
he'll be protected .
what do we tell him?
you're giving him a chance to practice being kevin .
that's all youneed to tell him .
you're the boss .
yousee the van in front of us?
the one behind us?
those are our guys .
here's my cell phone number .
use it if youget into any kind of trouble .
what kind of trouble?
any kind .
shark attack?
call you .
all right .
could youpop the trunk?
take this .
get yourself some shoes .
little punk .
mr. turner , welcome back , sir .
thanks , jim .
how was europe?
like another country .
youcould put this on mtv cnribs .
man , this is dope !
god damn .
so if i paid taxes ... this is where the money would go , huh?
could have a puffy party in here .
let's get some music in here .
whoa oh oh !
what's that music?
just hip hop stuff .
it's terrible .
jake , it's your downstairs neighbor ...
mrs. patterson .
don't forget the radio .
ok .

mwah .

what more do youwant?
oakes , we need to know who's after that bomb .

well , what are youdoing in the dark?
some people are looking for me .
what did youdo?
i didn't do nothin '!
it's not what youthink .
it's not the police .
it's way too hard to explain .
look at this .
eight foster kids i've taken into my house over the years ... and all of them made something of themselves ... and not one of them had your potential !
oh , come on , ma !
sellin ', scramblin 'and hustlin '.
ma , did youknow i had a brother?
stop talking crazy .
youhad lots of brothers .
how's that nice girl i met last christmas?
she left me .
hand me that umbrella so i can hit youagain .
youknow , ma , maybe it wasn't my fault?
youneed money?
no .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah , i need money .
how much do youneed?
i won $250 at bingo .
it's just for a little while .
i'll pay youback .
i know .
want something to eat?
youknow what?
i really gotta go .
i'm never giving up on you , jakey .
you're going to do something to make me very proud one day .
i know it .
i owe youan apology .
youhear me?
i was just wondering how many of your people are listening in .
we're alone .
no cameras , no wires .
just me .
yougot the floor .
your brother was assassinated .
by the same guys who came after me , right?
i guess so .
doing the same job as you .
which is what?
your brother , as michael turner ... was helping me buy something off the black market .
what?
cuban cigars?
playstation 3?
what?
i can't tell youif you're not coming back in with us .
i'm not comin 'back in if youain't telling me .
your brother died saving my life .
did youknow that?
wish it had been otherwise , but that's the way it is .
how are his parents taking it?
youdidn't tell his parents?
no .
that's the way we want it .
how would youfeel if youdied and nobody told your wife?
i'm not married .
there's no mrs. spy?
not anymore .
relationships and attachments are useless in this business .
so that's how this job is .
even if they don't shoot you , they take your life . ...
i know it sounds hokey , but i honestly believe ... our lives are about something bigger than ourselves ... and i'm offering youa chance to commit yourself to something .
youain't offering me nothin '... but a chance at a bullet in my ass .
i don't see the higher meaning in that .
tell youwhat i'm gonna do .
thank you .
no problem .
i'll go and sit in the car and count to ten ... and if youwant to join me , fine , and if not ...
i'll tell the agency i couldn't find you .
we can't pull this job off without you .
we need you .
tch .
think about it .
oh , well .
that didn't work , did it?
no .
i'm gonna go outside and count to ten "?
who the hell are you?
you'd have done better with " bitch , get in the car .
ok .
get in the car ... bitch .
this is the man who tried to kill you .
we now know that he's a member of a multi national ... terrorist organization led by this man .
meet the man who killed your brother ...
dragan adjanic .
he's wanted by the hague for terrorist crimes ... against humanity , so he's a fugitive ... everywhere in the world , including his own country .
he calls his movement " the black hand .
his members take a death pledge ... becoming suicide soldiers to further their cause .
last year , the fbi caught four of his men ... in a washington , d. c. motel ... with enough urea nitrate to level the capitol building .
he doesn't like america and he doesn't like you .
wait a minute .
what did i do?
he's your rival buyer .
for the item that this man has to sell .
now , this is adrik vas .
he's a russian ex army colonel , kingpin in the russian mafia .
up to his neck in prostitution , drugs , and extortion .
sounds like anybody i went to high school with .
this is vas's right hand man .
his name is michelle petrov ... otherwise known as " the hammer .
remember these faces ... because you're going to be seeing them soon .
why do they call this guy the hammer?
aah !
wha what? !
good evening .
isn't this fun?
this is an exercise known as king's game .
it's meant to test your awareness .
what can youtell me about your attackers?
they woke me up .
look , man , if youwant me to spy ...
i'm gonna need my rest .
how many were there?
didn't i just say they woke me up? !
that's the weird thing about an ambush .
next time we'll try and warn you .
do youunderstand what happened to youjust now?
yeah .
i was jacked !
no , youpanicked .
when youthought youwere in danger , your brain shut down .
so what's the point of having a good brain ... if youcan't keep it operating?
my brain didn't shut down .
i knew it was swanson ...
'cause i could feel her tits on my back .
i knew it was carew 'cause his breath smelled like shit .

based on our intelligence projections ... and the text manual provided by agent pope ... this is a mock up of what you'll be buying .
does it play dvds?
it's a portable thermonuclear weapon .
so that's a bomb?
it's a reproduction .
last year , a russian suitcase bomb ... was stolen from a dismantling facility in the ural mountains .
your brother tracked it down , we need youto recover it .
two things you're gonna have to do ...

her name is lenka .
youjust called her " lempenka , " which means " cardboard .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
man , it's gonna be hard to go back to jersey .
we'll be in the suite across the hall ... with full video and audio surveillance of this room .
all right , now , when i go to the bathroom ... press the pause button .
just stay in the room .
you've got nothing to worry about .
except for my little date with a nuclear bomb .
ok , this is our lifeline .
our only link to adrik vas .
nothing happens till he calls .
don't let it out of your sight .
and remember , from now on , there's no jake ... there's no kevin , only michael turner .

all right .
from this point on ... only youwill be able to access your computer .
it won't operate without your retinal signature ... your eyes so when they show you the bomb , connect your laptop ... determine if the bomb is the real thing ... and take enough time doing it ... so wells candownload tlheinranrming codes ... and lhopefully tlheinrdisanrming codes ... into ounrcomputenr .
good luck .
mnr .
hayes .

you'll do fine .
everyone's nervous the first day of school .

don't worry .
you're covered from every angle .
i can't wait to meet " the hammer .
oh , these guys must be " the toolbox .
should we move in , sir?
no .
not until we're sure they brought the bomb .
there's too much at stake .
nice coat .
gentlemen , are we going to do business or aren't we?
depends , michael .
where have youbeen for the last nine days?
i don't believe that concerns you .
on the contrary .
it concerns me very much .
we make a deal , youdisappear .
doesn't look good , my friend .
heads up , mccain .
be advised , targets are armed .
maintain your positions .
everyone maintain your position .
copy that , sir .
do we have a problem?
i don't know .
youtell me .
do we have a problem?
do we?
give me the cell phone i gave youearlier .
don't worry .
i only made collect calls .
look , i don't know what this is about , but ...
no , youdon't , so shut up .
neither does mr. turner .
yousee , this cell phone has a global positioning system .
in a moment , it'll tell me exactly where you've been ... the last nine days .
fantastic , eh?
well , haven't youbeen busy?
oh , youget around .
berlin , rome , zurich .
heh .
and not one decent treasure to show for it .
now , where's the money?
where's the product?
nearby .
so , how do we do this?
i'm gonna call you on this cell phone ... then youhave one hour to get the money , michael .
then i'll call youagain and tell you ... where to bring it to .
youunderstand?
i'm gonna have to run some tests ... so make sure youbring authentic merchandise .
fair enough .
i wouldn't buy a car ... without checking under the hood .
ha !
are we agreed?
yes .
no .
we're not bringing money anywhere .
no?
i'll have someone transfer the remaining 19 million ... when mr. turner tells us we have a viable device .
it'll be done by computer .
one of my men will be standing by at this address .
youwill send one of your brain trusts ... to verify the money is in your account , and that's it .
give youa hostage?
and youget one .
we'll call it a security deposit ... which neither of us will get back if we screw up ... or if we leave a mess .
it's that simple .
now we have an agreement , i think .
agreed .
don't yougo disappearing on me again , michael .
hey , youdid real well , mr. hayes .
hey , youdid real well , mr. hayes .
youknew they wouldn't bring it , right?
uh huh .
standard procedure .
guys like him won't risk ... getting screwed on the first date .
what if youhadn't changed the chip in the phone?
it would have told him that the phone had already ... traveled to cla headquarters in langley ... and they would have shot both of us in the heads .
i'm hungry .
how about you?
i'm gonna pass .
then good night .
oh !
michael !
hi .
this place comes with everything , huh?
could youget me a towel?

ahem .

i didn't think you'd be shocked .

i'd like a good stiff drink .

that's michael's girlfriend .
she works for cnn in europe .
so how come didn't youtell me michael had a girlfriend?
well , they broke up several weeks ago .
they had a fight , and she walked out .
well , it looks like she forgave him .
what the hell did he fight with her fine ass for?
well , apparently he had intimacy problems .
he was distant , some kind of psychotherapy crap .
anyway , she went off to cover the balkans .
ok , so what do you want me to do?
take her to dinner .
she's cnn .
if youhandle this badly , she could blow your cover .
