# through early morning fog i see
# visions of the things to be
# the pains that are withheld for me
# i realise and i can see
# that suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# the game of life is hard to play
# i'm gonna lose it anyway
# the losing card i'll someday lay
# so this is all i have to say
# suicide is painless
# suicide
# it brings on many changes
# changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# the sword of time will pierce our skins
# it doesn't hurt when it begins
# but as it works its way on in
# the pain grows stronger , watch it grin
# suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# a brave man once requested me
# to answer questions that are key
# is it to be or not to be?
# and i replied " oh , why ask me?
# suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# and you can do the same thing
# if you please

i just got into town and , uh , ... ... well , i thought maybe you could show me around .

captain pierce , did you call me?

i don't drink .
jesus christ , i think he means it .
i think we've been had , hawkeye .
i think you're right .
i don't think it's right to involve a boy who's not 17 years old yet .
you go to sleep now?
yeah .
i go wash clothes .
ok .
you make a mean martini there , ho jon .
you keep it up , you hear?
our father , who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come .
thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven .

and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil .
for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory , for ever and ever .
amen .
amen .
amen .
god , protect our men on the field of battle , that they may return home to their dear ones .
and , dear god , protect our supreme commander on the field ... ... and our commander in chief in washington dc .
frank , were you on this religious kick at home or did you crack up over here?
frank , how long does this show go on?
it gets longer all the time .
now i have your soul to pray for and captain pierce's .
# onward , christian soldiers
# marching as to war
# with the cross of jesus
# going on before
# christ , our royal master
# leads against the foe
# forward into battle
# see his banners go
# onward , christian soldiers
# marching as to war
# with the cross of jesus
# going on before
yeah?
what's the line up?
four waiting for surgery , two for the iv and two for the antibiotics to take over .
we can probably handle that if there's no more choppers .
pickup .
scissors .
you can't go in the colonel's office .
that's who we're lookin 'for .
henry , you gotta do something .
we have stuck it out for a week .
pretty girl .
yeah , she kinda grows on you .
what is it , men?
that sky pilot .
get him out of our tent .
your tent?
yeah .
get that nurse in there .
she won't keep us awake all night praying .
i've been here a long time .
i know what you're trying to pull , but you won't push me around .
not for the world would i push you around , but , look , there is one more thing .
we need a chest cutter .
we need a good one , or there'll be trouble .
no mash unit has a chest surgeon .
we won't get one .
sir , they're behind in the or and the pre op ward is jammed up .
the helicopters and ambulances are coming in full .
you have to work early today .
and add overtime to a 12 hour day?
the union'll raise cain with you .
with those hours , you need rest .
you can't get it with burns jabbering to god .
burns will go in 24 hours .
tell them captain pierce and captain forrest are on the way .
henry , there's one more thing .
i told you major burns will go in 24 hours .
the chest cutter .
no .
i'll try .
you can't ask more than that .
my operation was fine .
it's the head wound that did him in .
dish , get over here and hold this retractor .
dish , let me have a long needle holder .
dago !
amen .
pull it back , duke .
hell , i can't .
get hold of the other one .
dago , i want you to hold this retractor .
now .
please , come on .
now .
yes .
i'm sorry .
hi , dago .
hold on .
don't wiggle it .
just hold on .
clamp .
sorry , dago , but this man's still alive and that other man is dead , and that's a fact .
can you hold it with two fingers , dago?
hell , did you see it?
where's hawkeye?
you mean captain pierce?
no , i'd have to look at the duty roster .
they're in there .
oh , man .
hawkeye , you gotta remember , i'm married .
i'm married .
i love my wife .
if she was here , i would be with her .
there is no question of loving anybody .
it is a question only of helping ...
you see , i made a vow to myself ... ... that while i was gone i was gonna be faithful to my husband .
those are vows you make when you're with somebody .
hawkeye?
ho jon?
duke say you better haul ass home quick .
we got new chest cutter in our tent .
ok .
this is radio tokyo bringing you musical interlude for your enjoyment .
that's him .

oh , yeah?
yeah .
and that's all .
well , listen , uh ... ... where were you when you were drafted?
i was just curious .

i told you before .
no , i mean , what were you doin '?
were you like a resident or on staff some place?
hm .
where?
hospital .
which hospital?
back home .
some reason i shouldn't know which hospital?
i don't know .
i will ask .
is there some reason my friend should not know the name of the hospital?
there doesn't appear to be any reason .
i've seen you somewhere before .
i don't know your name , stranger , but your face is familiar .
have you always had that moustache?
are you a beer drinker , or would you like to share a martini?
martini .
that would be ...
i'd love a martini .
ho jon , give the gentleman a martini .
i think you will find these accommodating .
they're quite dry .
don't you use olives?
olives?
where the hell d'you think you are?
we do have to make concessions to the war .
we're three miles from the front line .
yes , but a man can't really savour his martini without an olive , you know .
otherwise , you see , itjust ... ... doesn't quite make it .
attention .
the evangelical united brethren church has donated 34 hymnals ... ... to the 4077th mash unit .

i think he has !
nurse , i need a suture .
coming .
keep ahead of him , babe .
we need a couple more stitches in there .
that's fine , yeah .
thank you .
it's a good thing you have a nice body , nurse , or we'd get rid of you .
don't stick me .
keep it clean .
i can tie that for you .
let's have the big stitches for holding up the chest .
larger needles , knocko .

i could use another one .

i just wanted to make sure you had time to sleep this off .
son of a bitch !
trapper !
captain mclntyre !
what the hell ...?
that's a captain?
what's going on?
who started this?
i hit him !
he's an ignoramus , that knucklehead !
he wouldn't have touched me if i'd had my guard up .
let us settle this , colonel , between ourselves .
alone !
think this is an english boarding school?
mclntyre , you're under arrest .
confine yourself to quarters .
henry , are you kidding?
i deeply regret this unfortunate incident .
we try to remember we're a military organisation .
i should certainly hope so .
vollmer , that man is under arrest .
confine him to his quarters .
captain mclntyre , you are officially ...
come on .
cut it out , vollmer .
attention , camp compound .
urine specimens will be required from all pers ... uh ...
disregard last transmission .
sorry , colonel .
what the hell's the matter with you?
want some coffee?
please .
ho jon , some coffee .
what's wrong with you?
i don't know .
i must have lost my punch .
i never expected the son of a bitch to get up !
that's no kind of an answer .
you know why he did it .
i can't have my junior officers striking each other .
dammit , henry .
frank burns is a menace !
every time a patient croaks on him he says it's god's will or somebody else's fault .
this time he blamed it on some kid who was stupid enough to believe him .
i'm tired of you trying to run this outfit .
there's going to be disciplinary action .
what are you gonna do , henry?
i'd planned to name trapper chief surgeon ... ... to consult on your shift and frank's .
that's damn good thinking .
but now i can't do it for at least a week .
if i announced it now after what our new chief nurse saw , she'd yell to washington .
don't you have any sugar in this place?
good morning .
today's musical selections will be rendered by ... ...
achi takamura seamuchiwa bobcats .
colonel blake , general hammond did not answer the phone .
he was at a football game .
those generals have all the fun !
yes , sir .
attention .
attention .
may i have the camp's attention?
this week's movie will be " when willie comes marching home " .
uh , the biggest parade of laughs of world war il .
all the loves , laughs and escapades of the willies who came marching home .
this film stars dan dailey , corinne calvet and colleen townsend .
captain pierce , may i join you?
you've already joined me , gorgeous .
you're a sight for sore eyes .
where do you come from?
well , i like to think of the army as my home .
oh , yeah?
yeah?
ho jon , bring me some ketchup .
i've been observing the nurses on your shift .
i know .
naturally , your own opinion is more informed than mine .
you want to know what i think of the nurses on my team .
i'll tell you .
i think they're fine , just great .
i'm totally satisfied with them .
oh , no , that's the second time this week .
of course , what do you expect?
welcome , gentlemen .
# when the lights go on again
# all over the world
you got enough room?
is he all right , hawkeye?
is he all right , dago?
yes , you mean is he gonna live?
he'll live .
i hope somebody's gonna be around tomorrow morning when he wakes up ... ... to tell him that he hasn't got anything between his legs any more .
syngman rhee paid the light bill .
major burns is far from satisfied .
that doesn't surprise me .
frank burns does not know his way around an operating theatre .
he does not know his way around a body .
and if you'll have observed anything , you'll have observed that frank burns is an idiot .
he has flipped his wig , he is out of his head , he's a lousy surgeon .
on the contrary , i have observed that major burns is not only a good technical surgeon , ... ... he is a good military surgeon .
you finished?
i have also noticed that nurses as well as enlisted men address you as " hawkeye " .
because that's my name .
hawkeye .
that kind of informality is inconsistent with maximum efficiency .
oh , come off it , major !
you've put me off my fried lobster .
do you realise that?
i'm gonna go back to my bed , i'm gonna put away the best part of a bottle of scotch ... ... and under normal circumstances , you being normally what i'd call attractive , ... ... i would have invited you back to share my little bed with me and you might have come .
but you really put me off .
i mean , you're what we call a regular army clown .
i wonder how such a degenerate ... ... could have reached a position of responsibility in the army .
he was drafted .
radar !
your briefcase , sir .
you're going to see hammond .
i'm spending the day with hammond .
major burns is in charge .
major burns is in charge .
good luck .

radar has all the information .
but who's gonna be on cq tonight?
wait a minute .
what about the ...?
oh , captain .
yes , sir .
i have some shirts with the buttons missing .
ask satsumi to sew them on , please .
i'd be glad to do them .
you don't have to .
it's nothing .
nice jacket .
is it new?
oh , yeah .
my , uh ...
it was sent to me .
you don't have to do that .
take care .

radar's gonna sing us our verse .
this letter has been written in the interest of army morale .
we feel it is our duty to bring this unwholesome situation to your attention .
we write this jointly to assure you no one's personal feeling has influenced this report .
respectfully , margaret j houlihan , major burns .
that's perfect .
i think it's a marvellous letter .
we make a good team , don't we?
we think the same way .
of course we do .
it's almost suppertime .
you're not hungry , are you?
ravenous .
how about you?
for you , margaret .
now , the sooner this reaches him , the sooner we can turn this into a tight military outfit .
attention , camp compound .

i only wish i could deliver that letter personally .
good night , frank .
good night , margaret .
i'll stop by later on to see if you're all right .
that won't be necessary .
no , i don't mind .

what makes me sore is how they behave towards you .
they oughta be grateful to have you .
i certainly am .
i'm grateful to have you , frank .
we've grown very close in a short time .
it isn'tjust chance .
i'm sure of that .

oh , oh , frank .
oh , frank , strangle me hard .
frank !
oh !
what the hell is that?
oh !
oh , yes .
oh !
dr frank burns is doing a bit of dilatation and curettage .
that's a ...
that's a ...
sounds like the major's having a dream .
she's plugged in .
oh , major .
oh , frank .
frank .
wait a second .
what is it?
turn the light off !
no !
let go !
turn the light off !
get your clothes on !
get your pants on !
don't shout at me .
don't shove me .
too bad henry wasn't here .
he'd have thought it was a real radio programme .
i thought it was a radio programme .
we should send a letter of commendation to the armed forces radio network .
ah , wonderful .
yes .
it was the most uplifting programme i have ever heard .
it was climactic .
morning , ladies .
well , hiya , hot lips .
oh .
oh , my goodness , over my ...
i'm so sorry to touch you , but i ...
what's up with her today?
i think it's one of those ladies 'things .
it's not like her to act like this .
she's made a ...
bitch .
look at my new flannel sweater .
she's gonna have a nervous breakdown .
she can't even get outta the door .
morning , frank .
heard from your wife?
colonel , you forgot your briefcase .
i left it in the jeep .
you left it there .
oh , yes .
i forgot it .
morning , captain .
i hope you didn't have to ...
take care of this .
i hope you didn't have to bother with those shirts .
it wasn't necessary .
too late , sir .
it's a done thing .
well , thank you .
morning , padre .
you know , i really got ...
colonel , sir .
how was your visit , sir?
great .
the general wasn't there .
oh .
listen , about last night , sir , there was nothing i could do about it , sir .
nothing?
nothing .
well , it couldn't have been helped .
thank you , sir .
oh , what's that?
frank burns and hawkeye pierce .
very encouraging .
a bunch of the boys asked me to ask you what hot lips was like in the sack .
was she ...
mind your own business .
no , frank .
is she better than self abuse?
what's that all about?
he gonna get some pointers or somethin '?
no , hawkeye's gonna sign him up to make a personal appearance tour in all the camps .
is that a fact?
can you make out what they're saying?
does that big ass of hers move around a lot , frank , or does it sort of lie there flaccid?
um , hawkeye's questioning the major on a point of anatomy .
very professional .
would you say that she was a moaner , frank?
what is burns saying?
major burns isn't saying much of anything .
he's formulating the answer .
seriously , frank .
or does she lie there quiet and not do anything at all?
keep your filthy mouth to yourself .
oh !
oh !
get him off me !
get him off me !
frank , is that lesson one?
frank burns has gone nuts !
i'm wearing glasses , for god's sake !
watch out for your goodies .
he's a sex maniac .
i don't think hot lips satisfied him .
don't let him kiss you , hawkeye .
# the time has come for us
# to say sayonara
# my heart will always
# be yours for eternity
# i knew sometime we'd have to say sayonara ...
uh , colonel , fair's fair .
if i nail hot lips and punch hawkeye , can i go home?
# i'll remember our romance
# until the day that i die
# i'll see your face
# in the moon and stars in the sky
hawkeye !
be there in a minute .
hawkeye !
oh , shit .
ok .
seidman , get another guy .
we gotta take this into the or just on the stretcher .
hold on , you're gonna be just fine , fella .
ok .
i can't move my hand .
come on .
have you got the cutdowns?
you're gonna go to sleep .
you'll be fine .
hot lips , let me have a sterile knife .
i'm gonna need two vascular clamps ... ... and an arterial suture .
as soon as you give me the clamp i want you to gown and glove me .
all right?
ready?
ok .
here we go .
it's gonna spurt a bit .
ok .

ah , yeah , you baby .
clamp .
yeah .
ok , gown .
gloves .
you got an arterial suture ready?
yeah .
ok .
ugly , move out of the way cos i'm working over there .
baby , we're gonna see some stitching like you never saw before !
attention .
attention .
this is colonel blake's office .
the american medical association has just declared marijuana a dangerous drug .
despite earlier claims by physicians that it is no more harmful than alcohol , ... ... this is now found to be the case .
that is all .
when did you get them?
let me try it on you .
yeah?
yeah .
hey , dago reddo !
hi .
you're just in time for cocktails .
come on in .
uh , no , thank you .
i can't , really .
uh , hawkeye .
hawkeye .
ok , red .
could i speak to you?
yeah , sure .
no , outside .
what?
i have to talk to you outside .
hiya , pup pup .
sorry to drag you away from the gang , but ...
what?
this'll only take a moment .
there's a problem with walt waldowski .
painless?
you got a toothache?
he's good .
no , no , it's not my problem .
see , it's his problem .
um ...
what do you mean?
what is it?
well , what is it ...
that's , um ...
it's difficult to talk about , you see , because i learned about his problem in confession .
oh , and you can't ...
i can't divulge .
can you give me a hint?
just an idea?
well , no .
um ...
but i can tell you how serious it is .
um , he and the boys were playing poker ... ... and one of the boys turned to him and asked him for a ruling on one of the hands .
and walt said , uh , he said " what does it matter?
it's only a game .
painless said " what does it matter?
it's only a game "?
poker , only a game?
yeah .
yeah , that's what i thought .
i guess i better go see a man about a tooth .
thank you .
see , i didn't know what to ... do .
pup pup .
you see , there are some ...
there are some things that absolution just , uh ...
well ...
seven , eight , jack .
three on a low .
four , three ...
hawkeye , there's an empty chair here looking for a player .
baby , i've got a toothache like you can't believe .
why do you bring that dog in here?
last time you did i lost $30 .
why do you have to sit behind me?
it makes me nervous .
it brings me a lot of luck .
sit there , boone .
come on .
let's play , men .
deuce .
ace .
can i take some scotch?
sure .
you want some?
no .
how you feelin '?
no , don't touch me .
look , if a ...
if a man isn't a man any more , ... ... what's he got left that he should be living for?
ok , tell me about it .
what's the story?
well , you know that little nurse that was through here last night with the 325th?
the little one with the big ... boobs .
yeah , i know .
yeah .
well , anyway , i ...
i wasn't gonna fool around out here because i got these ...
i got these three girls that i'm engaged to back home .
and you wanted to be faithful .
baby , you are 7, 000 miles from home .
well , anyway , i took her out last night and i ...
i failed .
you mean she wouldn't put out?
she wanted to , but it was me .
i couldn't ...
oh , you couldn't ...
it wouldn't ...
yeah , nothing happened .
not at all .
that happens to everybody .
it's happened to me four or five times ...
yeah , well , it's never happened to me before .
come on .
you're the best equipped dentist in the army .
you're the dental don juan of detroit .
that's just a cover up .
what's a cover up?
don juanism .
i've been reading about it .
it's a cover up .
it's a cover up for what?
well ...
i'm a fairy .
a victim of latent homosexuality .
i've turned into a fairy .
have you ... have you done anything?
no , but it's only a matter of time .
i just can't face it .
look , hawkeye , suppose that you found out that you were one , huh?
one ...?
yeah .
you wouldn't like telling your wife .
no , i can see that that would be a problem .
i got the same problem , only multiplied .
well , you know , man o'war , ... ... after they retired him from racing , they put him out to stud .
and he had an average of about 120 , ... ... 130 foals every year .
and he lived to be 36 .
and then when he died they did an autopsy and found out that he was a raving queen .
no , that's a little known fact , but it's the truth .
painless has a couple of years left in him .
maybe more .
he hasn't started raving yet .
painless is a dentist , and a dentist shouldn't read .
that's his problem .
his problem is that he believes it .
he is convinced .
it's an obsession and it is a vital force .
here he comes !
the jawbreaker .
he's not gonna break anything .
just act natural .
all right , painless?
how's she goin '?
something in a marshmallow?
no , it's ok , fellas .
i know you've been talking about me , and ...
well , i came over to tell you that i've decided that i'm ... ... going to commit suicide .
oh .
well , if you're really gonna go ahead and do it , ... ... do you think you could leave me your record player?
oh , sure .
thank you .
gonna miss you , painless .
how do you plan to do it?
a. 45 between the eyes?
that's awful sloppy .
it's reliable though .
well , that's another thing i wanted to ask you .
i'm , uh , sort of new at this game and , uh ...
do you have any particular method you'd recommend?
i don't know .
i think my colleagues and i could come up with something ... ... to relinquish the vital forces of their ...
black capsule .
black capsule .
of course .
that's neat .
what's a black capsule?
you have any?
does it work?
it worked for hitler and eva braun .
it should work for you .
hawkeye , i really must ...
i should check with the military vicar's office .
i cannot give absolution to a man who is about to commit suicide .
it's a mortal sin .
look , dago , he is not committing suicide , only intending to .
so you're not dealing with an act , but with an intention .
if it works , he will not commit suicide , so therefore you're preventing a mortal sin .
ok?
well , i should check .
well , you check on it .
well , there's ...
all right , where you at?
there you go .
now , then , you've all come here to say your final farewell to ol 'walt here .
farewell , walt .
dear ol 'walt .
you know , i got an idea that maybe it's not such a final farewell after all .
i think maybe ol 'walt's goin 'on into the unknown to do a little recon work for us all .
huh?
i just wanna say one thing .
nobody ordered walt to go on this mission .
he volunteered for certain death .
that's true .
it's what we award our highest medals for .
that's beautiful .
that's what being a soldier is all about .
oh , yeah .
hear !
hear !
yes .
yes .
gentlemen , i think there's only one person who has anything to add to that .
and that's dago red .
oh , the padre .
let's hear it for the padre .
walt , here's ... here's your black capsule .
oh .
look , this thing works pretty fast , doesn't it?
i think i better go lie down over there .
uh , walt , that'll help you .
# through early morning fog i see
# visions of the things to be
# the pains that are withheld for me
# i realise
# and i can see
# that suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes
# and i can take or leave it if i please
# the game of life is hard to play
# i'm going to lose it anyway
# the losing card i'll someday lay
# so this is all i have to say
# that suicide is painless wherever you go , take this .
good luck . # it brings on many changes it's out there . # and i can take or leave it if i please i'll always remember you just like this .
# the only way to win is cheat
# and lay it down before i'm beat mm hm .
# and to another give my seat
# for that's the only painless feat
painless .
# suicide is painless
# it brings on many changes nice party .
thanks for asking me . # and i can take or leave it if i please thing is ... ... you're throwing your whole education away .
# and you can do good night , jawbreaker .
# the same thing
# if you please
hi , baby .
hi .
i'm glad you could come .
sorry it was so late .
that's ok .
i really couldn't sleep anyway .
i'm so nervous .
you leavin 'tomorrow?
yeah .
i'll be on my way in less than 12 hours .
i suppose who it's going to be really roughest on though is your husband .
why are you all of a sudden so concerned with him?
a man would be more considerate to his wife .
he wouldn't go home a nervous wreck .
stop using logic cos you're just proving ...
it could be an impersonal thing . ... why i shouldn't go to bed with you .
i didn't mean me .
you have the rare privilege that happens to chief executives of states or nations .
you have the privilege of restoring a human being's life ... ... by a tender act of mercy .
what is this?
oh , hawkeye , is he dead?
no , no .
he's not dead .
not yet .
painless has a psychological problem , and you're the only person who can help him .
oh , no , hawkeye .
oh , no .
come on .
no , maria .
you've gotta look on this as a nurse .
painless needs it for therapeutic value .
it will help him , and it wouldn't do you any harm either to think about it for a bit .
if you think that your virtue is more important than painless's life , that's fine .
i just want you to stay here and be with him for a minute .
just look at him .
just ... ... stay close to the whole man ...
oh , hawkeye !
... and look at him .
hawkeye !
oh , this is ridiculous .
you forgot your hat !
you wouldn't wanna leave without a souvenir .
have a good trip .
lieutenant schneider , you forgot your travelling orders .
wait .
you're supposed to pick ...
these are your travelling orders .
morning , painless .
oh , hi , hawkeye .
how's she goin '?
slept like a doll last night .
hm .
well , can't waste time .
big day .
got two jaws to rebuild .
come on , seidman .
have a good day .
attention .
attention .
religious services for yom kippur will be held ... will not be held this friday , ... ... due to mitigating circumstances .
for those who wish to observe said holiday , sunday has been reserved .
that is all .
trapper , this one's for you , babe .
that man is a prisoner of war , doctor .
so are you , but you don't know it .
it's in pretty deep .
i think that was my finger .
i need your help , hawkeye .
it's hit more than a lung .
what do you think?
i don't know .
hey , radar .
yes .
has that a negative come in from seoul?
we keep ordering it , but it never arrives .
how'd the kid take the induction , ugly?
good .
he's ready .
pickups and irrigation , please .
give me some gel foam .
not now , honey .
go back to sleep .
scissors .
sponge .
more sponges .
let's have the suction up here .
thank you .
rib spreader .
clamp .
let's give him a sexy scar , huh?
fantastic .
lot of blood .
sponge .
scissors .
watch it .
give me something to stuff it in with .
pickups for me .
how's he tolerating this?
good .
he's young .
things get slippery .
ouch !
you're a backhanded guy .
let me have the forceps and a sponge stick .
hot lips , you may be a pain in the ass , but you're a damn good nurse .
thanks , trapper .
put enough blood in him , john .
there's a clot on the cava above the atrium .
must be the point of entry .
clamp .
i feel a fragment right underneath the clot .
you control the cava .
ok .
we gotta stop that spurting .
clamp .
do what?
stop the spurting .
that's a very good technical term .
christ .
it's not in the cava .
it's in the pulmonary artery on the left side .
ok .
let me close him up and sit on it for ...
we can't sit on it .
what if we're jammed up?
we don't have the blood !
if you cut again , you'll lose him .
look , hawkeye , the artery can erode .
now's the time to take our shot .
a negative .
you said you didn't have any blood .
i found a donor .
up close , all crumpled up like that , they don't look like much , you know .
was he loaded or empty when he crashed?
he was loaded , but it didn't matter much .
you see , the two guys he was carrying were dead already .
what about the pilot?
pilot's fine .
took off a kneecap and he lost the function in his right hand , but he's great .
i didn't hear .
what colour was her hair?
black , shiny .
shiny , black hair .
black?
you like black?
i ...
i'm kind of partial to blonde myself .
i knew it .
i knew you had an attraction for hot lips houlihan .
hear !
hear !
go to hell , captain pierce .
you know i damn near puke every time i look at her .
'sides , i'll bet she's not a real blonde .
how dare you say that about an officer of the united states army , sir?
i'll not only say it , but i'll back it with 20 bucks .
how's that?
you have yourself a bet , sir .
you're my witness .
ok , but who's gonna be the poor schmuck who finds out?
well , i could , if no one else wants ...
i ...
no , no .
we , uh ...
we gotta all see it together somehow .
it's five minutes after the time the nurses shower .
where are they?
they will be here .
finest kind , ho jon .
what's happening?
radar ...
see the papers?
what?
you don't know about the papers the colonel left?
why didn't you tell me about the papers?
i tried to .
uh , uh .
here you go , here you go .
they're comin '.
evelyn , could you give me a hand?
sure .
hey , frankie , could you take a look at my corns , please?
knocko , the pictures of my kids have come .
hot lips , would you like to see them?
i'm not interested .
hey , scorch .
bravo !
bravo !

author !
bravo !
bravo !
author !
author !
20 bucks , huh?
you win the bet .
oh !
that's it !
major , what went on?
where's blake?
you can't see colonel blake .
you shut up , you twerp !
this isn't a hospital !
it's an insane asylum !
and it's your fault because you don't do anything to discourage them !
what do you want me to do?
put them under arrest !
see what a court martial thinks of their drunken hooliganism !
first they called me hot lips , and you let them get away with it !
and then you let them get away with everything !
and if you don't turn them over to the mp this minute , ... ... i ...
i'm gonna resign my commission !
goddammit , hot lips , resign your goddamn commission .
my commission !
my commission !
my commission !
a little more wine , my dear?
yes , please .
is that right?
come on , baby .
come on .
you all right?
keep it straight , eh?
first the present , then dinner , then a movie .
you mean all three of you?
where i go , warren goes .
you don't want me to go with you?
well , boone ...
he's syngman rhee's son , and he goes right in .
hey , soldier !

yeah , you .
where you from?
a mash outfit at the front line .
no , i mean your hometown .
it's on the east coast .
have you been wounded yet?
uh ...
yeah , a little ... a slight ...
would you like to say hello to your mother?
well , my mother's dead actually .
oh .
well , i'm sorry .
uh ...
i'd like to say hello to my father , if i could .
yeah , yeah , fine .
hi , dad .
excuse me .
i am making an examination of this young man ... ... to find out if he would be a soldier in our army .
yeah , i know .
hi , ho jon .
how's she goin ', boy?
his heartbeat is much too fast ... ... and his blood pressure is dangerously high .
oh , yeah?
oh .
i guess you think he's unfit for the army , eh?
yes , at first .
but when i saw on his paper he worked in an american hospital ... ... where there are many drugs and he could have taken some by mistake .
what would he do a thing like that for?
who knows?
to find the truth i will keep him here for a couple of days .
by tomorrow his fast heart and high blood pressure may be gone .
look ...
so i suggest you say goodbye to him now .
doctor , i've ...
it was a nice try .
come on , ho jon .
hey .
oh , man !
this is brought to you through radio tokyo ... ... by courtesy of the veterans of foreign wars , post number 63 of sedalia , missouri .
a federal court rules that el du pont de nemours and company , ... ...
remington arms company and the lmperial chemical industries limited of great britain ... ... have conspired to divide munition ...
hey !
hey !
idiot !

i wish they wouldn't land these things when we're playing golf .
that's him on the right .
wait !

gl's dad's a congressman .

apparently some big heart surgeon in boston told the congressman ... ... the only man to take care of his son is captain john mclntyre .
of course , i suppose there could be two captain john mclntyres .
no , no , i'm the only john mclntyre .
look , hammond says i can take someone to assist me .

what are you two hoodlums doing here?
ma'am , we are surgeons here to operate .
you can't go near a patient until colonel merrill says it's ok .
and he's still at lunch .
mother , i wanna go to work in one hour .
we are the pros from dover ... ... and we figure to crack this kid's chest and go play golf before it gets dark .
so find the gas passer , have him premedicate the patient , ... ... then bring me the latest pictures on him .
the ones we saw were old .
then tell the kitchen to rustle us up lunch .
ham would be fine .
steak would be better .
then get one nurse who knows how to work in close without getting her tits in my way .
oh !
oh , you fool .
how do you want your steak cooked?
towel .
say the magic words , you make a hundred dollars .
all right !
i demand an explanation .
somebody get that dirty old man out .
dirty old ma ...
i'm colonel merrill .
i don't care if you're jack armstrong , the all american boy .
if this chest gets infected , i will tell the congressman who did it .
scissors , please .
will you let me have a skin suture?
old pickups .
who was that?
that's colonel merrill .
this is his little store here .
oh , yeah?

i'm dr jekyil actually .
this is my friend mr hyde .
why don't you save your rapierlike wit for the clam diggers back home , hawkeye?
mm .
did i ever tell you about my friend , me lay marston?
oh , yeah .
your friend who would go around saying " me lay , you lay " to the girls .
he'd score once out of 50 times .
yeah , you told me about him .
he's passing gas for the congressman's son here .
oh , really?
when he's not passing gas , does he play golf?
i don't know .
d'you play golf?
no .
i have no time for golf .
i'm moonlighting down at dr yamachi's new era hospital and whorehouse .
this old guy i met when i came over .
he has a crude hospital for kids and finances it with a whorehouse all in the same building .
it's the nehwh .

she was the one in tangiers .
you can wait in the colonel's office .
he'll be back in a few minutes .
we don't blame you .

if that's ok with you , then we got a deal .
and if it isn't , we can always call washington ... ... and you tell them your story and we'll tell them ours .
it's as simple as that .
in the meantime we'll be at the pro shop where we are gonna shower and shave .
if you wanna get in touch with us , that is where we will be .

i didn't know you had a football team .
it's pretty much in the planning stage .

and what a team that was .
yeah .
i coached the boys myself .
he's the finest coach in the far east .
yeah .
we're trying to work out a schedule of the outfits we're gonna play this year .
of course , we , you know , throw a little money into a pot and make bets .
how much ... how much money do you put into your pot?
five thousand , six thousand .
five thousand dollars !
look , i don't think we're in the sort of league you're in .
well , i'm sure we can find a date when we can play your team .
it can be arranged .
yeah .
i think i'll talk this over with henry .
thanks , boys .
thanks for the drink .
thank you .
what the hell you ...?
sir , ever since the dark days before pearl harbor , i've been proud to wear this uniform .
what the hell is this?
a helicopter .
that man has five times the manpower to draw on than we do .
sure , so we get ourselves a ringer , right?
we get henry to apply , make a specific application for a neurosurgeon .
he asks for dr oliver harmon jones .
dr oliver harmon jones?
oh , he's , uh ...
who is oliver harmon jones?
he is better known as spearchucker jones .
he's a good ballplayer .
yes !
that negro boy , played with the 49ers .
sure .
sure , i remember .
he's good .
henry , if we had closer relations , we wouldn't have this misunderstanding , right?
now , that's where a football game would help between your outfit and mine .
a football game?
we put up a few bets , five thousand maybe , and have a little fun .
special services in tokyo says it's one of our best gimmicks ... ... to keep the american way of life going in asia .
betting?
no !
football .
but what about major o'houlihan?
you mean hot lips?
screw her !
it's a helicopter , general .
i know it's a helicopter !
uh , i just wondered about the social problem , you know .
i mean , he's the only negro officer in the whole camp , you know .
we got a problem , we'll stick him in with us , baby boy .
you're serious , ain't you?
sure , i'm serious .
i ...
i ...
i ...
it's enough for me to have to put up with you two yankees , but i'm , you know , that's ...
because of his wife , or was it a religious problem?
it was a conditioning problem .
why you called spearchucker?
i used to throw the javelin .
oh .
right , we're not here to sell lemonade , we're here to practise .
but first let's welcome spearchucker .
is it all right to call you that?
call me whatever you want .
i want you to know we're all the same here on the playing field , officers and men alike .
now , we're going to begin with the three basic principles : organisation , discipline and teamwork .
now ...
pardon me .
mind if we limber up first?
that's a good idea .
you organise that .
# move that line , hey !
hold that line , hey !
all right , seidman , keep 'em pushin 'that whatever you call it .
that's good .
all right , hot lips , keep their arms and limbs moving .
radar , you're a coach .
you're not a corporal , you're a coach , ... ... so keep them going through there .
good , hot lips .
all right , seidman , give 'em five .
all right , men , take five .
spearchucker .
we look pretty lousy , don't we?
for college players that have been out of training for seven years , yeah , you do .
i got an idea how we can make some money .
we leave him out of the first half .
we bet half our money .
they roll up some points , ok?
second half we stick him in .
we get odds from them .
we bet the other half .
we clean up .
good thinking , captain .
sounds good to me .
oh , and i had another idea .
i think we should have some plays .
usually in football you have organised plays .
well , if you don't mind , i took the liberty .
oh , you have .
i drew up seven or eight plays .
oh , these are good .
i think that's all this bunch can handle .
oh , very good .
yes .
oh , very , very good .
uh , what are these little arrows?
right into his hands !
well , it's only six points .
six points !
it's only one point .
one point !
who's that number one?
we can't stop him .
they call him super bug .
he had one year with the rams .
we can't do anything with him in there .
you gotta come in .
we can't wait .
no , we stick to our strategy , but you gotta get him out of the ball game .
hey , davidson !
here !
let's ease up just a little bit .
we don't want the score too lopsided .
go !
go !
he caught it !
who's he giving it to?
isn't that corporal judson?
judson's a lineman !
judson can't run !
for crying out loud , judson , what're you doin '?
duke , you threw me that ball !
you had the field open !
why'd you fall?
i'm no goddamn runner , i'm a lineman .
we're gonna really clean up today .
ah , it's only two points .
two points .
what d'you think you are , a cannon?
what kind of a snap was that?
we got a lot of money on this game .
this is embarrassing !
let's go !
yeah !
what happens now?
we get a free kick .
a free kick !
girls !
# hit that ball !
kick that ball !
another six points .
another six points .
look .

what the hell's the matter with you?
smith !
those damn bastards pulled something .
coach , did i break my 400?
400 !

i'm in the broad jump , coach .
get him back on the bench .
broad jump !
still 16 to nothing .
16 to nothing .
well , that's not bad .
16 to nothing in the first half .
i have to give them the old knute rockne .
about time for the gun .
right .
yeah !
men , ever since the dark days before pearl harbor , i've been proud to wear this uniform .
got a towel?
henry , have you pressed the bets?
today we are wearing ...

# hit 'em with a mortar !
kick 'em off the hill !
# mash 'em !

what's the matter with him?
you oughta know .
you pulled something .
i guess you don't wanna double the bet .
the hell i don't .
we beat you without him , and we'll go on beating you .
are you prepared to back that up with odds?
damn right .
three to one .
double the bet .
player 24 , who is he?
stop him !
stop him !
stop him !
who is that guy?
he wasn't in the game in the first half .
stop him !
that's spearchucker jones .
who?
he played with san francisco before he got drafted .
he's gonna be tough to stop , too .
henry , you brought in a ringer , did you?
radar , what's the general trying to say?
didn't bring him in in the first half !
he's just been informed as to the identity of our spearchucker .
his ringer's spotted our ringer .
how do you like them apples , charlie?
you can't trust anybody .
now watch him make the extra point .
isn't that illegal?
what kind of team is it?
they're falling all around like dead flies !
look !
a red flag !
we've got a red flag !
hot lips !
it's a penalty , you idiot .
judson , get off of him .
you'll be thrown out of the game .
judson , kill him !
what's wrong with you?
we're here to play football , not fight !
bastard 88 called me a coon .
called you a what?
coon .
ok , that's an old pro trick to get you thrown out of the ball game .
why don't you do the same thing to him?
what , call him a coon?
no , the boys in camp used to talk about his sister .
her name was gladys .
use it !
yeah .
all right , all right .
