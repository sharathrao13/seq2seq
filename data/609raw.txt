morgana !
surrender the baby , or i'll
ursula would have simply loved to have come ... but something came up .
now now , what was it?
oh , yes .
you all shish kebabbed her !
one minute you're on top , the next you're sushi .
now , is that fair , gramps?
i ask you .
but then , whoever said we had to play fair?
oh , undertow !
make way , little mershrimp !
i'm comin 'through !
now hand over the trident , or your precious granddaughter ... will be shark chow !
you can have anything you want .
just don't harm little melody .
well , well .
i get the trident ... avenge poor , unfortunate ursula ... and gain all the powers of the ocean !
and it's not even 10 : 00 .
not a bad morning .
hit the deck !
melody !
what have you done to me?
look at me !
i'm an anchovy !
this isn't the end , triton !
it's just the beginning !
after her !
you'll never find me , but i'll find you ... and your precious granddaughter !
we shall not rest until that madwoman is vanquished !
find her !
find her !
i'm sorry .
there is no sign of her .
she's vanished .
we'll keep trying .
we'll
sweetie , no .
oh , we've got to keep melody away from her .
until morgana is found , melody can't go in the sea .
and neither will i.
but , ariel
i'm sorry , flounder .
but if morgana is anything like ursula , she'll never give up .
this is the only way .
melody can't know about merpeople or atlantica ... or even you , daddy .
very well , ariel .
you're right .
sebastian , you will watch over her .
me?
aww !
melody?
melody?
oh , carlotta , have you seen melody?
not since this morning , your majesty .
louis , melody's not in here , is she?
no , your highness , but her birthday cake is .
twelve petite candles .
whoo eee !
this is gonna be some kind of shindig .
yes , sir , a real swanky soiree , as they say .
there's just one thing missin ': the guest of honour !
sebastian , you watch over her , " he said .
i'm too old for this !
a crab my age should be retired , getting a tan ... playing sea golf ... sipping a tuna colada !
not baby sitting another teenager .
melody !
hey , scuttle .
hey , sebastian .
what's kickin '?
uh , what's kickin '?
hmm .
l let me see .
don't rush me .
ha !
you know perfectly well what's kicking !
now , come along .
you gonna be late for the
sorry , sebastian .
melody , child , how many times do i have to tell you?
it is expressly forbidden foryou to be swimming ...
beyond the safety of the sea wall . beyond the safety of the sea wall .
any such swimmin 'is a reckless disregard of da rules ... don't ya know?
stop dat .
oh , sebastian , i can't help it .
i just love the sea !
hey !
come back here !
you're just like
like your mother .
hi , melody .
trust me !
this time i'm sure i've got it right .
yeah , that's what you said last time , and i was sore for a week .
oh , stop your carping and stand still .
oh , this is gonna hurt .
yes !
yes !
yes !
uh oh .
oh , it's just no use .
the power of the trident is just too strong for me to overcome .
i bet ursula could've done it .
what was that you said?
nothin '.
i'm just sayin '
stop criticizing me !
that's all my mother ever did was criticize me !
it was always " ursula this " or " ursula that " ... or , " morgana , why can't you be more like your sister ...
ursula !
well , it isn't ursula's fault i got miniaturized .
it's yours !
is not !
your fault that we had to hide out here for 1 2 frostbitten years .
is not !
your fault that we can never show our faces in polite society again !
you're really pushing it , small fry .
it's the locket !
it's the locket !
this is just the kind of break in the ice we've been waiting for .
when ariel's innocent little daughter ... uncovers the secret of that locket ... she's going to have lots of questions .
and who'll be right there with all the answers?
we will .
exactly !
she'll be the perfect tool for triton's undoing .
and i'll get to be big again .
finally i'll succeed at the one thing my sister never could .
really , really big again !
total domination of the seas !
i'll be huge !
melody , please .
if your mother ever found out you'd been swimming out here
i know , i know .
she'd flip .
i had a thought here .
now , where'd it go?
hey , sebastian ... what's my mom got against the ocean anyway?
i mean , how could there be anything wrong with something so ... wonderful?
you know what?
sometimes i even pretend i have fins .
i wish i could tell my mom how i feel .
but she'd never understand .
i can talk to crabs , but not to her .
wait a minute .
it just hit me .
how 'bout you tell ariel ... how you really feel?
oh , yes , by all means .
just waltz right in and tell her you been out here ... swimming in the ocean !
we could all just have a big party .
the party !
say , that reminds me of somethin '.
whoa !
oh , your your highness .
sorry .
my fault .
i gotta go .
can't go to the party without shoes .
if you ask me , she's a little strange .
i heard she actually talks to fish .
it should make for an interesting party .
i miss you , daddy .
i wish you could be here with us .
mother?
what are you doing?
uh , nothing .
i i'll be right up !
melody?
i'm ready .
here .
let me help .
so , we're having a bad hair day .
if we were , you wouldn't be helping , would you?
well , i'm just here to let you know there are a lot of people downstairs
oh , we'll be right down .
give us two minutes .
right , two now where have i heard that before?
mom , put down the brush .
it's hopeless .
oh .
you look beautiful .
do i have to do this?
everybody thinks i'm weird .
oh , honey , everyone has trouble fitting in at your age .
i know i did .
i was a regular fish out of water .
you?
no way .
i'm just so afraid i'm gonna make a total fool of myself .
melody , this isn't just about the party ... is it?
is there something you want to talk about?
you know you can always tell me anything .
well , okay .
i mean , it's kind of crazy and sort of impossible .
now , don't freak , but what i dream about ... more than anything in the whole world
how's it coming?
oh , melody .
is that you?
you look beautiful .
he's right .
now , we'll talk later .
you're going to have a wonderful time tonight .
trust me .
may i present her royal highness ...
princess melody .
oh , yeah .
mom's right .
i can do this .
um , hi .
would you like to dance?
go on .
sure .
okay .
oh , no !
that's it .
i'm booking me self on a cruise .
i'm so sorry .
well , i should say !

she's talking to a crab !
you !
saboteur !
you're going in ze bouillabaisse !
no , louis !
you don't wanna do this , man !
i'm old !
i'm not tender any more !
no !
melody !
death to the crab !
oh , louis !
oh , sweetheart , i'm so sorry .
what's wrong with me?
oh , nothing's wrong with you .
mom , i'm the princess of disaster .
being a teenager i is hard , and , uh ... all kids your age feel ... a awkward .
and , um  melody?
what is this?
my name's on here .
that song .
where have i heard it?
it's atlantica .
with merpeople and everything .
mother , you always said it was just an old fish tale .
where did you get this?
i i found it .
you went over the wall , didn't you?
actually , i went under it .
i hate that stupid wall .
melody , you know you're not allowed in the sea .
but why?
and why does that necklace have my name on it?
melody , listen to me .
you're hiding something from me .
y you deliberately disobeyed me !
i never want you going out there again !
do you hear me?
it's dangerous in the sea !
how would you know?
you've never even been in it !
m melody , i
oh , no .
ariel , darling ... we knew this day would come .
oh , eric .
you're right .
it's time i trusted her with the truth .
oh , now , child , it's gonna be okay .
you know , when i was a teenager ... you couldn't get me out of my shell for nothin '.
i had this high , squeaky voice ... and these itty bitty little pincers .
and then one day , boom !
i sound like caruso ... and these whoppers pop out !
young lady , just where do you think you're going?
i've gotta figure this out .
this necklace means something ... and if no one's gonna tell me ...
i'm gonna find out myself .
melody , please !
you're making a big mistake !
oh , this is delicious .
this is divine !
let's go , flatsos .
hurry , undertow .
there's a little girl out there who needs our help .
all right , sebastian , you must remain calm .
this is not your fault .
all you have to do is go in there and calmly explain ... that melody has run away .
no reason to lose your head .
whatever you do ... you absitively , positutely ... must not panic .
melody !
melody's gone !
melody's gone !
melody's gone !
sebastian?
well , what are you doing here?
all my fault !
i tried to stop her !
i don't deserve to live !
gone?
gone where?
out .
out to the sea .
what do you mean?
where could she be going?
to morgana's .
and she can tell me what this locket means , why it has my name on it?
oh , sure , kid .
morgana's the best .
she'll help ya .
okay .
then let's go .
angel face , meet the one and only ...
morgana .
oh , welcome , my precious .
oh , don't be shy .
come in .
come in out of the cold .
sit , sit .
put your feet up .
hungry?
afraid all i have is a cold plate .
smelt cicle?
kelp chip?
hush guppy?
uh , no , thank you .
i was hoping you could tell me about this pendant ... why it has my name on it .
my mother wouldn't tell me .
she just doesn't understand .
oh , you're not the only one with a mother who doesn't understand you .
believe me , i know just how you feel .
dear child , did you ever consider ... that it has your name on it ... because it has your destiny in it?
oh , deep down ... you know you weren't meant to be a lowly human .
what you are is something ... far more enchanting .
a mermaid?
but it's not possible .
darling , anything's possible .
you can turn me into a mermaid?
piece of fish cake , honey .
lots of luck .
ursula's magic?
where'd you get that?
i've been saving it for a special occasion .
one drop of this and , bada bing , bada boom !
you're in fin city !
whee !
really?
come , my darling .
your destiny awaits you .
i don't believe it !
i'm a mermaid .
say it loud , say it proud !
i'm a mermaid !
you had this all along .
you coulda changed me back .
why , i oughta
keep your scales on , small fry .
i'm still reeling her in .
oh , daddy , i'm so worried .
everything's going to be all right , ariel .
we have search parties scouring the ocean .
i'm going to join them now myself .
ariel , maybe you should go with him .
but , eric
i need to stay here and lead the search on land .
but you know these waters ... and you know our daughter .
you have to go .
it may be dangerous .
eric's right , daddy .
i should have known i couldn't keep melody from the sea .
it's a part of her .
and a part of me .
i have to go .
bring her home .
what a totally cool feeling !
oh , excuse me .
i'm so sorry , ma'am .
okay , get a grip get the hang of this flipper
it's like slipping two feet into one big , huge slipper
this way is left which way is right
oh , now i'll be circling in circles all night
oh , so this is forward no problem
i can't believe i can do this and more
to swim in the sea like i walk on the shore
out of my shell not closed up like a clam
look out , sea this is me
here lam
for a moment all of me
ls alive andat home in these a
i'm swirling and twirling so graceful and grand
not stubbing my toes getting stuckin the sand
fora moment life is cool
i'm a splash in the world's biggest pool
this is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be
for a moment just a moment
lucky me
lf only for one moment
i had shared with you all i know
these a wouldn't be a mystery
oh , why did you have to go
everything's newer and brighter and bluer
and truer to life than before
watch me soar
for a moment i can shine
got again and a fin that works fine
my fingers are wrinkly and really don't care
i fall of my curls have curled out of my hair
for a moment i can feel
all the dreams i've been dreaming are real
wish my mother could hear it
these a is my song
fora moment just a moment
i be long i will find you , my darling
and the moment that i do
i'll hold you close my melody
and sing the song of the sea
with you
sing the song of the sea for a moment , just a moment
with you i belong
oh , thank you !
thank you so much !
oh !
what's the matter?
oh , i knew this would happen .
one taste , and you're hooked .
oh , undertow , i'm such a failure , such a
oh , my precious ... there wasn't enough potion for this to be a forever spell .
please .
i i don't want to go back to being an ordinary girl .
isn't there some way i can stay a mermaid?
oh , i'm afraid there's absolutely no possible way .
well , there is one way .
no .
what am i thinking?
it's far too dangerous .
what?
wh what's too dangerous?
well , i could make the spell last longer ... if i had my magic trident .
oh , but it was stolen years ago ... by a deranged kleptomaniac ... and there's no one to get it back for me .
maybe i could get it back for you .
you would do that for me?
if i did , would you make me a mermaid forever?
even longer , if you like .
now , here is where the scoundrel lives .
atlantica?
you mean it's notjust an old fish tale?
it really exists?
ofcourse it exists , dear .
whoever told you otherwise?
my mother .
well , i'm sure she didn't mean to be cruel and deceitful .
okay , i'll bring back your trident .
you can count on me !
be careful , dear .
enjoy those fins !
while you can .
hmm , let's see .
south to two circles pass ... then , uh , north to

this is what happens when you bring a country fish to the big city .
was that a penguin?
wow !
nice crib .
come on .
follow me .
that must be him .
he looks sad .
he doesn't look like a thief .
they never do .
look !
there it is !

we're risking our tails for a fork?
we haven't time for this !
i want every available merman searching !
find her !

dash , if if this is the end ...
i just want you to know , pal ...
i'm sorry i said that thing about the blubber .
well , i'm sorry about the fish breath .
yeah .
you didn't say anything about that .
but i was thinkin 'it .
king triton , your daughter has returned .
ooh , that was close .
oh , sure , that's it .
take your time .

let's all just linger here and die !
i'm sure she'll turn up soon .
he's coming back !
my necklace !
ah , don't worry , ariel .
we'll find her .
daddy !
the trident !
but that's not possible .
nobody can remove the trident from the stand except you , sire .
you or one of your descendants .
melody .
who i was supposed to be watching .
go ahead , crack me open .
make a crab cake out of me , sire .
but how could she have gotten here?
morgana .
if she gets her hands on my trident
double the search parties !
i want every creature in the ocean on patrol !
yes , sire !
wait a minute .
i know those two .
it's all my fault .
if i had just paid a little more attention ... instead of blabbering on and on and on ...
and on and on .
from now on , your majesty , nothing gets past
me .
we did it !
all this time ...
atlantica was never that far away from home .
this is your home?
it used to be .
whoa !
what a pad !
talk about your kerb appeal .
but , uh , what's with the wall?
i know good fences make good neighbours , but isn't that a bit much?
yeah .
what you tryin 'to keep out?
it wasn't built to keep something out .
it was built to keep me in .
come on .
let's go .
you know , kid , the three of us , we make a pretty good team .
once you're a permanent mermaid , we'll be friends forever .
we'll be inseparable !
nothing will ever come between us .
shark !
run !

no , wait !
it's just
leavin 'so soon , boys?

come on !
you wanna be a mermaid , or what?
we got the power .
we got the power .
we got the power !
so there it is .
swim back as fast as you can and tell my father .
i'll try to find melody .
oh , but if that old sea witch is in there , and then there's that mean little shark ... and then those manta rays come , a and then she takes those those creepy tentacles ... so suction cups stick to your face , and , and
uh .
uh uh .
no way you're goin 'in there alone .
but , flounder , if we both go ... who's going to tell daddy where morgana's lair is?
say , what's all the whisperin 'about?
is melody around here?
did you find her yet?
if she's  scuttle !
get down and be quiet .
wait a minute .
scuttle can get help .
scuttle , i need you to pay very close attention .
we're doomed .
oh , there you are , darling !
oh , i was so worried about you .
and look !
you've brought back my trident .
clever girl .
give it to her !
give it to her !
give it to her !
hey !

he's got a little size issue .
now , if you'll just hand over the  melody , don't !
mom !
don't listen to her !
you're a mermaid?
you're a mermaid?
ariel , how nice of you to come .
and you brought flopper with you .
the name's flounder .
grrr " yourself , pipsqueak .
get that thing and hit me !
one bite , and he's shrimp toast !
sweetheart , hand me my trident now .
all this time , and you never told me?
kept the most important secret in her whole life from her own daughter .
please , give it to me , melody .
no .
hand it to me .
it's for your own good .
she's lying !
i've given you what you've always wanted .
she's the one who lied to you all these years .
i was trying to protect you .
by fencing me in?
you knew how much i loved the sea .
why did you keep the truth from me?
melody , listen to me .
if there was one thing in my life that i could do over , i
too late , mom .
melody , no !
all the power of the seven seas at my command !
hello !
can we get with the programme?
it's still a small world down here !
mom !
your mommy was only trying to protect you from moi !
what she did , she did out of ...
love .
little melody's been a very naughty girl ... stealing from her own grandfather .
my my grandfather?
king triton , ruler of atlantica ... commander in chief of all of the oceans !
or at least he was , until a certain little thief came along .
you tricked me .
you've got no one to blame but yourself .
tell me , melody .
is being a mermaid everything you dreamed?
was it worth it?
melody !
oh , and by the way ... your time as a mermaid has just about expired .
catch you later .
i've got bigger fish to fry !
bigger fish !
now , there's an idea !
we gotta keep trying .
it's no use .
it's too thick .
oh , flounder .
i've ruined everything .
we're guppies , man .
jellyfish .
the great tip and dash .
cowards slash losers .
well , at least we're alive .
yeah , if you wanna call this living .
okay , on the one hand we can live a long , healthy life ... albeit as disgusting , pathetic , cowardly
worms .
that's good .
good .
cowardly worms .
on the other hand , we could gather our courage , if we had any ... and storm the fortress and be heroes .
yeah , until they hack us up into fish bait .
you're right .
melody's in there .
she could be in big trouble .
she may really need our help !
so what's it gonna be?
a lifetime as worms ... or two minutes as heroes?
all hail queen morgana !
i'm hailin '!
i'm hailin '!
hold on , sweetie !
the cavalry is comin '!
ariel !
ah !
prince eric .
come to join the party?
we're having a blast !
oh , how dear ursula would have adored this .
morgana !
king triton?
oh , please !
is that the best you can do?
release my daughter , surrender my granddaughter ... and i shall spare you .
ooh !
what you gonna do?
throw the crab at me?
face it , triton .
you're all washed up !
uh oh !
i'm gonna be teachin 'you some manners !
now look at me .
i'm bait !
oh , yeah !

what have you done with her?
oh , you want to join your daughter?
well , i think that can be arranged .

another plan perfectly executed .
melody !
uh oh .
fools !
i have the trident now .
and all the creatures of the sea are in my power !
i'm the queen of the sea ...
and you will bow down before me !
oh , this can't be good for the lower back !
pathetic fools !
watch and see how utterly powerful i can be !
mom !
the end begins for all of you with fins !
that's it , triton .
bow down !
bow down before me !
no , your majesty !
you mustn't !
i'm sorry , sebastian .
i have no choice .
oh !
wishes do come true .
see that , ma?
who's your favourite now?
it's over , triton !
i sentence you to oblivion !
you !
just what do you think you're going to do ... with that?
stay back !
wrong end , sweetheart .
grandfather?
i think this belongs to you .
no !
never again will you or yours threaten my family !
there will be no escape for you ... ever !
mommy .
dad?
oh , melody , i was so afraid we'd lost you .
i'm sorry , mother .
oh , no , sweetie .
we're sorry .
we should have told you the truth .
i didn't mean to hurt anyone .
i just hoped i'd be a better mermaid than a girl .
oh , melody , sweetie , it doesn't matter if you have fins or feet .
we love you for who you are on the inside : our very brave little girl .
just like your mother .
oh , grandfather !
melody , i don't blame you for wanting to join us merfolk .
and because you're my granddaughter ...
i'm giving you a most precious gift : a choice .
you can come to atlantica with me ... or you can return to your home on land .
it's up to you .
i have a better idea .
now we can all be together !
i feel the musicplayin 'it's swingin 'andit's swayin '
life is a rhapsody , whoo
today we're so delighted today we're all united

strollin 'along down the what's that word again
