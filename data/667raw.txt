i've been hired to exterminate you .
you're gonna exterminate us?
listen , junior , you caught me and my friend here in a good mood today , so i'm gonna let you off with a warning .
step aside , and you won't have to feel the awesome wrath of our mustaches .
you mean these?
i thought you still had a piece of salad stuck to your lip from lunchtime .
they were fake?
of course they were fake !
this is what a real mustache looks like .
is he a mermaid?
all right .
enough gab .
what are you gonna do to us?
plankton was very specific .
plankton?
for some reason , he wanted me to step on you .
step on us?
yeah !
that way you'll never find out that he stole the crown !
perhaps i've said too much .
that's a big boot .
don't worry .
this will only hurt a lot .
i love this job !
bigger boot !
wait , pat .
this bigger boot saved our lives .
thank you , stranger .
stranger?
it's the cyclops !
help us !
help us !
save us , someone !
are we dead?
i don't think so .
artificially colored rocks?
i don't know where we are .
what is this?
it's some kind of wall of psychic energy .
no , pat , it's a giant glass bowl .
hey , there's some fish folk .
hey , over here !
hey !
hey !
hey , you guys !
you guys , hey !
help !
hey !

what's he gonna do with us?
oh , no , he's going for his evil instruments of torture .
glue?
google eyes?
he's making a humorous diorama of ... ... alexander clam bell?
patrick , he's killing sea animals and making them into smelly knickknacks .
and i think we're next .
you think so?
patrick !
no !
the heat is so intense from this lamp that i can't move .
tell me about it .
this doesn't look too good , patrick .
you mean we're not gonna
get the crown , save the town and mr. krabs?
i don't even think we're gonna be able to save ourselves , buddy .
thanks .
don't mention it .
well , it looks like what everybody said about us is true , patrick .
you mean that we're attractive?
no , that we're just kids .
a couple of kids in way over their heads .
we were doomed from the start .
i mean , look at us .
we didn't even come close to the crown .
we let everybody down .
we failed .
shell city .
yeah , we never made it to shell city .
shell city .
exactly , buddy .
yeah , the place we never got to .
shell city .
okay , now you're starting to bum me out , patrick .
no , look at the sign .
shell city .
marine gifts and sundries .
shell city is a gift shop?
but if this is shell city , then where's the ...?
crown .
crown .
neptune's crown .

okay , let's go over the instructions .
point bag away from home .

hooray for hasselhoff !
nothing can stop us now .
unidentified object off the hindquarters .
it looks like ... ... bigger boot .
but how?
dennis !
did you miss me?
this is the best seat in the house .
all right , neptune , let's get it on .
eugene krabs , your six day reprieve is up , and it is time for you to die .
please , i didn't do it .
there is nothing else i can do .
you can give spongebob and patrick a little more time .
except give spongebob and patrick a little more time ...
what?
mindy , will you butt out .
i won't have you stalling this execution .
stalling?
i'm not stalling anything .
yes , you are .
no , i'm not .
yes , you are .
you're doing it right now .
i'm stalling .
yes .
stalling?
stalling !
stalling .
stalling !
oh , boy .

i'm tired of running .
if we run now , we'll never stop ...

spongebob , be careful .
come on , kid , give it up .
dennis always gets his man .

yeah !
i did it !
you got guts , kid .
too bad i gotta rip them out of you .
i don't know what plankton's paying you , but if you let us go , i can make it worth your while .
it's gonna take a lot more than 5 ...
what is this?
that , sir , is five goober dollars .
legal tender at any participating goofy goober ...
i got bubbles .
fun at parties .
my eyes .
i got you , spongebob .
thanks , buddy .
thanks a lot .
that's it .
i'm through messing around .
see you later , fools .

so you think ... ... i'm ... ... stalling .
where am i , in crazytown?
i have had enough of this nonsense !
you are to wait in the carriage until the execution is done .
but , daddy ...
now !
no , no , no !
oh , spongebob , wherever you are , you better hurry .
okay , fellas , this is where you get off .
bikini bottom's directly below .
but we'll never be able to float down in time .
who said anything about floating?
initiating launch sequence .
what the ...?
did you see that?
the control .
all hands on deck .
ten seconds to liftoff .
nine , eight ...
eugene krabs , the time has come ...

oh , don't worry about me .
my parade shall be quite dry under my umbrella !
umbrella?
daddy , no .
daddy , yes .
all hail plankton .
all hail plankton .
all hail plankton .
all hail plankton .
all hail plankton .
spongebob , what happened?
plankton cheated .
cheated?
hold on there , baldy .
oh , grow up .
what , you think this is a game of kickball on the playground?
you never had a chance to defeat me , fool .
and you know why?
because you cheated?
no , not because i cheated .
because i'm an evil genius .
and you're just a kid .
a stupid kid .
i guess you're right , plankton .
i am just a kid .
of course i'm right .
okay , neptune , time to kill .
and you know , i've been through a lot in the past six days , five minutes , 27 and a half seconds .
and if i've learned anything during that time , it's that you are who you are .
that's right .
okay , neptune ...
a kid .
that's great .
now , get back against the wall .
but that's okay .
what?
what's going on?
because i did what everyone said a kid couldn't do .
i made it to shell city , and i beat the cyclops , and i rode the hasselhoff , and i brought the crown back .
all right , we get the point .
so , yeah , i'm a kid .
and i'm also a goofball .
and a wing nut .
and a knucklehead mcspazatron !
what's going on here?
but most of all , i'm ...
okay , settle down .
take it easy .
i'm ...
i'm ...
what the scallop? !
i'm a goofy goober
you're a goofy goober
we're all goofy goobers
goofy , goofy , goober , goober
put your toys away well , all i gotta say
when you tell me not to play i say no way
no way !
no , no freaking way
i'm a kid , you say when you say i'm a kid
i say , " say it again " and then i say thanks
thanks !
thank you very much
so if you're thinking that you'd like to be like me
go ahead and try the kid inside will set you free
i'm a goofy goober
what's happening?
his dance moves are impressive , but i'm in control .
seize him !
all hail plankton .
i'm free .
i've been freed !
what?
no !
my precious helmets !
his chops are too righteous .
the helmets can't handle this level of rock 'n 'roll .
karen , do something .
karen?
all right , that's the last straw .
neptune , i command you to ...
here you go , daddy .
i better get out of here .
look , it's the wizard who saved us .
out of my way , fools .
come on , i was just kidding .
come on , you guys knew that , didn't you?
with the helmets and the big monuments ...
wasn't that hilarious , everybody?
i will destroy all of you !
well , mindy , i have to admit , you were right .
your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait .
without it , i would have never again seen my beloved crown .
i think you're going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day .
now , let's go home .
daddy , haven't you forgotten something?
what?
oh , yeah .
eugene krabs , i forgot to unfreeze you .
what the ...?
i guess i had it set to " real boy " ending .
oh , i'm sorry for falsely freezing you , krabs .
and may i say , sir , you are a very lucky fellow to have in your employ such a brave , faithful and heroic young lad .
where is he , anyway?
i'm up here .
i'm on it .
go to him now , krabs .
embrace him .
spongebob , me boy , i'm sorry i ever doubted you .
that's a mistake i won't make again .
oh , mr. krabs , you old soft serve .
and now , spongebob , i'm gonna do something that i should've done six days ago .
mr. squidward , front and center , please .
i think we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager pin .
i couldn't agree more , sir .
hooray for spongebob !
wait a second , everybody .
there's something i need to say first .
i just don't know how to put it .
i think i know what it is .
after going on your life changing journey , you now realize you don't want what you thought you wanted .
what you really wanted was inside you all along .
are you crazy?
i was just gonna tell you that your fly is down .
manager !
this is the greatest day of my life !
you know , david hasselhoff is a great artist .
excuse me , sir .
you folks have to leave .
what?
say that again , if you dare .
you folks have to leave .
okay .
