i'll wait for your call regarding nicolas .
i neither won nor lost .

you are right , as always .
it's over , nothing left to say .
marion !
how about we give it another try?
open the garage door .
great .
mummy is back .
we are here .
good evening my loves .
i bought a cake .
you prepared everything?
looks good .
i must admit i'm rather fed up .
i had a very tiring day .
i'm exhausted
can you take the boy?
i'd like to take a shower .
i touch up my make up then you can have the bathroom .
you look fine .
i'll be quick .
you still want noodles?
not really right ...
dessert?
you don't want a dessert?
is it for them you're making yourself so pretty?
idiot , you re making me smudge .
take him .
shall we go read a story?
one afternoon , while she was making an airplane ...
she waters new flowers ...
aren't they pretty?
one afternoon , while she was making a paper airplane , the door opened .
who was it?
leon .
here i am , leon !
what are they doing?
they are hugging .
he didn't close the door .
he was so happy he forgot to close the door .
they're here .
good evening !
how are you?
good .
you?
you're alone?
he has not arrived yet?
no .
you were not coming together?
he got busy last minute .
i hope he won't bail out .
if he hasn't called , he's coming .
you know him , so unpredictable .
gilles is not here either?
showering .
things are better between you guys?
better .
i'll tell you later .
what would you like to drink?
gin please .
beautiful dress .
looks gorgeous on you .
where did you get it?
it was my mother's .
really?
hello how are you?
nicolas gone to bed yet?
yes .
did he cry?
just a bit .
two lesbian girlfriends of mine just had a baby .
i visited them at the hospital .
adorable .
how did they do it?
with a friend and a spoon , the most efficient .
spoon?
their gay friend jerked off into the spoon ...
the girl introduced the sperm in her vagina using the spoon !
very odd .
why not , if it works?
what do you tell the kid when he grows up?
the truth .
good luck to you .
marion , i find you awfully traditional .
the sperm spoon is the future .
it's more useful than a hetero husband .
nonsense .
i was hoping to ask your wife to be my surrogate mother , but i guess that won't work ...
is your boyfriend coming?
he should be .
i don't know what he's doing .
should i call him?
he'll be here shortly .
i don't believe in fidelity .
it's impossible , and it serves no purpose .
do you agree?
he's right .
being faithful is not natural .
respect for the spouse , trust ...
every couple has its lies and little secrets ...
it's perfect that way .
frankly , why resist temptation?
what for?
to have regrets?
no .
to feel stronger , for having resisted .
marion , you always amaze me .
gilles , what do you think?
nothing special .
liar .
what do you want me to say?
certainly not the truth .
then ...
i've never cheated on marion .
i've already cheated on christophe twice .
it didn't count , just flings with men coming through .
and you told him?
of course .
i tell him everything .
he's young .
i cannot stop him .
and so far he always comes back to me .
you're not jealous .
what for?
i'm an old thing .
i did the same when i was his age .
and i always like to have a third party .
it lets me have some respite , some rest .
what about you?
did you ever cheat on me?
what would you like me to answer?
no , of course .
incredible , i must forgive your errors ...
... but i must remain faithful .
that's my mediterranean , macho side .
i only cheated on marion once .
you think that's the right time?
well , we're all here pouring our hearts out ...
only fags can be unfaithful?
i'm sure you'd love to hear a good hetero cheating story .
why not if it's funny .
funny maybe not , but interesting .
maybe you'd rather not , marion .
i don't mind .
maybe we'll leave you guys alone now .
no .
i'm curious to hear the story he wants to tell you .
it was 1 . 5 year ago , at some friends 'place .
we hadn't seen them since our wedding .
they had organised a party at their place , 30 km away from paris .
nice ambiance , 20 guests , music , fun people .
everyone was drunk .
around midnight our friend lowered the lights .
we understood that , for those who wanted , the evening would turn into an orgy .
that's great .
rather surprising .
especially since we didn't know them that well .
we were a bit drunk
i was rather tickled by it .
women started to undress and lie down on mattresses .
the men folilowed .
it was well organised .
poppers , jelly , condoms , even coke .
first we watched from our little corner .
marion took my hand ... squeezed it real hard .
i asked her if she wanted to try .
you answered 'no '.
but go ahead if you want .
i told you i'd only go with you .
but you insisted i go alone .
you just wanted to watch .
that's all .
a girl came to fetch me and i went .
while marion was watching from the shadows ...
you had sex with this girl in front of marion?
not only with the girl .
even with men .
you did stuff with guys?
yeah , i took advantage .
i now know how my brother feels .
you're having us on !
what did you do to the guys?
run of the mill stuff .
sucked a few cocks , got fucked ...
you got fucked in the ass?
fucked in the ass?
marion , it's not true .
please tell me you didn't take part in ...
yes it's true .
shall we move to the living rooom?
i must get going .
oh no !
there's this party i promised to drop by .
christophe , are you leaving too?
matthieu , you want me to ...
up to you .
techno music , only young people .
don't know if you'll like it .
just what he likes we'll see each other later then
i'll call you when i'm done .
thanks for everything .
it was great .
my pleasure .
see you soon .
i'll call you .
bye marion .
i'll walk you out .
good bye .
nice boy this mathieu you like him?
yes .
nice , smart ...
and he knows what he wants .
yes .
i'm glad you like him .
i think he got along well with marion .
yes i think so .
we're good together .
don't you want to clean the plates under the tab before putting them in the machine?
where's the aluminum foil?
i don't know .
i'm happy for your brother .
why?
seeing him in love like that .
it's not that frequent .
i find it rather pathetic .
why do you say that?
the boy doesn't give a shit about him .
he went to his party alone .
he won't last long .
it's amazing .
when it comes to your brother ... ... you are always pessimistic .
and you optimistic .
it won't last a week .
how do you know?
just because it's not conventional doesn't mean they'll fail .
the most important is trust .
are you sure?
he told me they were not having sex .
gilles
what?
what are you doing?
nothing .
he was crying .
are you coming?
let me sleep .
it's a boy .
have you thought of a name?
yes .
we don't agree .
anything wrong otherwise?
no .
apart from the slight discharge this morning .
strange .
what?
has he been moving a lot lately?
no .
he's rather more quiet .
is anything wrong?
the placenta's position is off .
i'm afraid it might block the baby's exit .
is that serious?
no .
if it bleeds too much we'll just have to induce .
yes , darling .
what's the matter?
aren't you at the clinic?
really?
why?
yes i'm here .
i'm coming right away .
don't worry .
delphine , i'm bringing a dossier over .
no more calls .
now you turn up?
we've been waiting for you for 3 hours .
marion was beside herself .
is she ok?
it was not easy .
she's in her room , resting .
she's sedated .
and the baby?
in the incubator .
he's small .
they had a tought time getting him out .
the epidural didn't work ; she went through hell .
where were you?
we left messages !
i was caught in traffic .
marion didn't understand , she was worried .
since you were not here , i attented the operation .
it was not pretty .
she bled a lot .
fortunately they could perform a c section .
back in my days it would not have been so fast and efficient ...
as you know , i lost my first child .
yes , you told me .
are you sure it's this one?
yes , he's tiny .
number 5 .
you're sure it's not that one on the left?
i guarantee you it's number 5 .
why?
you don't like him?
he looks so fragile ...
the midwife explained it to me .
the membrane was not playing its role so he stopped growing .
that's why he's small .
they noticed it early .
otherwise he could have died in her belly .
i was told not to worry .
he should end up with normal weight and height .
they grow up naturally , problem free .
gilles , what's wrong?
you're not feeling well?
i'm fine ; i just need 5 minutes of fresh air .
do you want me to come along?
i'm fine thanks .
i'll wait for you in the waiting room .
yes .
when you're back we'll check on marion together .
see you shortly .
oh shit .
hello gilles
is he born yet?
yes .
marion is resting .
are you happy?
yes .
we were not expecting him so early , but ...
problems always come at the wrong time .
is monique around?
in the waiting room .
did she freak out?
pardon?
she must be so happy she must be hysterical .
maybe .
i don't know .
she's always hysterical anyway .
i'm going to see my daughter and the little monster .
coming along?
i finish my cigarette .
are your parents here?
i haven't called them yet .
see you in a while .
answering machine .
incredible !
i hope nothing happened to him .
you just gave birth , and you're worried about him !
you don't know what you're talking about .
he's not the one who just had a c section .
i'm not surprised .
when i lost the baby , your dad was not around either .
he had bigger fish to fry .
are you gonna shut your big mouth?
what's with you?
can't you leave your daughter in peace for 5 minutes?
you're ressassing the same old boring stuff .
is it my fault if gilles is not here , just like you 30 years ago? !?
when there's a problem you only know how to disappear .
cut it out !
your father started it .
shut up !
that's all we ask of you .
i leave you to rest .
bye dad .
thanks for coming .
you saw the way he spoke to me .
it's no big deal .
at least he came .
it doesn't mean he can yell at me like that .
go after him .
you think so?
you know he's waiting for you in the car .
yes
have a good rest .
hello?
it's me where are you?
i'll explain .
it's rather complex .
you ok?
no
why?
nothing .
it's me .
i'm in pain .
why aren't you here?
why did you leave?
i don't know .
i'm sorry .
did you decide on the name yet?
haven't thought about it .
what would you like?
i don't know .
what about you?
you wanted nicolas?
yes , i like nicolas .
nicolas it is .
marion?
yes?
i love you .
can you pop by the house and bring me some clothes?
marion?
has a marriage contract been drawn up?
yes .
in application of article 75 of the civil code ... ...
i will read through articles 212 to 215 ... ... on the rights and duties of the spouses .
212 . spouses must be faithful and supportive of each other .
213 .
they will jointly assume the moral and financial management of the family . they will provide for their children's education and future .
214 .
spouses contribute ... ... according to their respective capacity .
finally 215 .
the spouses must live in community with each other .
miss marion chabard ...
do you take mr gilles ferront for husband?
i do .
mr. gil ferront , do you take miss marion chabard for wife?
i do .
i hereby declare you legally married .
congratulations .
i want you .
are you happy?
yeah i'm happy .
i can't hear you .
yes .
i can't take off my dress .
i can't take it off .
never mind .
no !!
i'll go take it off .
keep the garterbelt on but take off your panties !
oh this is nice ...
i didn't take off my panties .
would you like a little strip tease?
i already don't excite you anymore?
gilles , are you asleep?
good night my love .
you scared me .
i love you , i love you , i love you .
it's cool .
come in .
jellyfish , jellyfish !
good evening .
i just arrived from the airport .
are you marion chabard?
yes
did you have a good trip?
so so
an animator will take you to your room straight away .
you room number is 230
you are not superstitious , are you?
no , no .
i feel good after our swim .
it's not that bad here after all .
now you see that you could trust me .
and it's not too crowded .
it's still strange though , all those people coming alone .
they're single and looking for a fling .
how dreadful .
i would never come here alone .
why not?
it's like a match making agency .
i find it very sad .
you can't help it .
what?
always criticizing .
i'm not criticizing , just stating facts .
is the weather nice?
yes .
i slept well .
did you hear a raucous this morning?
no .
what was it?
dunno .
in the corridor , doors slamming ...
i heard nothing .
do you want a piece of bread?
yes .
pardon me .
marion?
yes?
mr ferront , what are you doing here?
i should be asking you that ; i thought you were in senegal?
my friend dropped out , so i just booked any trip .
that's funny .
i'm here with my girlfriend .
you were not in the plane .
when did you get it?
i missed the plane .
came in last night .
are you here with someone?
no , alone .
then come have lunch with us later .
yes , why not?
so strange to bump into each other here .
i didn't expect to see you in a swimsuit one day .
see you later , in the restaurant .
see you .
who was that?
a girl who works for us ad department .
incredible to meet her here .
you didn't know she was coming?
we hardly know each other
are you jealous?
you are jealous .
told her to join us for lunch .
she's alone .
is she nice?
i don't know .
we'll see .
coming here alone doesn't bother you?
it does , but my girlfriend canceled at the last minute ..
we were supposed to go to senegal .
next time i guess ...
would have been very different holidays .
and it was not a package tour at all .
it was more of an adventure .
exactly what i would have liked to do .
why didn't you?
don't ask me ...
i could only take 1 week .
impossible .
gilles works too hard ...
i wanted to take 2 weeks to visit sicily before coming here ... ...
next time for me too .
sicily is very beautiful .
you've been there?
my boyfriend was from sicily .
went there a few times to visit his family .
you don't feel like going back?
not for the time being .
we broke up 4 months ago , i don't feel strong enough yet .
i'm sorry .
it's ok . you didn't know .
anyway it's over .
concentrate , we can't get a decent rally going .
no need to get upset .
do you have water?
thanks .
ah shit .
there .
you pick them up .
bravo ! it was really funny .
you move well .
i'm used to it .
that's how we communicate in the office .
i didn't understand anything .
i don't speak italian .
you didn't miss much .
do you want to go for a drink next door?
not me .
we're getting up early for the mountain trek but gilles ...
not if you're not coming , no .
good luck for tomorrow .
good night .
why didn't you go?
you did not fancy a drink?
no , it's ok .
may i sit here?
sorry , this seat is taken .
i thought you did not want a drink?
do you want one?
i find this girl touching .
who?
marion
you're trying to sell her to me or what?
i think she's pretty and very nice .
that's all .
would that turn you on if i fucked her?
it would turn you on , not me .
you're right , i feel like fucking tonight .
you look comfy here .
ah ! it's you?
hello .
hello .
can i sit down?
sure .
weren't you supposed to go trekking?
valerie went alone .
i didn't feel like it .
i felt like sleeping late and getting a tan .
it's really nice here .
yes .
it's real quiet .
not like the club
how was the disco?
nice .
i went back early .
alone?
why are you asking me this?
i don't know ...
but going to a disco alone ... ... makes it easier to meet people?
you really don't know me .
i only went there to dance .
have you gone for a swim yet?
no .
i was told the sea here is dangerous ...
... fairly strong currents .
is that so?
the sea looks so calm , though .
yes .
have you been with someone since your previous boyfriend?
no .
i don't feel like it .
not yet .
have you been with valerie for a long time?
4 years
are you married?
why do you ask me that?
i don't know ...
no .
we're thinking about it .
shall we go for a swim?
ok .
