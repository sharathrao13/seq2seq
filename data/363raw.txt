my client is a respectable member of the community , where miss sutton ...

i'd hate to see this guy's therapy bills .
speaking of bills , your client mr. lee , he made his first payment .
that's great .
you should be very happy .
yeah , it's fantastic .
he paid in fluke .
fluke is a fish , matt .
did you know that?

we need some better clients .
i'm tired of these pro bono cases .
what is your problem with our clients?
we have good , honorable clients .
decent people .
what's your idea of" better "?
define " better .
what would be a better client?
" better " means rich and guilty .
okay?
<i>remember when they taught us in law</ i> <i>school how to create a moral vacuum ... </ i> so you could represent people who aren't all necessarily innocent?

i hate to bring it up again , but i spent $3, 000 on that seeing eye dog .
i didn't ask you for the dog .
