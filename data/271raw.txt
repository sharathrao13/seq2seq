these are the true events of november , 1965
the la drang valley of vietnam a place our country does not remember ... in a war it does not understand .
this story's a testament to the young americans ... who died in the valley of death ... and a tribute to the young men of the peoples army of vietnam ... who died by our hand in that place .
to tell this story , i must start at the beginning .
but where does it begin?
maybe in june of 1954 , when french group mobile 100 ... moved into the same central highlands of vietnam ... where we would go 11 years later .
maybe the story begins in america ... when the army first realized a new kind of war was coming its way .
the white house anticipates a buildup and wants a victory ... over cavemen in black pajamas .
we wouldn't be there if they hadn't already beaten the french army .
the french army?
what's that?
the problem in vietnam is terrain jungles , mountains , rivers .
maneuver's a nightmare .
we have a plan to use helicopters leap in and out of battle .
they want you to run the test on the idea .
it'll take a hell of a combat leader .
i know a young light colonel named hal moore .
he led a combat company in korea .
after that , he volunteered to test experimental parachutes .
experimental parachutes?
sounds like just the guy .
the other side of the mountain was all that he could see
was all that he could see was all that he could see
the other side of the mountain was all that he could see
the bear went over the mountain the bear went over the mountain
the bear went over the mountain
how about we go back to " bingo "?
what do you say?
bingo " .
b i n g o
b i n g o
b i n g o
and bingo was his name o
tom , how much you know about our new colonel?
he was in korea ... has a master's in international relations from harvard .
harvard?
he's not one of those academic pussies , is he?
hal moore?
want me to get one of those?
come on , too tall .
gimme your best shot !
did you see that , sports fans?
did you see that?
snakeshit drives that one to the moon , baby !
hit the cutoff man !
hit the cutoff man !
and he's coming around !
here he comes !
no , he's not .
you're out !
you're out !
horseshit !
no wonder you can't fly .
you can't see .
i believe you're out .
you're a pilot?
too tall , sir .
yeah , i can see that .
you call , we haul .
can i speak to you , crandall?
yes , sir .
out .
safe .
out .
safe .
can i buy you a drink?
sure .
thanks .
so , your men call you " snakeshit " .
that's an affectionate appellation of my comrades in arms , sir ...
'cause i fly lower than snake shit .
well , i got a problem , snakeshit , and i think you're the solution .
i've been called a lot of things , colonel , never a solution .
you know what air cavalry really means?
you fly into hostile territory , outnumbered , 10, 000 miles from home .
sometimes the battleground's no bigger than a football field .
and if the choppers stop comin ', we all get slaughtered .
now , i figure chopper pilots won't fly into hell for strangers ... so ...
i'm hal moore .
i know , sir .
why us?
well , you guys look like shit , but your equipment is immaculate .
yesterday was sunday .
you didn't have to be training , but you were .
you got pilots like that too tall character .
he's way outside the limits of army regs .
they wanna fly with you for some reason .
i guess it's 'cause they think you're the best .
it's 'cause i only recruit the dumb ones , sir .
i don't suppose i have a choice in all this .
you sure don't .
wouldn't miss it for the world .
to the air cav .
good mornin ', sergeant major .
how do you know what kind of goddamn day it is?
group !
atten hut !
at ease , gentlemen .
welcome to the new cavalry .
we will ride into battle .
and this ... will be our horse .
you don't have to catch it .
you don't have to feed it .
but i can assure you ... that neither the new technology nor your status as officers ... will keep you above the danger .
sergeant major plumley and i come from the paratroopers ... where the officer is always the first one out of the plane .
because to follow your instincts ... and to inspire your men by your example ... you have to be with them where the metal meets the meat .
sergeant major plumley made all four combat jumps ... in the 82nd airborne during world war il .
sicily , salerno , normandy ... and holland , plus one more in korea .
he answers to me and to me alone .
now , i hope you gentlemen like training ...
'cause me and the sergeant major we love it .
three strikes and you're not out !
there is always one more thing you can do .
here we go , boys .
move !
move !
go !
now !
two .
let's go !
three .
we're outta here !
pretty good , huh?
pretty good .
there's only one thing wrong .
be sharp !
we will be the best platoon in this battalion !
be ready in there !
let's go !
let's go !
all right !
your officer's dead !
what do you do?
what do you do?
first
all right , he hesitated .
he's dead .
what do you do?
get off the chopper !
get off of the chopper .
hold off the third one .
come on in .
savage , you learn the job of the man above you ... and you teach your job to the man below you in rank .
that goes for every man in this outfit .
understood?
yes , sir !
we'll be landing under fire , gentlemen .
men will die .
have you said your prayers?
come on .
i'll say them with you .
fall in .
gimme that bear .
all right .
ready .
set .
in the name of the father , the son and the holy ghost .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with thee .
blessed art thou amongst women ... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus .
holy mary , mother of god , pray for us sinners
cecile , i don't hear you praying , honey .
i don't wanna be catholic .
i wanna be a " nethodist " like mommy .
you do?
and why is that , honey?
so i can pray whatever i want .
that's a sin .
no , that's not a sin .
god just made you hardheaded .
it's not a sin .
i'll tell you what .
you wanna
you wanna pray and thank god for our family?
yes , sir .
that's good .
let's do it .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with thee .
blessed art thou among women ... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , jesus .
i can hear you laughing , you know , even in here .
i'm not laughing , i'm marveling .
marveling?
at what?
that you can find stubbornness in your children ... and think it comes from anybody but you .
yeah?
mm hmm .
i'll give you something to marvel at .
he's a wild man .
when i pray  mm hmm . whatever i want
i thank god for you .
beautiful morning , sergeant major .
what are you , a fuckin 'weatherman now?
look what i found for the new baseball player .
sent us another bunch of officers .
uh huh .
real green .
gotta train 'em up .
makes me think i'm starting a new unit .
they sent new rifles too .
the m 16 .
that's supposed to be a pretty good weapon .
lots of plastic .
feels like a bb gun to me .
believe i'll stick with my pistol .
you think we're gonna get close enough to the enemy to use that?
what do you think , sir?
a leader must remain cool and calm .
and second , he must learn to ignore explosions ... the heat and dust , the screams of the wounded .
this is normal on a battlefield .
normal !
fortran , you need to get a company over to reinforce the left flank .
where is that coming from?
that's our advisors in vietnam .
the new radio's picking up atmospheric bounce .
when crazy horse was a baby ...
he nursed from the breast of every woman in the tribe .
the sioux raised their children that way .
every warrior ... called every woman in the tribe " mother " .
every older warrior , they called him " grandfather " .
now , the point here is that they fought as a family .
take care of your men .
teach them to take care of each other .
'cause when this starts ... each other is all we're gonna have .
did you tune that in?
yes , sir .
well , that's fine .
you're my radio operator .
you'll be fine .
you'll work it out .
any of you sons of bitches calls me grandpa ...
i'll kill ya .
godboldt , take your boots off .
go on .
everybody , take your boots off .
everybody .
socks too .
i want you to draw fresh socks from supply .
keep your feet dusted with powder .
everybody check each other's feet like godboldt and me .
now , that young man's a leader .
yes , sir .
that other fella that big , strong one there he wants to win medals .
why were you in the back?
goddamn it , why were you in the back?
he's eager .
ladies , i'm really , really glad you're here today .
some of you are new to the army and all of us are new to this post .
i thought we'd pool our resources and cover questions we have .
so , why don't we start with item number one food .
where's the best place to shop?
well , i tried big star , and it's okay .
but i keep thinking my water's gonna break right in the checkout aisle .
that takes care of food shopping .
so , item number two laundry .
the base washing machines don't work .
they're full of sand from the swamp missions .
i'll take care of that .
i've already complained .
we'll just go to the general .
in the meantime , the laundromat in town's okay ... but they won't let you wash your colored things in their machines .
at a public laundromat?
didn't make sense to me either .
i'm telling you , they have a sign right in the window ... says " whites only " .
what?
they mean white people only .
that's awful .
your husband is wearing the uniform of a country that allows a place ... to say his laundry's not good enough , when he could die for
i'm sorry .
i just  that's all right , honey .
i know what my husband's fighting for , and that's why i can smile .
my husband will never ask for respect ... and he'll give respect to no man who hasn't earned it .
the rest of his family is the same way .
anybody who doesn't respect that can keep his washing machine ...
'cause my baby's clothes are gonna be clean anyway .
well , i guess that takes care of item number two .
are you all right?
i think i think my water just broke .
we're all calm .
we're all calm .
a car !
a car !
colonel .
at ease .
at ease .
i heard one of my new lieutenants just became a father .
i came to say congratulations .
thank you , sir .
so , i didn't wanna disturb you .
no , it's fine .
it's all right .
please .
well , how's your wife?
she's okay .
she's okay .
she's sleeping .
so is my daughter .
i just ... wanted to be here for a while before i held her .
well , tag her already?
what's that say?
camille .
sorry about this , sir .
don't take that off .
leave that where it is .
that's an order .
colonel , may i ask you a question?
sure .
what do you think about being a soldier and a father?
i hope that being good at the one ... makes me better at the other .
why?
what about you?
i don't know , sir .
between college and here ...
barbara and i spent a year in africa .
we helped build a school for orphans .
they were orphans because the warlord across the border ... didn't like their tribe .
i know god has a plan for me .
i just hope it's to help protect orphans ... not make any .
well , why don't we ask him?
come on .
let's go ask him .
our father in heaven , before we go into battle ... every soldier among us will approach you each in his own way .
our enemies too ... according to their own understanding ... will ask for protection and for victory .
and so , we bow before your infinite wisdom .
we offer our prayers as best we can .
i pray you watch over the young men , like jack geoghegan ... that i lead into battle .
you use me as your instrument in this awful hell of war ... to watch over them .
especially if they're men like this one beside me ... deserving of a future in your blessing and good will .
amen .
amen .
yes , and one more thing , dear lord ... about our enemies ignore their heathen prayers ... and help us blow those little bastards straight to hell .
amen again .
amen .
thank you .
there's one about the kid with the apple tree , or the flying horse ... or the fairy tales with the deer and stuff in 'em .
daddy , what is a war?
a war is a
well , it's
it's something that shouldn't happen , but it does .
it's when ... some people in another country or any country try to take the lives of other people .
and then soldiers like your daddy have to
it's my job to go over there and stop them .
are they gonna try to take your life away , daddy?
well , yes , they're gonna try .
but i'm not gonna let 'em .
okay?
can't sleep?
the men are so young and
now they sent me a new crop even greener .
when i look at them , i ... see our boys .
well , then you're just the man to lead them .
i guess .
we intend to convince the communists ... that we cannot be defeated by force of arms .
i have asked the commanding general , general westmoreland ... what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression .
he has told me ... and we will meet his needs .
i have today ordered to vietnam the airmobile division ... and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength ... from 75, 000 to ... 125, 000 men almost immediately .
additional forces will be needed later .
get out your best dresses , ladies .
they're gonna want to celebrate .
don't you ever be sad
lean on me when the times are bad
i didn't hear the president mention a state of emergency .
no , he didn't .
well , without that declaration our enlistments won't be extended .
i'm sorry , hal .
forgive me , sir , but let me get this straight .
we form a division using techniques never attempted in battle ... against an enemy with 20 years of combat experience on his ground ... 12, 000 miles away from our ground .
and right before the army sends us into the fight ... they take away a third of my most experienced men , including officers .
i don't like it any better than you do , hal .
you saw this coming , didn't you?
yes .
that's why you gave me that new crop of platoon leaders .
korea didn't teach 'em anything .
politicians?
politicians .
hold me , hold me
never let me go
until you've told me told me
what i want to know and then just hold me
hold me make me tell you
i'm in love with you
thrill me , thrill me
thank you , sir .
by the way , hal , since we're being deployed ... they're renumbering the units .
you're now the commanding officer ... of the 1st battalion of the 7th cavalry .
the 7th .
the same regiment as custer .
thank you , sir .
be sensible with your new love
don't be fooled thinking
this is the last you'll find
but they never stood in the dark
with you , love
when you take me in your arms
and drive me slowly out of my mind
kiss me , kiss me
and when you do i'll know
look around you .
in the 7th cavalry ... we got a captain from the ukraine .
another from puerto rico .
we've got japanese , chinese ...
blacks , hispanics , cherokee indians .
jews and gentiles .
all americans .
now , here in the states ... some men in this unit ... may experience discrimination because of race or creed .
but for you and me now ... all that is gone .
we're moving into the valley of the shadow of death ... where you will watch the back of the man next to you ... as he will watch yours .
and you won't care what color he is ... or by what name he calls god .
they say we're leaving home .
we're going to what home was always supposed to be .
so let us understand the situation .
we are going into battle ... against a tough and determined enemy .
i can't promise you ... that i will bring you all home alive .
but this i swear before you and before almighty god that when we go into battle ...
i will be the first to set foot on the field ... and i will be the last to step off .
and i will leave no one behind .
dead or alive ... we will all come home together .
so help me god .
i love you .
hal , last night the enemy hit our camp at plaei me .
how many casualties?
none .
the enemy forces withdrew toward this mountain ... near the cambodian border .
how many men do you have battle ready?
sergeant major?
three hundred ninety five , sir .
exactly .
what do you estimate the enemy strength?
we appraise their numbers as manageable , colonel .
you have no idea .
we have no idea .
simple orders , hal .
find the enemy and kill him .
they attack us , no casualties .
they run and hide in the mountains .
naturally we chase them , of course .
smell like an ambush to you?
they get close enough to kill us , we'll be close enough to kill them .
round trip by chopper , 30 minutes .
so the first 60 men on the ground will be there a half an hour alone .
son of a bitch .
i think maybe you ought to get yourself that m 16 .
time comes i need one , there'll be plenty of 'em lying on the ground .
well , let's go do what we came here to do .
yes , sir .

your mama asked me to give you $600 .
good luck to you .
hey , you got enough room for one more?
if you're crazy enough , get in .
yes , sir .
hey , what are those lights down there?
enemy soldiers .
they use candles on the trail .
they're moving into position to attack .
here we go !
unload that shit !
let's go , let's go , let's go , let's go !

you got the balls to face me , but not the balls to face the enemy?
get outta here .
whoa !
i ever see you again , i'll kill you .
that's right .
quite a day , huh?
tomorrow will be worse .

do you got a death wish , galloway?
no , sir .
well , then why are you here?
'cause i knew these dead boys would be here , sir .
why aren't you a soldier?
you got the guts for it .
my daddy was a soldier .
my granddaddy , two of my great granddaddies was soldiers .
hell , that's how i came to be .
each of them lost a leg in the civil war .
my great granddaddy galloway , he lost his left ... and my great granddaddy reid lost his right .
they met in a shoe store in galveston .
every year after that , same date , same store , they'd get together ... and pick out a new pair of shoes for the two of them .
you are shittin 'me .
no , sir .
i swear to god .
anyway , one had a daughter , one had a son ... my grandparents .
what do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was?
i don't know , colonel .
it was meant to be , i guess .
yeah .
meant to be .
sir , galloways have been in every war this country's ever fought .
but when it came to this one , i didn't think i could stop the war .
i just thought maybe i might try and understand one .
maybe help folks back home understand .
i just figure i could do that better ... shooting a camera than i could shooting a rifle .
well ...
i sure hope you make it through this one .
you too , colonel .

i want you to take their place .
i'll show you where .
follow me .
yes , sir !
let's go !
captain , have your men dig some firing steps .
throw some dirt on those bodies , keep the smell down .
roger , sergeant major .
kind of makes you wish you'd signed up for submarines , don't it?
brigade headquarters wants you out on the first chopper at dawn .
what idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle?
gen. westmoreland wants a briefing .
give me the horn .
i am in a fight ... and i object to this order to return to saigon .
now , i will not leave my men .
is that clear?
out .
there's two of my men unaccounted for out there ... and it's where the worst of the fighting was ... so they'll be out there someplace .
let's go out and get 'em .
i'm with you , sir .
all right .
let's go .
they ... brought another ...
oh , god , julie .
julie , it's yours .
no .
he died keeping my promise .
sir , they're ordering us all out .
all of us .
they're gonna march reinforcements in .
they don't understand a damn thing , do they?
can't get out .
he's waiting up there in a cave , and that's what he wants .
the minute he sees live soldiers hopping on a helicopter ... he'll be all over us and then he'll get what he wants .
he'll get his massacre .
requesting permission to rejoin the lines , sir .
all right , son .
garry owen , sir .
i wonder what was going through custer's mind when he realized ... he'd led his men into a slaughter .
sir , custer was a pussy .
you ain't .
goddamn .
hell .
right now they're planning their final attack ... the one that will finish us off .
they'll nibble at us all night , then ... come dawn they'll hit us with everything they got .
that's what i'd do if i was him .
sergeant major , hand out the last of the ammunition .
yes , sir .
fix bayonets .
you were wondering how custer felt , sir .
you ought to ask him .
sergeant savage !
checking the dead enemies for documents ... and i found this on the guy that tried to bayonet you .
translated some of it , mostly personal .
thought you might wanna have a look at it .
what was that?
it's american artillery .
friendly fire .
how many casualties?
what the hell happened here , joe?
hey , joe .
colonel moore !
colonel !
colonel moore !
what is the key to your victory?
sir , tell us how you feel .
do you feel the states will be forced ... to take the north vietnamese more seriously?
how do you feel about the loss of your men , sir?
have you notified the families , sir?
i'm glad you made it , son .
thank you , sir .
you too .
i'll never forgive myself .
for what , sir?
that my men ...
that my men died and i didn't .
sir , i don't ...
i don't know how to tell this story .
well , you got to , joe .
you tell the american people what these men did here .
you tell 'em how my troopers died .
yes , sir .
thank you .
all of our men , living and dead , are off the field , sir .
well done , sergeant major .
in saigon , hal moore's superiors congratulated him ... for killing over 1, 800 enemy soldiers .
then ordered him to lead the men of the 7th cavalry ... back into the valley of death .
he led them ... and fought beside them ... for 235 more days .
kids , go to bed .
isn't there someone at the door?
go to bed !
children , your daddy's home !
daddy !
some had families waiting .
for others , their only family would be the men they bled beside .
there were no bands , no flags ... no honor guards to welcome them home .
they went to war because their country ordered them to .
but in the end they fought not for their country or their flag .
they fought for each other ...
dear barbara ...
i have no words to express to you my sadness of the loss of jack .
the world is a lesser place without him .
but i know he is with god and the angels .
and even heaven is improved by his presence there .
i know you , too , are sure of this ... and yet this knowledge can't diminish his loss ... and your grief .
with abiding respect and affection , hal moore .
we who have seen war ... will never stop seeing it .
in the silence of the night , we will always hear the screams .
so this is our story ... for we were soldiers once ... and young .
