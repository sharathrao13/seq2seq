it's a known fact , sonny jim , that a secret society ... ... of the five wealthiest people , known as the pentavirate ... ... run everything in the world , including the newspapers ... ... and meet tri annually at a secret mansion in colorado known as ...
... " the meadows .
who's in the pentavirate?
the queen , the vatican , the gettys , the rothschilds ... ... and colonel sanders , before he went tits up .
i hated the colonel , with his wee beady eyes ... ... and that smug look on his face .
you're gonna buy my chicken .
oh !
dad , how can you hate the colonel?
he puts addictive chemicals in chicken ... ... making you crave it fortnightly , smart ass !
interesting .
cuckoo .
charlie , would you like a juice?
look at what i've bought myself , a juice tiger .
a juice tiger?

i'm on a weekly world news garth brooks juice diet .
scores !
margin , one nil !
magic goal !
let's have a look at the replay .
william , move your head .
look at the size of that boy's head .

that's a huge noggin .
it's a virtual planetoid .
has its own weather system !
head !
move !
your sherri's late .
mom ... ... sherri and i broke up .
not sherri?
i liked sherri .
i didn't like the other girls you brought home .
don't make it any harder for me .
why should i make it easier , son?
you were good together , you and sherri .
i thought you'd marry .
you know i'm terrified of marriage .
i know that , son .
i know that .
maybe it's better not to marry .

where did i put it?
stuart !

all right , hon !
head !
paper !

move that melon of yours if you can .
hauling that gargantuan cranium about .
no kidding .
his head's like sputnik .
spherical , but pointy in parts .
that was offside , wasn't it?
he'll be crying himself to sleep tonight on his huge pillow .
mom , why do you refer to weekly world news ... ... as " the paper "?
the paper contains facts .
this paper contains facts .
and this paper has the eighth highest circulation in the whole wide world .
plenty of facts . " pregnant man gives birth .
that's a fact .
here it is , look .
read this . " mrs. x. the honeymoon murderer .
she marries men under fake identities and then she murders them .
she's murdered three men already .
victim number one was a lounge singer .
victim number two , a russian martial arts expert .
and she's also killed a plumber named ralph elliot .
and her whereabouts are unknown .
give us a kiss , tony , and cheer me up .

i think so .
good night , mom .
good night , charlie .
good night , dad .
fine , go .
you've stayed your hour .
ooh , yes .
morning , charles .
morning , sir .
are you working on the forms for the vendor?
yes , captain .
tony?
tony?
i don't want to intrude , but you seem a little down .
well , captain , it's about my job .
i'm having doubts about being a cop .
it's not like how it is on tv .
i fill out forms and paperwork all day .
point well taken , but even though it's not exciting ... ... it's very important .
yeah , but of all my times as a cop , i've never ....
i never chased a guy across a crowded square .
i've never hung onto that part of the helicopter .
you know that part?
you know?
i know it .
i've never hung onto that or even commandeered a vehicle .
that sounds like a lot of fun .
that's the other thing .
you're too nice .
i'm too nice?
yes , you're too nice .
why not be like a starsky and hutch captain?
where you haul me in your office and bawl me out ... ... because you're tired of defending me from the commissioner .
the truth is , i report to a committee .
some are appointed , elected , or co opted biannually .
it's a quorum , so to speak .
a quorum?
i thought i was gonna be serpico ... ... but instead i'm like fish from barney miller .
hey , somebody needs a hug .
captain .
okay , coming up .
hi .
haggis , right?
yeah , i'm the guy who ordered the haggis .
can i ask you a question?
sure .
do you like haggis?
no , it's repellent .
i think scottish cuisine is based on a dare .
i'm next .
you're next .
yes , can i help you?
i'll tell you how you can help me .
all i want is one new york steak ... ... a quarter inch thick .
that's all .
no more , no less .
get it and let me out .
i'm really busy .
be right back .
it's busy , hey?
it's insane today .
my dad's a butcher , and i used to work at his shop .
i can help you .
i'd love some help .
great , what's your name?
charlie .
harriet .
hi , harriet .
could you get four porterhouses?
okay .
just kidding .
hi .
so do you live in new york?

just tell me if that's too tense .
you guide me .
you guide me .
mom , can you get the school nurse?
get the school nurse !
help me !
it was an accident in shop .
get me a tourniquet?
anything .
thanks for helping me out at the butcher shop .
you were really nice .
oh , i was nice? " nice . " evidently you think of me as a woman friend .
and what is wrong with being nice?
nothing .
charlie?
yes?
name a bad thing you've done .
i've done bad things .
tell me one bad thing you've done , and it better be evil .
how evil?
really evil .
so evil that you would say it was " e vil .
like it's " the fruits of the de vil . " " e vil .
for example , how many people have you brutally murdered?
brutal " is a very subjective word .
what's brutal to one person might be reasonable to somebody else .
excuse me .
do you know russian?
yeah .
oh , this hurts .
no , this is hard .
not only are you extremely good looking ... ... but you're also very smart and that's no fair .
that's hard .
bright women intimidate you?
no , no .
not at all .
but it's a shame i'm going to have to destroy you .
charlie , come here !
nadia ... ... l am coming .
expand , contract , expand .
what do you look for in a woman you date?
i know everyone always says sense of humour ... ... but i have to go with breast size .
oh , my god .
come !
let us dance like children of the night .
here we are .
wow !
what a great place .
some tea?
sure .
well , show yourself around .
you know what this place needs?
a large poster of atlantic city .
oh , look , you got one !
i used to live there .
cubby wubby womb room tea ...
... and morning thunder .
i'll go with cubby wubby .
all right , thanks .
what's this?
oh !
i had a friend who was a martial arts expert and ....
oh , you had a friend?
it's a martial arts thing .
i thought it would look good on the wall .
it does .
you know , scotland has its own martial arts .
it's called " fuck you !
it's mostly head butting and kicking people on the ground .
it's late .
not for me .
who for , then?
who for , then , what?
if not for you , i wonder who it is late for .
not me , no .
i like the nightlife .
i like to boogie .
i'll make the tea , then .
you know ...
... maybe it is late .
i'll be honest with you .
i had a great time tonight ... ... and i'd really love to kiss you .
but if i kiss you , we'll end up on the couch , and if we end up there ... ... chances are we'll kiss in the bedroom ... ... and that's the part i always rush into .
it's not a good idea to rush into spending the night together .
i want to .
i have no problem with that .
you're it .
come here !
oh , no !
oh , god !
yes .
yes .
ralph !
i will .

ralph .
she " is your friend .
ralph .
ralph .
she .
i'm sorry !
i thought you were somebody else !
hi .
hi .
i'm harriet's friend , charlie .

i'm harriet's sister , rose .
she gave me a note to give to you .
great . " dear charlie , i didn't want to wake you .
make yourself at home and thanks for the ... ... hot dog .
harriet .
that's a very nice note .
let me make you some breakfast .
i'd love to , but i'm running late .
how do silver dollar pancakes ... ... fresh orange juice , bacon and kona coffee sound?
it sounds great .
sorry .
i didn't have those other things .
that's fine .
that other stuff will kill you .
whereas froot loops are light and reasonably high in fibre .
i care for apple jacks a great deal .
got them .
good .
so , is this your place?
no , this is our place .
harriet's and mine .
she sort of comes and goes but always ends up here .
she didn't speak of me?
no , she didn't " speak of you .
she mentioned a martial arts guy , and there was discussion about ralph?
oh , really?
she spoke about them?
she talked about the martial arts guy and kind of shouted ralph .
well , you know harriet .
actually , i don't .
but you did have sex with her .
hello !
i'm gonna go now .
i won't tell harriet that anything happened .
well , rose .
nothing did happen .
don't worry , charlie .
just be careful .
just be careful .
i had the greatest night of my life last night .
sounds like you really like her .
i'm smitten .
i'm in deep smit .
she is wonderful .
but we shouldn't talk about it .
i'll start analysing it , and that's no good .
that is good .
you should just let it happen .
relax .
i am a park ranger , and i will lead you on the tour .
all the rangers at alcatraz were once guards , myself included .
my name is john johnson , but everyone calls me vickie .
please follow me .
i love vickie .
he's great .
he's the best .
this is the main cellblock area .
home to such famous criminals as ai capone ... ... mickey cohen , joseph " dutch " cretzer ... ... and robert stroud , the famous birdman of alcatraz .
this time will be different .
if something happens , i'll let it go .
it's not my business .
for example , " ralph .
she says " ralph " in her sleep .
so what?
ralph?
this cell's for solitary confinement ... ... that's come to be known as " times square .
make sure everyone gets a look .
so who's ralph?
i don't know .
more importantly , i don't want to know .
that's good .
did you and harriet , you know , last night?
okay , dirtbag .
all you have to know is that harriet's a sweet and loving person .
well , that's good .
that's nice .
and yes , we did .
all right !
close it up , close it up , close it up .
this is something the other tour guides won't tell you .
in this cellblock , machine gun kelly ... ... had what we call in the prison system , a " bitch .
one night , in a jealous rage , kelly took a makeshift knife , or " shiv " ... ... and cut out the bitch's eyes .
another thing about harriet i love  no , no .
and as if this wasn't enough retribution for kelly ... ... the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing ... ... into the bitch's ocular cavities .
this way to the cafeteria .
tony , i'm really happy .
please , don't let me screw this one up .
i'll try .
alrighty .
that ocular cavity thing was  when he mentioned pissing into ....
okay , i got another one .
what's worse?
the cable goes out and you're left with synchronized swimming ... ... or
okay .
you're stuck on the bay bridge in traffic ... ... and you've just had two strong cups of coffee and three bran muffins .
no , wait .
i have a good one .
hello !
hello !
what's worse?
you go to your favourite restaurant ... ... order your favourite meal , take a bite ... ... and under the steak is a scabby band aid .
or ....
or being electrocuted .
and?
that's it .
i was electrocuted once .
it was horrible .
oh , well , that's ....
that's a crying shame .
can we get our check , please?
thanks a lot .

it's strange , but i feel really safe with you .
like in old movies when people never left each other .
i mean , they stayed together forever .
it's a great house .
they moved in the day they were married .
i'm throwing them a 30th wedding anniversary party .
mom , dad , we're here .

i'm charlie's father .

i'm sorry .
you surprised me .
i'm sorry .
i like this one , charlie .
she's quite a filly .

i do .
why don't you put your trousers on?

come on , don't show her the pictures .
lighten up , charlie .
you've got a pickle up your ass again .
i'm going to the washroom , okay?
evidently , i have a pickle up my ass .

and charlie , light a match !
are you away to crap , again?

no , actually i moved around quite a bit .
i had a really great time with your family tonight .
oh , great .
you know that martial arts expert friend you had?
was that here in san francisco?
no , actually it was miami .
your family's really great , charlie .
when your mother took out  was that before atlantic city?
it's a period in my life that i really don't like talking about .
charlie .
i hated atlantic city , charlie .
it's a town full of gamblers and lounge singers .
ralph?
no .
no .
oh , ralph .
have you heard of this?
mrs. x.
she murders her husbands , then changes her identity and marries again .
i never heard of it .
so what?
i think i'm dating mrs. x.
charlie .
two words .
therapy .
she told me she dated a martial arts expert .
it says that one of the victims was a martial arts expert .
last night , she put a move on my dad and tried to break his neck .
about 1 000 people have tried to break his neck .
if they also say " ralph " in their sleep , it's a good start .
look here , " ralph elliot .
plumber from dallas .
missing since his honeymoon .
charlie , you're just getting scared .
yes .
harriet could be the one .
yes .
you suspect her , because you're scared you'll marry her .
and to you that's death .
come on , just read it , okay?
read it .
for me , just read it?
" larry leonard , the croner ...
crooner . " ... made a name for himself ... ... being able to sing , in six languages , 'only you . " '
does harriet know the words to " only you "?
we haven't reached that critical ... ... " do you know the words to 'only you " 'phase .
so i'm afraid i'm not much help .
charlie !
you gotta move past this !
i'm worried .
you're living according to the weekly world news .
it's the 8th highest circulating paper in the world , i'll have you know .
look , tony , mrs. x.

i would lie to you , but kathy always tells the truth .
