and through music my soul began ... ... to soar
and i heard ...
... as i'd never heard before what you heard was a dream ... ... and nothing more
yet in his eyes
all the sadness of the world
those pleading eyes ... ... that both threaten ... ... and adore
christine
christine
christine ...
no more talk of darkness
forget these wide eyed fears
i'm here nothing can harm you
my words will warm and calm you
let me be your freedom
let daylight dry your tears
i'm here with you , beside you ... ... to guard you and to guide you
say you love me
every waking moment
turn my head ... ... with talk of summertime
say you need me with you
now and always
promise me ... ... that all you say is true
that's all i ask of you let me be your shelter
let me be your light
you're safe no one will find you
your fears are far behind you
all i want is freedom
a world with no more night
and you always beside me
to hold me and to hide me
then say you'll share with me
one love , one lifetime
let me lead you
from your solitude
say you need me with you
here beside you
anywhere you go let me go too
christine
that's all i ask of you
say you'll share with me
one love , one lifetime
say the word and i will follow you
share each day with me
each night , each morning
say you love me you know i do
love me
that's all i ask of you
anywhere you go , let me go too
love me
that's all i ask of you
i must go
they'll wonder where i am
come with me , raoul
christine , i love you
order your fine horses
be with them at the door
and soon you'll be beside me
you'll guard me and you'll guide me
i gave you my music ... ... made your song take wing
and now how you've repaid me ... ... denied me and betrayed me
he was bound to love you ... ... when he heard you sing
christine
say you'll share with me
one love , one lifetime
say the word and i will follow you
share each day with me
each night , each morning
you will curse the day
you did not do
all that the phantom
asked of you
monsieur andre .
monsieur firmin .
dear andre , what a splendid party
the prologue to a bright new year
quite a night , i'm impressed well , one does one's best
here's to us the toast of all the city
what a pity that the phantom can't be here
masquerade !
paper faces on parade
masquerade
hide your face so the world will never find you
masquerade !
every face a different shade
masquerade
look around there's another mask behind you
flash of mauve , splash of puce fool and king , ghoul and goose
green and black , queen and priest trace of rouge , face of beast
faces !
take your turn take a ride
on the merry go round in an inhuman race
eye of gold , thigh of blue true is false , who is who?
curl of lip , swirl of gown ace of hearts , face of clown
faces !
drink it in , drink it up
till you've drowned in the light , in the sound
but who can name the face?
masquerade !
grinning yellows , spinning reds masquerade
take your fill let the spectacle astound you
masquerade !
burning glances , turning heads
masquerade
stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you
masquerade
seething shadows , breathing lies
masquerade
you can fool any friend who ever knew you
masquerade !
leering satyrs , peering eyes
masquerade
run and hide but a face will still pursue you
what a night what a crowd
makes you glad makes you proud
all the creme de la creme watching us watching them ...
three months of relief ... of delight
of elysian peace and we can breathe at last
no more notes no more ghost
here's to health here's a toast to a prosperous year
to our friends who are here and may our splendor never fade
what a blessed release
and what a masquerade
think of it
a secret engagement .
look , your future bride .
just think of it .
but why is it secret?
what have we to hide?
you promised me .
no , raoul .
please don't .
they'll see .
let them see .
it's an engagement , not a crime .
christine , what are you afraid of?
let's not argue let's not argue
please pretend i can only hope
you will understand in time i'll understand in time
masquerade !
paper faces on parade
masquerade
hide your face so the world will never find you
masquerade !
every face a different shade masquerade
look around there's another mask behind you
masquerade !
burning glances , turning heads masquerade

why so silent , good messieurs?
did you think that i had left you for good?
have you missed me , good messieurs?
i have written you an opera
here , i bring the finished score
don juan triumphant
fondest greetings to you all
a few instructions just before rehearsal starts
carlotta must be taught to act
not her normal trick of strutting round the stage
our don juan must lose some weight
it's not healthy ... ... in a man of piangi's age
and my managers must learn
that their place is in an office
not the arts
as for our star
miss christine daae
no doubt she'll do her best
it's true her voice is good
she knows , though should she wish to excel
she has much still to learn
if pride will let her return to me
her teacher
her teacher
your chains are still mine !
you belong to me !
madame giry ...
please , i know no more than anyone else .
that's not true !
monsieur , don't ask .
there have been too many accidents .
accidents?
please , madame giry ... ... for all our sakes .
very well .
it was years ago .
there was a traveling fair in the city .
gypsies .
i was very young .
studying to be a ballerina .
one of many .
living in the dormitories of the opera house .
see the wonder from the east !
come .
come .
come inside .
come and see the devil's child .
behold , mesdames and messieurs , the devil's child !
devil's child .
murder !
murder !
which way? !
that way !
that way !
he's getting away !
i hid him from the world and its cruelties .
he has known nothing else of life since then ... ... except this opera house .
it was his playground ... ... and now his artistic domain .
he's a genius .
he's an architect and designer .
he's a composer and a magician .
a genius , monsieur .
but clearly , madame giry ... ... genius has turned to madness .
monsieur .
where to?
the cemetery .
to my father's grave , please .
where have they gone?
the cemetery .
in sleep , he sang to me
in dreams , he came
that voice , which calls to me ... ... and speaks my name
little lotte thought of everything and nothing .
her father promised her that he would send her the angel of music .
her father promised her .
her father promised her .
you were once my one companion
you were all that mattered
you were once a friend and father
then my world was shattered ... ... wishing you were somehow here again ... wishing you were somehow near
sometimes it seemed if i just dreamed ... ... somehow you would be here ... ... wishing i could hear your voice again ... knowing that i never would
dreaming of you won't help me to do ... ... all that you dreamed i could
passing bells and sculpted angels
cold and monumental ... ... seem for you ... ... the wrong companions
you were warm and gentle
too many years fighting back tears
why can't the past just die?
wishing you were somehow here again
knowing we must say goodbye
try to forgive teach me to live
give me the strength to try
no more memories no more silent tears
no more gazing across
the wasted years
help me say
goodbye
help me say
goodbye
wandering child so lost , so helpless
yearning for my guidance
angel or father friend or phantom?
who is it there staring?
have you forgotten your angel?
angel , oh , speak what endless longings
echo in this whisper
too long you've wandered in winter ... ... far from my fathering gaze
wildly , my mind beats against you you resist
yet your soul obeys yet the soul obeys
angel of music , you denied me angel of music , i denied you
turning from true beauty turning from true beauty
angel of music , do not shun me angel of music , my protector
come to your strange angel come to me , strange angel
i am your angel of music
come to me , angel ...
... of music no , christine !
wait !
wait !
raoul !
whatever you believe , this man ... ... this thing is not your father !
no , raoul !
no .
not like this .
now let it be war upon you both .
we have all been blind
and yet the answer is staring us in the face
this could be the chance ... ... to ensnare our clever friend
we're listening go on
we shall play his game
perform his work but remember , we hold the ace
for if miss daae sings he is certain to attend
we are certain the doors are barred we are certain the police are there
we are certain they're armed
the curtain falls
his reign will end
raoul , i'm frightened .
don't make me do this .
raoul .
it scares me .
don't put me through this ordeal by fire .
he'll take me .
i know .
we'll be parted forever .
he won't let me go .
what i once used to dream ... ...
i now dread .
if he finds me , it won't ever end .
and he'll always be there
singing songs in my head
he'll always be there
singing songs in my head
you said yourself
he was nothing but a man
yet while he lives
he will haunt us
till we're dead
twisted every way
what answer can i give?
am i to risk my life ... ... to win the chance to live?
can i betray the man ... ... who once inspired my voice?
do i become his prey?
do i have any choice?
he kills without a thought
he murders all that's good
i know i can't refuse
and yet , i wish i could
oh , god , if i agree
what horrors wait for me ... ... in this , the phantom's opera?
christine , christine
don't think that i don't care
but every hope and every prayer ... ... rests on you now
seal my fate tonight
i hate to have to cut the fun short
but the joke's wearing thin
let the audience in
let my opera begin
here the sire may serve the dam
here the master takes his meat
here the sacrificial lamb ... ... utters one despairing bleat
poor young maiden
for the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets ... ... you will have to pay the bill ... ... tangled in the winding sheets
serve the meal and serve the maid
serve the meal and serve the maid
serve the master so that when tables , plans and maids are laid
don juan triumphs ... ... once again
passarino , faithful friend ... ... once again recite the plan
your young guest believes i'm you
i , the master you , the man
when you met you wore my cloak she could not have seen your face
she believes she dines with me in her master's borrowed place
furtively , we'll scoff and quaff stealing what , in truth , is mine
when it's late and modesty starts to mellow with the wine
you come home , i use your voice slam the door like crack of doom
i shall say , " come hide with me where , oh , where?
of course , my room !
poor thing hasn't got a chance here's my hat , my cloak and sword
conquest is assured if i do not forget myself and laugh
no thoughts within her head but thoughts of joy
no dreams within her heart ... ... but dreams of love
master?
passarino
go away , for the trap is set
and waits for its prey
you have come here ... ... in pursuit of your deepest urge
in pursuit of that wish which till now ... ... has been silent
silent
i have brought you ... ... that our passions may fuse and merge
in your mind you've already succumbed to me
dropped all defenses completely succumbed to me
now you are here with me
no second thoughts
you've decided
decided
past the point of no return
no backward glances
our games of make believe ... ... are at an end
past all thought of " if " or " when
no use resisting
abandon thought
and let the dream descend
what raging fire shall flood the soul?
what rich desire unlocks its door?
what sweet seduction lies before us?
past the point of no return
the final threshold
what warm , unspoken secrets
will we learn?
beyond the point of no ... ... return
you have brought me ... ... to that moment when words run dry ... to that moment when speech disappears ... ... into silence
silence
i have come here
hardly knowing the reason why
in my mind i've already imagined ... ... our bodies entwining defenseless and silent
now i am here with you
no second thoughts
i've decided
decided
past the point of no return
no going back now
our passion play has now at last begun
past all thought of right or wrong
one final question
how long should we two wait
before we're one?
when will the blood begin to race?
the sleeping bud burst into bloom?
when will the flames at last
consume us?
past the point of no return
the final threshold
the bridge is crossed
so stand and watch it burn
we've passed the point of no
return
say you'll share with me
one love
one lifetime
lead me , save me ... ... from my solitude
say you want me with you
here beside you
anywhere you go
let me go too
christine
that's all i ask of ...
go !
piangi , my love !
oh , my god !
we're ruined , andre .
ruined !
where did he take her?
come with me .
i will take you to him .
but remember , keep your hand at the level of your eyes !
i'll come with you !
no , meg , no .
you must stay here .
come with me .
do as i say .
no !
down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
down we plunge to the prison of my mind
down that path into darkness
deep as hell
why , you ask , was i bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face !
track down this murderer !
he must be found !
track down this murderer !
he must be found !
hounded out by everyone ... ... met with hatred everywhere
no kind words from anyone
no compassion anywhere
christine
why?
why?
your hand at the level of your eyes at the level of your eyes
at the level of your eyes
this is as far as i dare go .
thank you .
have you gorged yourself at last ... ... in your lust for blood?
am i now to be prey ... ... to your lust for flesh?
that fate which condemns me to wallow in blood ... ... has also denied me the joys of the flesh
this face , the infection ... ... which poisons our love
this face which earned ... ... a mother's fear and loathing
a mask
my first unfeeling scrap of clothing
pity comes too late
turn around and face your fate
an eternity of this ... ... before your eyes
this haunted face ... ... holds no horror for me now
it's in your soul ... ... that the true distortion lies
wait !
i think , my dear we have a guest
sir raoul !
this is indeed an unparalleled delight
i had rather hoped
that you would come
and now , my wish comes true
you have truly made my night let me go .
free her !
do what you like only free her !
have you no pity?
your lover makes a passionate plea
please , raoul , it's useless i love her
does that mean nothing?
i love her !
show some compassion the world showed no compassion to me !
christine , christine let me see her
be my guest , sir
monsieur , i bid you welcome
did you think that i would harm her?
why would i make her pay ... ... for the sins which are yours?
order your fine horses now !
raise up your hand to the level of your eyes !
nothing can save you now ... ... except perhaps christine
start a new life with me
buy his freedom with your love
refuse me , and you send your lover to his death !
this is the choice !
this is the point of no return !
the tears i might have shed ... ... for your dark fate ... ... grow cold and turn ... ... to tears of hate
christine , forgive me please , forgive me
i did it all for you and all for nothing farewell , my fallen idol and false friend
we had such hopes too late for turning back
now those hopes are shattered too late for prayers and pity
say you love him all hope of cries for help
and my life is over no point in fighting
for either way you choose you cannot win but either way you choose he has to win
so do you end your days with me?
or do you send him to his grave?
why make her lie to you to save me?
angel of music past the point of no return
christine , say no !
who deserves this?
don't throw your life away for my sake his life is now the prize ...
... which you must earn i fought so hard to free you
you've passed the point of no return angel of music
you deceived me
i gave you my mind blindly .
you try my patience .
make your choice .
pitiful creature of darkness
what kind of life have you known?
god give me courage to show you ... ... you are not alone
track down this murderer
take her !
forget me forget all of this
leave me alone
forget all you've seen
go now don't let them find you
take the boat swear to me never to tell ... ... the secrets you know of the angel in hell
the phantom of the opera is there deep down below
go now
go now and leave me !
masquerade
paper faces on parade
masquerade
hide your face so the world will never find you
christine , i love you
say you'll share with me
one love , one lifetime
say the word ... ... and i will follow you
share each day with me ... ... each night , each morning
you alone can make my song ... ... take flight
it's over now
the music ... ... of the night
