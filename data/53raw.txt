arrakis .
dune .
wasteland of the empire ... ... and the most valuable planet in the universe ... ... because it is here , and only here , where spice is found .
the spice .
without it , there is no commerce in the empire .
there is no civilization .
arrakis .
dune .
home of the spice .
greatest treasure in the universe .
and he who controls it , controls our destiny .
father !
this move to arrakis comes at a delicate moment for house atreides .
a test of your father's loyalty to the emperor .
you must remember , paul ... ... our society is a tangled web of competing forces .
our civilization rests upon a political tripod ... ... a most unstable of structures .
a deceptive balance of power exists between the emperor ... ... the congress of royal houses , and the supposedly impartial spacing guild ... ... with its invulnerable monopoly on interstellar transport .
complicated by a feudal trading culture that turns its ...
dr. yueh would be disappointed .
then he'd know how i feel .
it's never easy leaving one's home , paul .
think of this as a new adventure , the adventure of a lifetime .
you call this an adventure?
leaving our home for some dry speck of dust in the middle of nowhere?
you're a duke's son .
you have duties , responsibilities .
how could i ever forget?
every day i have to eat responsibility for breakfast and duty for dinner .
sarcasm doesn't become you .
i just want to see my father .
so do i.
the reverend mother has arrived .
she wants to see you before we depart for arrakis .
why are you afraid of her mother?
pitch of your voice gives you away .
she was my teacher at the bene gesserit school , now she's the emperors truth sayer .
you haven't answer my question .
i give you more bene gesserit training than a boy ever get .
she wants to see what kind of student you've been .
you have given him your face , jessica .
but the father has given him his eyes .
and his courage .
we shall see .
come here , boy .
let me have a better look at you .
if you know what's good for you , you'll do as i say .
i'll be the judge of what's good for me .
your mother has taught you many things , i see .
she tells me you dream .
your reverence ... ... if i could ...
you're dismissed , jessica .
since when is it permitted to treat the lady jessica as a common servant?
she was a common servant .
my servant .
and a good one , too ... ... until she was 16 , and your father took her .
now , i would like to hear about your dreams .
they're just dreams .
about what?
men dying
which men?
i don't know .
you lie . ... what else?
sometimes i see strange people worshiping water ... and saying a strange name ... my name i think .
and worse ...
it's horrible worse .
millions dying ...
jihad !
sometimes there's a girl , a beautiful girl ... ... but she frightens me , her eyes are strange .
and do you know this girl?
no .
what do you think they mean ... ... this dreams of yours?
why don't you tell me?
do you know what this is?
it is a test , young atreides .
a test for what?
put your hand inside and we'll see .
what's in it?
pain .
i hold the gom jabbar at your throat , young atreides .
keep your hand in the box and live .
remove it and die .
i must not fear .
fear is the mind killer .
that's right , boy .
pray .
i will face my fear , i will let it pass through me .
and when the fear is gone there will be nothing .
only i will remain .
no woman child , ever withstood that much pain .
you are a gifted boy , young atreides ... ... but you have much to learn .
he survived .
you should've warned me .
she was forbidden .
i'm sorry .
paul !
paul ...
you were supposed to have a daughter .
you have hopelessly complicated matters .
an atreides daughter could've been wed to the harkonnen heir .
the feud between the houses could have been ended .
my duke wanted a son .
you arrogant girl .
putting his desires above our interests .
how dare you turn your back on the centuries of our breeding programmes .
i'll pay for my mistakes .
and your son will pay it with you .
we'll do what we can .
he may be worth saving ... ... but for the father , nothing .
good thing you don't play your baliset as badly as you fight , gurney man .
too bad duncan isn't here .
then i could get a real workout .
now you've done it .
whoa , gurney man .
never submit to anger .
fast on defense , slow on the attack .
you forgot your first principle , gurney .
not likely .
look down , lad .
perhaps you'd like to sing soprano next time i play .
guess i'm just not in the mood today .
not in the mood?
mood is a thing for cattle and women , young pup .
mood is not for fighting .
even with the weirding ways your mother teaches you .
it's that old bene gesserit witch .
something she said ... ... or did .
the navigator is arriving .
we'll be on our way to arrakis soon .
it is said that they depend on the spice ... ... and that without it , they can't navigate .
it is said .
they used to be human , didn't they?
until the spice changed them .
i don't think anyone knows for sure .
i've never seen one .
no one has .
it's forbidden , paul .
so don't endanger our shipping privileges trying .
all non guild personnel , please secure quarters .
will arrakis be as bad as they say , thufir?
the storms , perhaps .
they can eat the flesh off your bones as you stand .
the only thing that doesn't fear an arrakis storm is the giant worm .
it's not worms i worry about .
your father is a formidable man , paul .
even the emperor fears him .
i'd sooner cast my fate with him than trust anything ... ... some bene gesserit hag said .
and so it begins .
the trap is set , the prey approaches .
a glorious winter is about to descend on house atreides and all its heirs .
the centuries of humiliation , visited upon my family ... ... will finally be avenged .
but arrakis was mine !
shut up , rabban .
i did what you said , uncle .
i made the people cover .
i crushed that vile planet .
he said squeeze , brother , not crush .
rabban aspires to rule house harkonnen one day , feyd .
and yet he can't even rule himself .
explain our plan , mentat .
the plan is elegant and vicious , dear baron .
of course it is .
i designed it .
in order for the empire to survive , the spice must flow .
but the production has become inconsistent .
in his wisdom , the emperor decided only one man is honest enough ... ... and loyal enough to be trusted with restoring the spice production adequately .
duke leto atreides .
temporarily interrupting 80 years of harkonnen rule ... ... and all the profits that go with it .
i said temporarily , you moron .
it doesn't take long for duke leto to believe he has arrakis ... ... firmly under control .
and then , at the moment of his greatest confidence ...
the traitor strikes .
a traitor?
who?
that remains my little secret for now .
what about the other great houses?
they're sure to protest .
perverting common wisdom , nephew , is a mark of all great conspiracies .
you see , nephews , a popular man arouses jealousy ... ... and duke leto is a very popular man .
the other great houses will be glad to get rid of him ... ... even though they would never admit it .
the spice ...
... will flow .
the emperor will be pleased and house harkonnen ... ... will be more powerful than ever .
alone and vulnerable , at the edge of the universe ... ... valiant duke leto will finally come face to face with fear .
when i'm through , he won't know who to trust ... ... not even that bene gesserit witch he sleeps with .
they'll all be turning on one another like rats in the flood .
by the time the traitor is fully revealed ... ... the fate of atreides will already be sealed .
my son always says you have a feline grace , duncan .
i didn't want to startle you , milord .
the latest emigration reports .
they fear our regime will be as bad as the harkonnens '.
we're losing too many .
spice hunters , drivers , weather scanners , dune men , we'll need .
should i , er , persuade some to stay?
no .
i have something more important for you to do .
i want you to go into the desert .
the fremen?
i'm getting reports of hundreds , perhaps thousands , in villages ... what they call " sietches " .
in the deep desert .
beyond the mountains .
the harkonnen sneered at the desert people .
hunted them for sport .
i doubt they'll expect any better from us .
then we have to change that .
we're going to need allies here , duncan .
i want you to seek out their leader ... ... this liet i keep hearing about .
a phantom .
he may not even exist .
he could even be many different men .
find out .
negotiate patience so i can demonstrate our good intentions with deeds .
if i'm lucky , they will judge all of us by you .
you honor me , sir .
i am endangering you and i know it ... ... but you're the only one i can trust with this .
such a dusty little garrison town .
a testament of the harsh climate of the place .
what's he doing?
water seller , milady .
you need never bother with the likes of them .
the cistern at the palace holds 50, 000 gallons ... ... and it's always kept full .
what's wrong with their eyes?
those are fremen , desert people .
it's the spice .
it's everywhere : the air , the food .
by the time a fremen child is 12 his eyes have turned completely blue .
guards everywhere .
we didn't have to live like this on caladan .
family apartments are in the west wing .
the furniture is being brought up .
what is this for?
an old custom , i'm told .
guests ceremoniously splash water on the floor after washing their hands .
they save the squeezings .
demeaning custom .
idaho has prepared for us well , milord .
duncan?
where is duncan?
can i see him?
i have him occupied on official business for the moment .
you have to be patient .
i've assembled the general staff , as you requested .
no , don't take it up there .
i want the coat of arms to hang here .
the first thing visitors must see , this is house atreides now .
we are not like the harkonnen .
you will be treated here with respect .
from now on , we speak the lady's language at all times .
the shadout mapes , milady , head of household staff .
mapes , show milady our apartments .
make sure she has everything she needs .
i'll join you after the briefing .
this way , milady .
come , paul .
the men are waiting .
me?
right now?
it's time you participate it .
i've had the girls sandscrub these walls to within a millimeter of their frames .
the harkonnen stench is finally gone .
built by off worlders many years ago .
a chapel for the memories of what they left behind when they came here .
a thousand people could survive a year on the water ... ... it takes to keep this place a month .
and a harkonnen never let us forget it , milady .
your name , shadout , it means well dipper , doesn't it?
i was raised in the desert sietches , noble born .
refer to me as milady , mapes .
i'm not noble born .
i am the bound concubine of the duke .
there is no wife?
i'm his only companion , the mother of his son .
you are bene gesserit?
yes , i know the ancient tongues .
i'm trained in the ancient ways .
this place is precious .
it should be protected .
tell the people , mapes , this place belongs to them now .
as long as we rule here ... ... the atreides family will keep it in trust for them .
stay there .
give them back their money .
go on .
it is a custom , milady .
this custom stops now .
do as i said .
do as i said .
water will never again be sold at the atreides 'door .
at the end of every meal , any person who calls at this door ... ... may receive a full cup , free .
is it possible?
could it be possible that she brings the mahdi?
the thing must take its course .
what about the mining accounts?
the harkonnen spice operation took ... ... 10 billion solaris out of here every year .
now , does anyone here still think that the harkonnen have just packed up and left?
gurney , i want you to make contact ... ... with the smugglers operating in the deep desert .
tell them that we'll ignore what they're doing from now on ... ... as long as they make it worth our while .
the emperor is extremely jealous of his spice profits , milord .
it's one thing to turn a blind eye to smugglers , it's quite another to pocket some of their earnings .
well , then just tell him what we're doing .
bank the entire amount to his name , shaddam iv .
but then deduct it from our taxes as a legitimate expense .
in other words , cost of doing business .
what?
i would just love to see the baron's face when he hears of this .
all the harkonnen parasites who got rich taking smuggler bribes ... ... will be flushed into the open .
no more graft .
the emperor cannot deny this .
not in public , anyhow .
well done , lad , well done
now ...
an emperor's daughter must do better .
worthy to be your first born?
they tell me her ambitions tend more to the literary than the political .
never underestimate the political uses of an awakened mind , majesty .
subterfuge and cunning are often better allies than a fierce heart ... ... and a strong back .
all she lacks is the primacy of our gender .
then you must marry her well .
someone with a suitably pliable personality .
too bad it won't be that young atreides .
the most admirable lad , i'm told .
good union of breeding and training .
we must arrange to send duke leto a token of our love .
he must continue to think of us fondly .
why did we come here , father?
and don't just tell me it's a matter of honor or duty .
there's more to it , isn't there?
i've never lied to you , son .
we've been entrusted with the most profitable commodity in the universe .
that alone makes us many enemies .
then why don't we call them out?
expose them ... ... in front of the emperor .
what if he's one of them?
this is a hard lesson , son .
in the world we live in , self interest governs all .
the emperor needs us ... ... for the moment , to administer arrakis , to make the spice flow .
but he fears us , paul .
he fears my influence among the great houses .
if he decides it's in his interests ... ... that house atreides should fall , he will do nothing to stop it .
he might even ... ... invite opportunity to hasten it .
well then , if you're right , this place is a trap .
perhaps .
but knowing there's a trap is the first step in evading it .
i should've taken the house atreides renegade ... ... fled to the darkest corners of the universe .
you're too honorable for that , my love .
no .
i'm too fed up .
this endless feud stops here .
the harkonnen are a rogue clan , leto .
no matter how much prestige they try to buy ... ... they'll never have the respect you've earned .
respect can't buy us peace .
i'd trade it all for a place somewhere , ... ... anywhere where we could be alone , where paul could be safe .
and all i had to think about was your happiness .
maybe then i could finally make ...
please , don't talk about things that can't be .
you belong to your time , i was bred to my destiny .
even if i were able to go back and choose ... ... i would change nothing .
one of yours , turok?
harkonnen mercenaries .
save your strength for the desert , atreides .
word has already been sent to the palace .
we have people among you .
are they trustworthy?
they are fremen .
i'll take care of these .
only half the sandcrawlers are operable ... ... but we'll have most of the ornithopters working soon .
that is a harvester factory .
we have about 1, 000 .
as big as she is , there are worms in the deep desert that could swallow one whole .
why don't we use shields?
shields are useless in the desert .
even a simple body shield will call every worm within 100 kilometers .
drives them into a killing frenzy .
the imperial ecologist , milord , dr. kynes .
we prefer the traditional term , planetologist .
i understand that we have you to thank for our stillsuits .
i hope they fit well .
this is basically a high efficiency filter and heat exchange system .
the skin layer is porous .
perspiration passes through heat filaments and salt precipitators .
water is reclaimed in catchpockets , which you can draw from this tube .
properly adjusted , water loss is kept under 15 milliliters a day .
that's hardly measurable .
that's the point .
you're a fremen .
i am accepted in both sietch and village .
but i am in the emperor's employ .
you've worn a stillsuit before?
this is the first time .
someone adjusted it for you?
no , it just seemed the right way to put it on , that's all .
well then ... ... the desert awaits .
maintain 120 degrees southeast , milord .
set .
that's where the sandmaster is concentrating his equipment .
how many men are there on a mining crew?
as few as possible .
mining is a perilous adventure at best , milord .
has anyone ever been lost out this far and survived?
men have walked out of the nearer zones by crossing the rock areas ... ... where worms seldom go .
fremen?
fremen .
there it is .
that's the harvester .
and those are the scouts?
yes .
watching for worm sign .
worm sign?
wherever there is spice , there are worms .
always?
they defend the spice sands .
has there been an effort to wipe them out?
too much area to cover .
too many worms .
a rich field by the look of the color .
is that worm sign?
where's the carryall to evacuate the harvester?
worm sign , approximately 40 kilometers .
he's got you .
estimated intercept , six minutes .
do they always cut it this close?
it's not standard procedure .
the carryall should be here by now .
how many men on that harvester?
usually 23 , milord .
are we sure the worm will attack?
no doubt about it .
crew on the harvester , this is duke leto atreides .
we're coming to take you out .
cease operations and prepare for evacuation .
spotters , land to the west .
prepare to be boarded .
those spotters only carry four men , in addition to the crew milord .
we can only get another two in here .
paul , you and gurney can get to work on the back seats .
we'll jettison them when we land .
i will get in three more .
this is harvester delta ajax niner .
with all due respect sir , we have almost a full load .
damn the spice .
we can always get more .
prepare for evac .
that's an order !
worm sighting !
worm sighting !
10 degrees southwest .
estimated speed , 40 knots .
we have an approach .
worm intercept , five minutes .
worm intercept , four minutes .
why aren't they coming out?
they are hoping that the carryall will show up at the last minute .
sandmaster , this is a direct command from your duke .
cease operations and evacuate the station immediately ... ... or i'll cut your ship in two with a lasgun .
i can hear it .
the worm .
i can hear it coming .
over here !
over here !
both of you , over here !
the rest to the spotters !
run , you sand dogs , run !
get down and hang onto anything you can .
what are they doing?
milord , we must go now !
hurry !
capacity overload .
we need altitude or it'll suck us down .
capacity overload .
capacity exceeds lift capability .
bless the maker and his water .
bless his coming and his going .
may his passage cleanse the world .
may he keep the world for his people .
how about the men we left behind?
send a ship to search for them .
but they were right by the worm ...
send a ship anyway .
when god ordains a man's time to die ... ... he directs that man to the proper place .
what?
paul .
i want the pilots from that missing carryall delivered to me personally .
someone's going to pay for that waste .
this is my legacy to you , son .
the greatest wealth in the universe and the never ending struggle to defend it .
the ancients used to say danger and opportunity were ... ... often the same thing father .
this is not one of yueh's academic exercises , paul .
on caladan we ruled by air and sea .
and here we need desert power .
desert power !
remember that .
mahdi , mahdi .
leto is growing more popular with every passing week .
he has ruined our system of bribes and patronage .
he's been able to maintain the spice quota despite our sabotage .
even that mongrel ecologist kynes is sending the emperor favorable reports .
and what do you deduce from all of this , nephew?
the longer we wait , the harder it will be to dislodge him .
piter , try again , will you?
leto's continued success makes the other great houses nervous , rabban .
we can hear whispers , petty jealousies that could easily give birth ... ... to considerable envy .
bugger envy !
we have a traitor among them .
i say strike now !
for your approval , uncle .
the slave is quite a specimen this time , don't you think , rabban?
perhaps feyd shouldn't be quite so casual today .
no .
perhaps my dear brother might even break a sweat today .
what you fail to understand ... ... is that i want leto to become popular .
i want him to feel secure .
i want him to feel confident .
confidence breeds distraction .
and that is when one is most vulnerable .
such a beautiful boy .
you asked me to inquire about the shouting the other day .
the words they were calling out at your shuttle .
mahdi " , something like that .
it means messiah .
they have a legend here , a prophecy ... ... that a leader will come to them from off world .
a boy .
the only son of a bene gesserit .
to guide them to true freedom .
messiah?
paul?
these are , uh , simple people , milord .
they survive on hope .
tell me about the waters of your homeland , muad'dib .
i'm sorry , milord .
mapes didn't tell me you were in here .
no wait .
it's fine .
i was tired .
i fell asleep .
you can go on about your work .
tell me ... ... do the cooks use much spice in our food?
the spice is everywhere on arrakis , milord .
everywhere .
don't move .
just do exactly as i say .
it's a hunter seeker .
they will kill you ... ... instantly , if you move .
listen to me .
the operator , wherever he is ... ... can only target movement .
stay perfectly still .
don't give in .
fear is the mind killer .
you're lucky to be alive .
i was its target?
it goes toward movement , that's all .
you could have let it go and saved yourself .
there is a traitor among you .
someone close .
someone very close .
i want him alive !
hey , you !
they tried to take the life of my son !
he looks local .
there's nothing to identify him .
harkonnen , surely .
and not working alone ...
stop it , both of you !
burn him .
everything except the hands .
put some spice in each one ... ... and send them to the baron on giedi prime .
he almost took the life of my son .
iniative?
you decided to show some initiative .
success is outside of the bedroom of failure , uncle .
hahhahaha , how poetic !
well then , perhaps you'd be so kind us to define the success .
the boy still lives ... but from now on with fear .
he and his father now know how close we can get to them .
yes !
now they certainly do .
your evening spice treatment , milord .
a ah , must finish it all .
health and long life are the gifts of the spice .
now get out !
get out , all of you !
out !
you simple ass .
i told you that i wanted those bastard atreides to feel secure .
but no , you couldn't wait .
you had to have your own way .
now your " initiative " has made them more defensive .
now what , piter?
advancing our timetable would seem appropriate at this point .
another blinding burst of insight !
how is it that i am blessed with such extraordinary counselors as these?
there is , of course , the slight troop transport problem .
our negotiations with the spacing guild are not yet concluded .
damn the guild and their navigators .
even the emperor can't move without the blessing of the spacing guild , dear baron .
and what would you suggest , my most devious mentat?
offer an increase in spice royalties ... ... payable in advance from rabban's own reserves ...
you are out of your mind , you ...
get on with it , piter .
we must try and turn this setback to our advantage .
perhaps your incompetence will prove useful after all ... ... and hasten the day house atreides must fall .
you're tired , father .
yes , i am tired .
the degeneration of the great houses has worn me out .
our house hasn't degenerated .
hasn't it?
your assassin didn't arrive here without help .
but who could you suspect?
i can only suspect .
i can't prove ... ... and there's suspicion enough to go around .
it can't be gurney .
he knew your assassin would be more valuable alive .
gurney's impulsive , father .
he doesn't have that kind of cunning .
or yueh's intelligence .
surely not yueh?
his suk conditioning would drive him mad first .
never let sentiment cloud your judgment , son .
there is someone .
sooner or later you must face whoever it is .
so this is how it works .
they sow the seeds of distrust ... ... and get us to fear each other .
learn this lesson well , son .
if you want to hold arrakis , you must be prepared to fight fear with fear .
fear and power .
that's our cue .
the man in silver is a stillsuit manufacturer in carthag .
an inferior product to the fremen's .
the hard faced woman next to him runs an escort service in arsunt .
impressive client list , i'm told .
by the fireplace , lingar bewt , water shipper from the polar region .
the man to his right ...
a spacing guild representative .
how could i miss him?
the man with thufir is esmar tuek , smuggler , highly successful .
he has fast ships if we need them .
milady , milord ... ... i was honored by the invitation .
you are always welcome here , dr. kynes .
we found the missing carryall , milord , hijacked by harkonnen agents ... ... who tried to sell it at a smuggler's camp .
they are now dead .
we are indebted to you , sir .
milady will see to it you have everything you need .
it will be my pleasure .
and my honor , milady .
i understand they lost another harvester to a worm .
if they keep this up , they won't even be able to have enough money to buy water .
gentlemen and ladies , her royal majesty , princess irulan corrino .
your highness , your attendance is a most welcome delight .
my father sends you his enduring respect and affection , my lord duke .
the emperor wishes everyone to know of the confidence he has in house atreides .
she brings the emperor's sardaukar killers as her bodyguards .
water customs here are so fascinating ... ... don't you think , your highness?
when i arrived , my bathing towels were hurried away almost before i was dry .
to save their squeezings , i assume .
that's a safe assumption .
nothing about this place is fascinating .
if it weren't for the spice , no one would bother about it at all .
fortunately enough , for a water seller like you , i would guess .
i enjoy watching the flight of birds here on arrakis .
many exist without any water at all .
carrion eaters , you know , blood drinkers .
a curious adaptation , don't you think?
you mean they are cannibals?
i said they drink blood , not necessarily the blood of their own kind .
it's said that fremen drink the blood of their dead .
isn't that so , dr. kynes?
not the blood , sir .
all of a man's water .
a necessity when one lives in the deep desert .
the human body is 70 percent water .
surely a dead man no longer requires it .
at least here is honest merrymaking .
careful , lad .
that spice beer can go to your head before you know it .
play , gurney .
let's you and i at least have some peace .
when the son of my beloved duke orders me to relax ... ... then , by god , i intend to do so .
is that how you really feel , gurney man ... ... about my father?
beloved?
you young pup .
if i didn't know better , i would take those words for an accusation .
it was a simple question .
your father rescued me from a harkonnen slave pit , boy .
he took me into his household , groomed me as his war master .
the man or woman ... ... that raises a hand against him ... ... will have it cut off by me , as a prelude to their death .
i'm ashamed of myself doubting you , gurney man .
that's enough , lad .
no more of this .
gentlemen and ladies , i use the terms loosely of course .
i , the baron harkonnen ... ... have decided that the great seal of our venerable house ... ... that confused and ugly chimera , the griffin ... ... no longer adequately represents the ambition of our appetites .
therefore and henceforth , in conclusion and furthermore , ergo and et cetera ... ... our ample and royal self ... ... from this day forth , and throughout the universe ... ... we shall no longer be known as house harkonnen .
we shall be ... ... house hog .
now i know why they say your skill with a knife ... ... is exceeded only by your mastery of the baliset , gurney halleck .
is it atreides custom to abandon an honored guest ... ... without even the courtesy of a lame excuse?
forgive me , your highness .
careful .
spice beer can go to your head before you know it .
so i've noticed .
you were expecting someone more delicate , perhaps?
refined was the word i had in mind , actually .
never judge a book by its cover .
we are not all that different , paul atreides , you and me .
you don't know what you're talking about .
i've heard all about the moody paul ... ... the grim paul , the angry and unhappy paul ... ... who has been exiled to arrakis , well , poor boy ... ... one day he will inherit responsibility for the greatest treasure in the universe .
and a never ending struggle to defend it .
we both suffer the solitude of our birthright .
except that tomorrow you will return to the comfort of your palaces on kaitain .
to the confinement of its perfect gardens and lonely apartments .
to your servants and entourage .
with their slavish flattery and cautious conversation .
as an heir to an emperor .
who damns my mother for bearing daughters instead of sons .
you're mocking me .
no .
i'm trying to interest you .
are you gonna dance with me or just stand there looking confused?
i didn't want to come here , you know .
being an ornament of my father's diplomacy ... ... is hardly my idea of a good time .
but you turned out to be more complicated than your reputation .
and i like complicated .
we've been looking for you , your highness .
so now you've found me .
have you been hurt?
be still , captain .
the princess has been under my protection .
oh , please .
gurney , hold .
stand down , captain .
gurney .
i said stand down , captain !
it's late , highness .
the shuttle awaits .
i am not ready to go .
your father left strict orders .
you see?
perhaps we should be the adults here .
set an example for our hot tempered friends .
you are more interesting than you appear , paul atreides .
i hope this won't be our last encounter .
my father will no doubt reward you for such mindless obedience , captain .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
father?
duncan?
forgive the abrupt arrival , milord .
but we've taken a force of harkonnen infiltrators .
the fremen found them in the cave of the shield mountains .
one of the fremen , turok , was badly wounded .
i rushed him here for treatment ...
but he has died .
this is stilgar , milord ... ... leader of turok's tribe .
we've heard many things in the desert about leto atreides .
i hope what you've heard will be the beginning ... ... of a friendship between us .
my people have suffered long under the rule of such as you .
no , not such as me , nor any of my family .
all that changed when the house atreides came to arrakis .
duncan?
paul .
stilgar , this is my son , paul atreides .
yes .
we have heard about him as well .
the fremen want me to remain with them , milord .
he fights well .
and he has done his best for our friend .
it will reassure us .
dual allegiance , milord , to you and to their tribe .
there is a precedent .
liet serves two masters .
let it be known among your people , stilgar , that duke leto atreides ... ... honors the sacrifice that your warrior has made on our behalf .
i wish nothing but peace between us .
we thank you for the gift of your body's water , stilgar ... ... and accept it in the spirit with which it was given .
duncan idaho ... ... your water now belongs to us .
the body of our friend , turok , remains with your duke .
his water now belongs to the atreides .
that is the bond between us .
mapes?
mapes !
mapes , who did this?
who?
traitor .
who?
guard dead .
shields .
the shields .
gurney !
yueh?
god forgive me .
i have no choice .
why?
why?
because i need to save my wife .
we haven't much time .
the harkonnen will be in the palace soon .
i'm giving you the final revenge , milord ... ... for this terrible thing i've done to you and your family .
you will have your revenge , milord , i promise .
just remember the tooth .
the tooth , milord .
when you have the baron face to face ... ... remember the tooth .
an emperor's sardaukar .
the duke !
where is the duke?
not in quarters , sir .
we can't find the young master either .
bastards !
he looks sufficiently paralyzed .
my half of the bargain , baron .
i promised you the duke , there he is .
well , it's a delicious sight , doctor .
now it's time for your half .
and believe it or not , i'm a man of my word .
where is she?
you promised we'd be reunited .
you said you'd free her if i did what you asked .
well , i've done it .
so where is she?
your wife is free , my good doctor .
completely free .
free of her mortal coil .
free of her physical cage .
i've freed her .
i promised you'd be reunited , and i'm a man of my word .
as now you can see .
you think you've defeated me .
never trust a traitor .
not even one you create .
my noble duke , are you enjoying the show?
i hope so .
i kept you alive so you could witness every precious moment of your betrayal .
what?
paul .
oh , the boy .
i don't know , i'd leave them to the desert , he and that gorgeous woman of yours .
my men left them to explore the beauty of the sands of arrakis .
perhaps they'll see some worms .
we couldn't have all that noble blood all over our hands , could we?
the emperor was quite insistent about that .
yes ... ... your beloved emperor .
just goes to show , never get more popular than the boss .
unless you intend to sack him .
did i say that?
how impolitic of me .
i must be spending too much time with that idiot nephew of mine , rabban .
you won't say anything will you , my dear man?
perhaps we should get on with it , then .
get on with it?
this is kanly , piter !
vendetta !
and i am going to savor every minute of it .
my family has hated the atreides for generations .
they have been the sand in our eyes , the stink at our meals ... ... these arrogant atreides , always standing in our way .
i want leto to appreciate the beauty ... ... of what i've done to him .
i want him to know that i , baron vladimir harkonnen ... ... am the instrument of his family's demise ... ... the extinction of house atreides ... ... and the ascendance of house harkonnen .
the tooth .
what did he say?
tooth .
what did he say , piter?
the tooth .
no !
need you more proof of what heaven's choice is?
atreides is dead , and harkonnen lives !
he's dead .
father's dead .
what are you doing?
we won't survive longer than a few hours in the open .
we have to find shelter .
but harkonnen patrols .
worms .
we have to take our chances .
one of ours?
we can't take the chance .
could be harkonnen coming to finish the job .
hurry !
harkonnen patrol ships are in the area , approaching fast .
strap in .
what is this place?
a fremen sietch .
a small one .
there's a storm coming .
we can stay here until it passes .
liet , we must talk .
rest here .
how did you know where to find us?
dr. yueh sent a courier .
said you were being taken to the bled , south of the mountain shield .
milord ... ... i'm supposed to give you this .
harkonnen patrols are in the area .
they tracked our thopter .
they called you liet .
you're the one , aren't you?
the one who's never seen , the one who may not even exist at all .
their leader .
i prefer the term guide to leader .
guiding them?
until mahdi comes .
harkonnen thopters approaching .
milord .
you're coming with us?
no .
they'll kill you .
me?
i'm dr. kynes .
i work for the emperor , you remember?
i'll just say i was your hostage .
milord , please .
i must remain with the fremen , milord , as i promised your father .
just hold on .
we can't lose them .
paul , the storm .
we can't go into that .
we have no choice .
nothing survives one of those storms .
unless they want to die , they won't follow us in , will they?
i must not fear .
fear is the mind killer .
i will face my fear , and i will let it pass through me .
when the fear is gone there will be nothing .
only i will remain .
there is a legend that the night house atreides lost arrakis ... ... a star exploded in the skies above their homeland on caladan .
but , the saga of dune was far from over .
