what i'm about to tell you is surprising .
these scripts contain everything that's been going on lately .
crab man .
kids stealing cars .
green baby .
wait a second .
i heard nothing about those .
but , prof. kyoto knew about it all this time .
it's all here .
prof. kyoto?
yes .
he must know about zebraman .
hey , did you ever hear anything strange from the professor's room?
no , i never did .
too bad .
i think kyoto knows what's going on .
i think kyoto is in alien hands .
who told you that?
wait a sec !
find him .
yes .
in yokohama , 34 years ago , a ufo crash landed .
the aliens mixed in with humans around the area of the junior high school .
soon after , the aliens began using the zebraman scripts for their plans .
the program was cancelled early .
the ufo aliens used the junior high school to further their plans .
they began to experiment further on humans .
prof. kyoto began a one man fight against the aliens .
that's why he wanted to transfer the students to another school .
he said ...
what?
anything goes .
he believed ...
dreams come true .
kyoto is an alien .
but not just a normal alien .
he's an original alien from the ufo .
hey .
yes?
we can't let you interfere with our plans for invasion ...
seigawa ...
seigawa san is dead .
i need a bike .
i should have a bike .
heroes always have bikes .
sorry .
kazuki ...
your father ...
needs to fly to the sky ...
sorry .
your mother ...
and sister ...
take care of them .
dad ...
do your best .
did you read the script for the final episode?
no .
how about asano kun?
he didn't read it either .
that's good .
i don't think i can fly .
when fighting the alien boss ,
zebraman
gets defeated .
but then ...
what happens?
zebraman ...
flies into the sky .
then he ... saves the earth and humanity ...
from the alien invasion .
that's the final episode .
what the heck is that?
who would watch such a show?
you've been practicing flying?
yes .
how long?
10 days .
i think to fly ...
is impossible .
i wish i never read that script !
my son believes in you .
he believes that zebraman will protect the earth .
for my son's sake ...
please ...
learn how to fly !
miss ...
yes .
did you ... understand my story?
yes .
there is one man who can help .
who is it?
it's zebraman .
it's zebraman !
you mean that striped guy?
sounds weird , doesn't it?
but i think he's the only one who can help us .
no need .
the order has been given .
tonight , the junior high school will be no more .
our operation will be over .
in a moment , the school will cease to exist .
i expect your support .
how can you say that?
everyone has gone crazy .
it's all we can do to survive .
dad ...
do your best .
he believes .
believes in dreams .
believe in dreams , believe in dreams .
why did you come here?
if something bad happened tell me ...
no , no .
i had something important to tell you .
you should not give up .
i really believe that you are a big hero , defending the earth .
you look terrible .
well , i'm sorry for saying such weird things .
later .
take care .
