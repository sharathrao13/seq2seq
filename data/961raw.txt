choose life .
choose a job .
choose a career , a family .
choose a fucking big tv .
choose washing machines , cars , compact disc players .
choose good health .
low cholesterol and dental insurance .
choose mortgage repayments .
choose a home .
choose your friends !
choose leisurewear and matching luggage .
choose a three piece suite on hire purchase !
wondering who the fuck you are on a sunday morning .
choose watching mind numbing , spirit crushing game shows .
stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth .
'choose rotting away at the end ,
'in a miserable home ,
'nothing more than an embarrassment
'to the brats you've spawned .
'choose your future .
'choose life . '
but why would i want to do a thing like that?
i chose not to choose life .
i chose something else .
and the reasons?
there are no reasons .
who needs reasons when you've got heroin?
goldfinger's better than dr no .
both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever .
a judgement reflected in its relatively poor showing at the box office .
in which field , of course ,
thunderball was a notable success .
'people think it's all about misery
'and desperation and death and all that shite ,
'which is not to be ignored . '
fuck off !
jealous cunt !
'but what they forget ...
'is the pleasure of it . '
all dead !
white meat !
you prick !
'otherwise , we wouldn't do it . '
you want me to do it?
yes .
pure as driven snow , that shit .
'after all , we're not fucking stupid .
'or at least , we're not that fucking stupid . '
'take the best orgasm you ever had .
'multiply it by a thousand
'and you're still nowhere near it . '
oh , it beats any meat injection !
that beats any fucking cock in the world !
'when you're on junk , you've only one worry scoring .
'when you're off it , you worry about all sorts of shite .
'no money , can't get pissed .
'can't get a bird .
got a bird , too much hassle .
'you worry about bills , food ,
'some football team that never wins .
'about human relationships
'and things that don't matter
'when you have a sincere , truthful junk habit . '
i'd say in those days he was a muscular actor .
with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster combined with a sly wit ... to make him a formidable lead .
and closer in that respect to cary grant .
'the principal drawback is you have to endure cunts saying ... '
no way would i poison my body with that shite .
all they fucking chemicals?
no fucking way !
it's a waste of your life .
poisoning your body with that shite .
every chance you've had , son , you've blown it .
stuffing your veins with that filth !
'from time to time , even i have uttered the magic words . '
never again , swanney .
i'm off the skag .
are you serious?
no more .
i'm finished .
it's up to you .
i want off it for good .
i've heard it before .
the sick boy method .
it really worked for him .
well , he lacks moral fibre .
he's a sean connery expert .
that's hardly a substitute .
you'll need one more hit .
i don't think so .
for the long night ahead .
'we called him mother superior
'on account of the length of his habit .
'of course i'd have another shot .
i had work to do . '
relinquishing junk , stage one preparation .
for this you will need : a room which you won't leave , soothing music .
tomato soup , ten tins of ; mushroom soup , eight tins of for consumption cold .
ice cream vanilla , one large tub of .
magnesia , milk of one bottle .
paracetamol , mouthwash , vitamins ,
mineral water ,
lucozade , pornography .
one mattress .
buckets for urine , faeces and vomitus .
one television and one bottle of valium procured from my mother who is , in her own domestic and socially acceptable way , also a drug addict .
now i'm ready .
i just need one final hit to soothe the pain till the valium takes effect .
mikey?
yeah , it's mark renton .
i wondered , could you help me out?
'this was typical of mikey forrester . '
what the fuck are these?
'normally , i have nothing to do with him
'but things were not normal . '
opium suppositories !
ideal for your purposes .
slow release .
bring you down gradually .
custom fucking designed for your needs .
i want a fucking hit !
it's all i've got , mate .
take it or leave it .
feelin 'better now?
i might as well have stuck them up my arse .
heroin makes you constipated .
the heroin from my last hit is fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt .
i'm no longer constipated .
i fantasize about a massive , pristine convenience .
brilliant gold taps , virginal white marble , a seat carved from ebony , a cistern full of chanel no . 5 , a flunky handing me pieces of silk toilet roll .
but under the circumstances ,
i'll settle for anywhere .
the worst toilets in scotland
yes , ya fucking dancer !
and now ...
now i'm ready .
the downside of coming off junk was mixing with my friends again in a state of full consciousness .
they were so like me , i could hardly bear to look at them .
sick boy came off junk too , just to show me how easily he could do it .
when all i wanted to do was feel sorry for myself , he insisted on telling me his theory of life .
certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life .
what d'you mean?
well , at one point you've got it , then you lose it .
then it's gone forever .
all walks of life .
georgie best , for example , had it lost it .
or david bowie or lou reed .
his solo stuff's not bad .
no .
but it's not great either .
and in your heart you know that although it sounds all right , it's actually just ... shite .
so who else?
charlie nicholas , david niven , malcolm mclaren ,
elvis presley ...
ok , ok .
what's the point you're making?
all i'm trying to do , mark , is to help you understand that the name of the rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory .
what about the untouchables?
i don't rate that at all .
despite the academy award?
that means fuck all .
it's a sympathy vote .
so we all get old , we cannae hack it any more and that's it?
yeah .
that's your theory?
yeah .
beautifully fucking illustrated .
give me the gun .
give me the gun .
have you got the beast in your sights?
clear enough , miss moneypenny .
this should present no significant problems .
for a vegetarian , rents , you're a fucking evil shot !
'without heroin ,
'i led a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen . '
good luck , spud .
cheers , cat boy .
if they think you're no tryin ', you're doomed .
they'll be on to the dss and your giro's fucking finished , right?
right .
but try too hard ...
you might get the job !
exactly .
nightmare !
it's a tightrope , spud .
a fucking tightrope !
i get pure shy with the interviewer cats .
i can't answer the questions .
i get nerves , like footballers on big occasions .
try some of this .
some speed just the ticket , man .
naw , i went to craigie craignewton .
i put royal edinburgh college to help get the job .
there's too much discrimination here .
they're both schools , right .
i put across the idea .
people get hung up on details .
like how many o grades i got .
maybe six .
maybe none .
it's not important .
what's important is that i am .
do you mean you lied on your application?
no ... well , yes .
to get my foot in the door .
showing initiative .
you were referred by the department of employment .
your foot was in the door .
yeah , cool .
whatever you say , man .
sorry .
you're the man .
the dude in the chair .
i am merely here .
obviously .
what exactly attracts you to the leisure industry?
in a word , pleasure .
like , my pleasure in other people's leisure .
do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
oh , yes !
i'm a bit of a perfectionist .
for me , it's the best or nothin 'at all .
things get dodgy i cannot be bothered .
but i'm getting good vibes about this interview .
seems to me it's going pretty well , eh?
thank you , mr murphy .
we'll let you know .
the pleasure was mine .
'spud had done well .
'he made me proud .
fucked up good and proper . '
picture the scene .
the other fucking week there , down the volley with tommy playing pool .
i'm playing like paul newman , giving the boy a tanning .
it comes to the last shot , the deciding ball of the tournament .
i'm on the black , he looks biscuit arsed .
when this hard cunt comes in .
obviously fucking fancied himself , like .
starts staring at me .
looking right fucking at me as if to say , " come ahead .
you ken me .
i'm not the type that goes looking for bother but i had a pool cue and he'd get it in his puss !
so i squares up , casual like .
what does the hard cunt do?
the so called hard cunt?
shites it !
puts down his drink and gets the fuck out of there .
and after that ... well , the game was mine .
'and that was it .
'that was begbie's story .
'or begbie's version of the story .
'later , i got the truth from tommy .
'you always got the truth from tommy .
'he never lied , never took drugs ,
'never cheated on anyone . '
it was wednesday morning .
we were in the volley , playing pool .
that's true .
but begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash .
his hangover's so bad , he can hardly hold the fucking cue !
i'm doing my best to lose , trying to humour him .
but every time i touch a ball , i pot something .
every time begbie goes near the table , he fucks it up .
fuck's sake ... !
so , he's got the hump .
but i set him up to pot the black , win one game , salvage his pride and not kick me in .
so , he's on the black ...
'pressure shot ...
'which goes wrong , big time . '
'he picks on this wee gadge ,
'accusing him of putting him off .
'he hadn't even glanced at us . '
fuck off !
'he'd have chibbed him . '
then i thought he was gonna do me .
the beggar's fucking psycho .
but he's a mate .
what can you do?
can i borrow this?
'what indeed could one do?
'try not to get involved . '
'begbie didn't do drugs .
he did people .
'he got off on it .
his own sensory addiction . '
nobody move !
the lassie got glassed .
no cunt moves till we know who did it .
who the fuck are you?
yes !
'as i sat watching
'the highly personal video
'stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends ,
'i realised that something was missing from my life . '
how's it going with gail?
no joy yet .
how long is it?
six weeks .
six weeks !
nightmare right .
she told me she didn't want our relationship to start out on a physical basis as that is how it principally is going to be defined from then on .
when did she come up with that?
she read it in cosmopolitan .
six weeks and no sex?
i've got balls like fucking watermelons i'm telling you .
i read it in cosmopolitan .
interesting theory .
actually , it's a nightmare .
i'm desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun .
try it wi 'tommy .
it's the only pleasure i get from him !
you know about my birthday?
no .
he forgot .
useless motherfucker !
useless motherfucker ; that's what she called me .
i said to her , look i'm sorry but these things happen , let's put it behind us .
that's fair enough .
yes , but then she finds out i've got a ticket for iggy pop the same night .
was she upset?
very , " it's me or iggy pop , time to decide .
so what are you going to do?
well i've paid for the ticket .
what are you two talking about?
football .
what are you talking about?
shopping .
'the situation was becoming serious .
'renton noticed the haste with which
'the successful in the sexual sphere ,
'as in all others , segregated themselves from the failures . '
'heroin had robbed renton of his sex drive
'but now it returned with a vengeance .
'the impotence of those days faded
'and desperation took a hold on his sex crazed mind .
'post junk libido , fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine
'taunted him with his own unsatisfied desire .
'dot , dot , dot . '
'and with that ,
'mark renton had fallen in love . '
excuse me .
i don't mean to harrass you but i was very impressed with the way you dealt with that situation .
i think you're special .
thanks .
your name?
diane .
where are you going?
home .
where's that?
it's where i live .
great .
what?
i'll come back with you but i'm not promising anything .
does this approach usually work?
or have you never tried it before?
you don't normally approach girls , right?
you're a quiet , sensitive type but if i'm prepared to take a chance ,
i'll get to know the inner you .
witty , adventurous , passionate , loving , loyal ...
taxi !
a little bit crazy , a little bit bad .
but hey , don't us girls just love that
well?
what's wrong , boy?
cat got your tongue?
i left something ...
are you getting in?
do you understand?
you will be a considerate and thoughtful lover .
generous ... but firm .
failure on your part to live up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift resumption of a non sex situation .
right?
what?
shut up !
wake up , spud .
wake up .
sex !
casual sex !
tommy , put the tape on .
what?
i wanna watch ourselves while we're screwing .
so let's see what i'm missing .
not much !
'the captain , archie gemmill ,
'picking it up from the outside ...
'he's going all the way ... and he scores !
'oh , what a magnificent goal !
'gemmill at his very best .
'what a penetrating goal that was . '
i haven't felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978 .
right .
you can't sleep here .
what?
out !
come on !
you can sleep on the hall sofa or go home .
and don't make any noise .
jesus !
gone?
where has it gone?
it'll be here somewhere !
i might've returned it by mistake .
returned it? !
where?
the video shop , tommy?
the fucking video shop? !
so every punter in edinburgh's jerking off to our video?
oh , god , tommy , i feel sick !
hi .
hello .
fuck !
come in and sit down .
like some coffee?
aye .
you must be mark .
aye , that's me .
are you a friend of diane's?
more a friend of a friend .
right .
are you her flatmates , like?
flatmates? !
i must remember that one .
morning .
good morning , spud .
morning , gail .
mr houston .
mrs houston .
mornin ', spud .
sit down and have some breakfast .
i'm sorry about last night , by the way .
that's ok .
i slept fine on the sofa .
i had a bit much to drink .
had a bit of an accident .
dinnae worry .
does a man good to cut loose once in a while .
this one could do with being tied up .
i'll get the sheets washed .
i'll wash them .
no need .
it's no problem .
or for me .
i'd rather take care of it .
really ...
no !
spud , they're my sheets !
why not?
because it's illegal .
what , holding hands?
no , not holding hands .
you were quite happy
to do a lot more last night .
that's what's illegal !
inside , they'd cut my balls off .
you're not going to jail .
easy for you to say .
can i see you again?
certainly not !
if you don't see me again , i'll tell the police .
i'll see you around .
now what?
we're going for a walk .
a walk !
where?
there !
are you serious?
well , what are you waitin 'for?
tommy ... this is not natural , man .
it's the great outdoors !
fresh air !
we know lizzy's giving you a hard time .
don't take it out on us .
makes you proud to be scottish .
it's shite being scottish !
we're the lowest of the low .
the scum of the fuckin 'earth !
the most wretched , miserable , servile pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilisation !
some hate the english .
i don't they're just wankers .
we , on the other hand , are colonised by wankers .
can't even find a decent culture to be colonised by .
we're ruled by effete arseholes !
it's a shite state of affairs .
all the fresh air in the world won't make a fucking difference !
sorry , man .
it's no 'like ...
no , i appreciate it , tommy .
'around this time ,
'spud , sick boy and i
'made a healthy , informed , democratic decision
'to get back on heroin as soon as possible .
'took about twelve hours . '
paul newman , right , he were doing the world a favour ...
'looks easy , this .
it's not .
'looks like a doss , a soft option .
'but living like this is a full time business . '
ursula andress .
the quintessential bond girl that's what everyone says .
the embodiment , right , of his superiority to us .
beautiful ... exotic ... highly sexual yet ... totally unavailable to anyone apart from him .
shite !
let's face it , she'd shag one punter from edinburgh , she'd shag the whole fucking lot of us !
i knew he was gonna do that .
lizzy's gone , mark .
she's gone and fucking dumped me .
it was that video tape .
and that iggy pop business and other shite .
she told me where to go and no mistake .
i said to her ,
is there any chance of getting back together?
no way .
no fucking way .
honor blackman , aka pussy galore .
right?
what a total fucking misnomer !
i wouldnae touch her with yours !
i want to try it .
you're always going on about how it's the ultimate hit .
better than sex .
come on , man , i'm a fucking adult .
i can find out for myself .
i've got the money .
personality .
i mean , that's what counts , right?
personality .
that's what keeps a relationship going through the years .
like heroin .
i mean , heroin's got great fucking personality .
'swanney taught us
'to adore and respect the national health service .
'it was the source of much of our gear .
'we stole drugs .
'we stole prescriptions ,
'bought them , sold them , forged or photocopied them .
'or traded drugs with cancer victims , alcoholics ,
'old aged pensioners , alds patients ,
'epileptics and bored housewives .
'we took morphine , diamorphine ,
'cyclozine , codeine , temazepam ,
'nitrazepam , phenobarbitone ,
'sodium amytal , dextropropoxyphene , methadone ,
'nalbuphine , pethidine , pentazocine ,
'buprenorphine ,
'dextromoramide , chlormethiazole .
'the streets are awash with drugs
'you can have for unhappiness and pain .
'and we took them all .
'we would've injected vitamin c
'if they'd made it illegal ! '
the first day of the edinburgh festival
may i use your bathroom?
thank you .
now rent boy , no fucking skag .
'but the good times couldn't last forever . '
oh , my god , no !
please !
'i think allison had been screaming all day
'but it hadn't really registered before .
'she might have been screaming for a week .
'it was days since i'd heard anyone speak .
'though surely someone must have said something
'in all that time . '
allison?
allison !
help me , please !
cool down !
everything's gonna be just fine .
'nothing could've been further from the truth .
'in fact , nothing was gonna be just fine .
'on the contrary , everything was gonna be bad .
'everything was gonna be even worse than it already was . '
fuck !
'it wasn't my baby .
'she wasn't my baby .
'baby dawn she wasn't mine .
'spud's , swanney's ,
'sick boy's ...
'i dunno .
'maybe allison knew .
maybe not .
'i wished i could think of something to say
'something sympathetic ,
'something human . '
say something , mark .
fucking say something !
i'm cooking up .
cook us up a shot , rents .
i really need a hit .
'and so she did
'i could understand that .
'to take the pain away .
'so i cooked up
'and she got a hit .
'but only after me
'that went without saying .
'well , we knew who the father was now .
'it wasn't just the baby that died that day .
'something inside sick boy was lost and never returned .
'he had no theory to explain this moment .
nor did i.
'our only response was to keep going and fuck everything .
'pile misery on misery .
heat it on a spoon
'and dissolve it .
'then squirt it into a vein
'and do it all over again .
'keep on going out , robbing , fucking people over .
'propelling ourselves with longing
'towards the day it would all go wrong .
'because no matter how much you stash or steal ,
'you never have enough .
'no matter how often you go out and rob ,
'you always need to do it all over again .
'sooner or later ,
'this kind of thing was bound to happen . '
shoplifting is theft , which is a crime , and there is no such entity as victimless crime .
heroin addiction explains but doesn't excuse your actions .
mr murphy , you are a habitual thief , devoid of remorse .
i sentence you to six months 'imprisonment .
i worry it will not be long till we meet again .
mr renton , you have entered a programme of rehabilitation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin .
the suspension of your sentence depends on your continued cooperation with this programme .
stand guilty before me again and i won't hesitate to impose a custodial sentence .
thank you , your honour .
with god's help , i'll conquer this terrible affliction .
'what can you say?
'begbie had a phrase for it . '
it was obvious that cunt was gonna fuck some cunt .
have you learnt your lesson?
my son !
i thought i was gonna lose you .
you're nothing but trouble but i still love you !
clean up your fucking act .
cut that shite out .
francis is talking sense .
fucking right .
see , inside , you wouldn't last two days .
there's better things than the needle .
choose life .
my wee baby .
# oh , mamma's little baby ...
# loves shortening , shortening
# mamma's little baby loves shortening bread !
i'm sorry , mrs murphy .
it wasn't fair , spud going down and not me .
well , it's no 'our fault !
your boy went down because he was a smackhead .
if that's not your fault then i don't know what is .
i tried to get him off it .
i'll get the drinks in , eh?
'wish i'd gone down , not spud .
'here i was surrounded by my family
'and so called mates
'and i've never felt so alone .
'never in my puff .
'since i was on remand ,
'they've had me on this programme .
'the state sponsored addiction .
'three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day
'instead of smack .
it's never enough .
'right now , it's nowhere near enough .
'i took all three earlier .
'18 hours to my next shot
'and the sweat on my back's like a layer of frost .
'i need to visit the mother superior for one hit .
'one fucking hit
'to get us over this long , hard day . '
what's on the menu this evening , sir?
your favourite dish .
excellent .
usual table , sir?
why , thank you .
would sir care to pay for his bill in advance?
no , stick it on my tab .
credit limit was reached and breached some time ago .
well , in that case ...
ah , hard currency .
that'll do nicely .
can't be too careful when dealing with your type , sir .
would sir care for a starter?
some garlic bread?
no , thanks .
i'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs .
as you wish , sir .
as you wish .
perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?
open your eyes !
wake up !
come on , wake up !
'i don't feel the sickness yet
'but it's in the post , that's for sure .
'i'm in the junkie limbo at the moment .
'too ill to sleep ...
'too tired to stay awake . '
'but the sickness is on its way .
'sweat , chills , nausea ,
'pain and craving .
'need like nothing else i've ever known
'will soon take hold of me .
'it's on its way .
# ooh , you've got green eyes
# ooh , you've got blue eyes
# ooh , you've got grey eyes
# and i've never seen anyone
# quite like you before
# no , i've never met anyone
# quite like you before
we'll help you , son .
you stay here till you get better .
we'll beat this together .
i should go to the clinic .
no .
no clinics .
no methadone .
it made you worse .
you said so yourself .
you lied to us , son .
your own mother and father !
you can bring some jellies ...
no !
you're worse coming off that than you are with the heroin .
a clean break this time .
we'll keep an eye on you .
i appreciate what you're trying to do but just bring me one more hit , plea ...
i need one more fucking hit !
you fuck !
fuck it !
fuck it !
well ... this is a good fucking laugh , isn't it?
you sweat that shite out your system .
if i come back and it's still here ,
i'll fucking kick it out .
ok?
god !
question number one .
the human immunodeficiency virus is a ...?
retrovirus .
retrovirus is the right answer !
it's a mug's game , mrs renton .
i mean , i'm not saying i was blameless myself .
the time comes when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no .
just say no .
it's dawn !
she's dead !
not baby dawn .
question number two .
hlv binds to which receptor on the host lymphocyte?
which receptor is that?
cd4 .
cd4 is the right answer !
better than sex , rents?
better than sex?
the ultimate hit .
i'm a fucking adult ,
i can find out for myself .
well , i'm finding out , all right !
tommy !
stop it .
just fucking stop .
stop it .
is he guilty ... or not guilty?
mummy !
he's our son .
stop looking at me !
stop !
mark !
there's something you need to do .
come alive , 35 .
box of tricks , 66 .
mark !
mark , you've got a house !
house !
house !
for goodness sake , mark .
'it seems , however ,
'i really am the luckiest guy in the world .
'several years of addiction
'right in the middle of an epidemic ,
'surrounded by the living dead .
'but not me .
i'm negative .
'it's official .
'and once the pain goes ,
'that's when the real battle starts .
'depression , boredom
'you're so low , you want to top yourself . '
tommy !
tommy , it's mark , man .
all right , mate?
getting out much , tommy?
no .
following the game at all?
no .
nah .
me neither , really .
did you take the test?
aye .
clear?
aye .
that's nice .
i'm sorry , tommy .
you got any gear on you?
no .
i'm clean , man .
well ... sub us then , mate .
i'm expecting a rent cheque .
thanks , mark .
no bother .
'no bother .
'none at all .
'not for me , anyway .
'still , it's easy to be philosophical
'when it's some other poor cunt with shite for blood . '
what do you want?
are you clean?
yes .
is that a promise?
it is , actually !
i'm only asking .
is that hash i can smell?
no .
i wouldn't mind some .
it isn't .
it smells like it .
you're too young .
i'm too young for what?
you're not getting any younger , mark .
the world's changing , music's changing , even drugs are changing .
you can't stay in dreaming about heroin and ziggy pop .
it's iggy pop .
whatever .
the guy's dead , anyway .
iggy toured last year .
tommy went to see him .
the point is , you've got to find something new .
'she was right .
i had to find something new .
'only one thing for it . '
lifestyle letting agency .
a beautifully converted victorian townhouse .
'ideally located in a quiet road
'near to local shops .
'this one's two bedrooms and a kitchen/ diner .
'fully fitted .
excellent decorative order .
'lots of storage space , all mod cons .
'and it's going at ... 320 a week .
'i settled in not too badly ,
'kept myself to myself .
'sometimes i thought about the guys
'but mainly , i didn't miss them .
'this was boom town
'where any fool could make cash from chaos . '
i've got a beautifully converted victorian townhouse .
'i enjoyed the sound of it
'profit , loss , margins ,
'takeovers , lending , letting ,
'sub letting , sub dividing .
'cheating , scamming , breaking away . '
who's got the keys to talgarth road?
'if society existed , i had nothing to do with it .
'for the first time ,
'i was almost content . '
'dear mark ,
'glad you found a job and somewhere to live .
'school's fine at the moment .
'i'm not pregnant thanks for asking .
'sick boy wanted me to work for him .
'i told him where to go .
'met spud .
he sends his regards .
'i think that's what he said . '
tell marky ...
tell him ...
'no one has seen tommy for ages .
'and francis begbie has been on tv a lot .
'he's wanted by the police
'because of an armed robbery in a jeweller's .
'take care .
yours , with love , diane . '
'francis begbie ... '
armed robbery?
how could it be armed robbery with a fucking replica?
a scandal .
and the gear .
look .
supposed to be solid silver it's fucking garbage !
there's young couples invest all their hopes in that stuff .
it's a scandal .
fucking right .
another one of the wee pot noodles?
i'm fucking lee marvin !
hey , rents .
'begbie settled in in no time at all . '
i've no fucking cigarettes .
aye , right .
it's me .
rents !
'yeah , the guy's a psycho .
'but it's true
'he's a mate an 'all so what can you do? '
nip down the bookies and put a line on for us .
can you no 'go yourself?
seeing as i'm a fugitive from the law and i cannae walk the fucking streets , you go .
here .
doncaster .
four forty .
five pound to win bad boy .
fucking ...
bring some fucking beer an 'all .
come on , bad boy .
come on , son .
come on , son .
bad boy !
'came in at 16 to one .
'and with the winnings ,
'diane was right
'the world is changing .
'music is changing ,
'drugs are changing .
men and women are changing .
'one thousand years from now ,
'there'll be no guys or girls , just wankers .
'sounds great to me .
'it's just a pity no one told begbie . '
fuck !
fuck !
'we're heterosexual by default , not by decision .
'it's just a question of who you fancy .
'it's all about aesthetics and fuck all to do with morality . '
fuck !
'but you try telling begbie that . '
i'm not a fucking buftie !
it could have been wonderful .
fucking listen to me , piece of junkie shit !
you mention that again and i'll cut you up .
you understand?
'since i last saw him ,
'sick boy had reinvented himself
'as a pimp and a pusher .
'and was here , he said , to mix business and pleasure .
'setting up contacts
'for the great skag deal
'that was one day gonna make him rich . '
good chips .
i can't believe you did that .
i got a good price for it .
i need the money .
it was my fucking telly !
if i'd known you'd get so humpty about it ,
i wouldn't have bothered .
fucking rented , anyway .
you gonna eat that?
have you got a passport?
why?
i met this bloke .
runs a hotel ...
brothel .
loads of contacts .
does a nice side line in punting british passports to foreigners .
get you a good price .
and why would i want to sell my passport?
it was just an idea .
'i had to get rid of them .
'sick boy didn't do his drug deal and didn't get rich .
'he and begbie hung around my bedsit looking to steal things .
'i decided to put them in the worst place in the world . '
'but of course , they weren't paying any rent .
'so when my boss found two suckers who would ,
'sick boy and begbie were bound to feel threatened . '
lots of storage .
all mod cons .
320 quid a week .
'and that was that .
'but we had another reason to go back .
tommy . '
tommy knew he had the virus but not that he'd gone full blown .
was it pneumonia or cancer?
no toxoplasmosis .
it's like a stroke .
how's that?
he wanted to see lizzy again .
she wouldn't let him near the house .
so he bought her a present .
this kitten .
bet lizzy told him where to fuckin 'stick it .
i don't want a cat , " she says .
so there's tommy stuck with this kitten .
you can imagine what happened .
to those gathered here today ,
thomas mckenzie filled a number of roles in our lives ...
the thing was neglected .
pissing and shitting all over .
tommy's lying about fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers .
he never knew you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit .
he had a great lust for life .
neither did i. what is it?
fucking horrible .
it's like an abscess on your brain .
fucking hell .
then what happened?
he starts getting headaches .
so he uses more smack , you know , for the pain , like .
and then he has a stroke .
a fucking stroke !
just like that .
gets home from the hospital and dies three weeks later .
he'd been dead for ages before neighbours complained about the smell and got the police to break down the door .
tommy was lying in a pool of vomit .
the kitten was fine .
all please rise for the committal .
# did you think i would leave you crying
# when there's room on my horse for two?
# climb up here , tommy
# don't be dying
# i can go just as fast with two
# when we grow up
# we'll both be soldiers
# and our horses will not be toys
# and i wonder if we'll remember
# when we were two little boys
did you tell him yet?
on you go .
what?
swanney's mate ...
you know him mikey forrester .
aye .
he's come into some gear .
a lot of gear .
how much gear?
about two kilos .
so he tells me .
he got drunk in a pub by the docks last week .
met two russian sailors .
they're fucking carrying the stuff .
for sale there and then , like .
he wakes up next morning , realises what he's done , gets very nervous .
he wants rid of this .
so?
so , he met me .
i offered to take it at a reasonable price so i could punt it on to a guy in london .
we're just back from tommy's funeral and you're discussing a skag deal?
aye .
what was your price?
four grand .
you haven't got four grand .
we're 2, 000 short .
well , that's tough .
mark , every cunt knows you've been saving up down in london .
i don't have two grand .
you fucking do .
i've seen your bank statement .
for fuck's sake !
two thousand , one hundred and thirty three pound .
two kilos .
what's that , ten years?
mikey forrester , russian sailors what the fuck are you on?
spud , you've been to jail .
you want to go back?
i just want the money .
keep your mouths shut and no cunt goes to jail .
'there were a lot of possibilities
'running through my mind
'about what might happen in london .
'things i didn't want to talk to anyone about .
'ideas best kept to myself .
'what no one told me was that when we bought the skag ,
'some lucky punter would have to try it out .
'begbie didn't trust spud
'and sick boy was too careful these days .
'so i rolled up my sleeve ,
'i spiked my vein
'and i did what had to be done . '
it's good .
oh , it's really fucking good !
'that hit was good .
'i promised myself another before i got to london .
'just one , for old time's sake .
'just to piss begbie off .
'this was his nightmare .
'the dodgiest scam in a life of dodgy scams .
'being perpetrated with three of the most useless
'and unreliable fuck ups in town .
'i knew what was going on in his mind
'any trouble in london and he would dump us .
'if he got caught with a bag of skag
'on top of that armed robbery , he'd go down for 15 to 20 .
'begbie was hard but not so hard
'that he didn't shite it off 20 years in saughton .
'this was to be my final hit .
'but let's be clear
'there's final hits and final hits .
'what kind was this to be? '
did you bring the cards?
what?
i told you to mind the cards .
i've not brought them .
it's fucking boring without the cards .
i'm sorry .
bit fucking late , like .
why didn't you bring them?
i told you to , doss cunt !
christ !
these your friends , right?
these are the guys i told you about .
well , is he here?
yeah , he's here .
you didn't get followed or nothing?
didn't get followed .
ok .
all right?
hi .
'straight away ,
'he saw what we were .
'small time wasters with an accidental big deal . '
excuse me , gentlemen .
so ... how much would you like for this?
20, 000 .
i don't think it's worth much more than 15 .
'he didn't need to negotiate .
'what would we do if he didn't buy it?
'sell it on the streets?
fuck that . '
well , 19 .
i'm terribly sorry .
i can't go to 19 .
well , fucking 16 then .
ok .
well , fucking 16 it is , then .
these , gentlemen , are 2, 000 bundles .
that's two ...
that's four ...
'we settled on 16, 000 .
'he'd a lot more in his suitcase
'but it was better than nothing . '
thank you , gentlemen .
may i say it's been a pleasure haggling with you .
fucking brand new .
'for a moment ,
'it felt great .
'like we were in it together ,
'like it meant something .
'a moment like that can touch you
'but it doesn't last long .
not like 16, 000 . '
spud , any investments planned?
gonna buy an island in the sun?
for 4, 000?
one palm tree and a sewage outflow !
i don't know , man .
i'm gonna get something for my ma .
and some good speed .
no bicarb .
get a girl , take her out , treat her right ...
and shag her?
no , man !
true love .
true love .
but i could handle hot sex with a jewish princess tonight !
ya daft cunt !
or a catholic .
don't waste it .
get the drinks .
i got a round already .
i got the last one .
your round , franco .
ok .
same again?
i'm off for a piss .
see when i get back , that money's still here , ok?
no , we're out the door .
i'll be after you .
you'll never catch us , flabby .
but when i get back ...
be halfway down the street with the money .
i'd fucking kill you .
i thought you might .
thought you might .
are you game for it?
what?
well?
are you serious?
don't know .
don't know .
what d'you think?
still here , i see .
oh , aye .
wouldn't run out on a mate .
i would .
where's franco?
for fuck's sake !
sorry .
i'll buy you another .
you ruined my fucking suit , you fucking idiot !
i'm sorry .
sorry " won't dry me off , you cunt .
he says he's sorry .
not sorry enough for being a fat cunt .
you can't even hold a pint .
now fuck off !
no , franco , no ...
for fuck's sake !
fucking nice one , franco
you cut me , man !
you were in my way .
anybody else wanna get in my fucking way?
you?
hey , rent boy , bring me down a fucking smoke .
we'd better go .
to hospital .
you're not going to hospital .
stay there .
you bring me down a fucking cigarette .
and the bag .
'now i've justified this to myself
'in all sorts of ways .
'it wasn't a big deal
'just a minor betrayal .
'or we'd outgrown each other ,
'that sort of thing .
'but let's face it , i ripped them off
'my so called mates .
'but begbie , i couldn't give a shit about him .
'and sick boy , he'd have done the same to me ,
'if he'd only thought of it first .
'and spud ...
well , ok , i felt sorry for spud .
'he never hurt anybody .
bastard !
move away , everybody .
what's going on in there?
open up .
open up now !
'so why did i do it?
'i could offer a million answers , all false .
'the truth is that i'm a bad person .
'but that's gonna change .
'i'm going to change .
this is the last of that .
'now i'm cleaning up , going straight and choosing life .
'i'm looking forward to it .
'i'm gonna be just like you
'the job , the family , the fucking big television ,
'the washing machine , the car , the compact disc .
'good health , low cholesterol ,
'mortgage , starter home , leisure wear , luggage ,
'three piece suite , dly .
'game shows , junk food , children .
'walks in the park , nine to five ,
'good at golf , washing the car , choice of sweaters .
'family christmas , indexed pension , tax exemption .
'clearing the gutters , getting by
'looking ahead , the day you die . '
