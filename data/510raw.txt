malone !
williams , what is it?
what did we hit?
i don't know .
there's something in the water .
clear us now , williams .
hold steady , wayne .
there's something down there .
clear it away .
i can't see anything .
williams .
hey , out there .
you've got the one and only stevie wayne ... ... broadcasting from my own little corner of the world ... ... high in the kab lighthouse on antonio island .
it is perfect weather for this week's dedication of the new statue ... ... honoring the memory of antonio bay's founding fathers .
so get on down to the town hall and check out the monument ... ... to those four brave men .
one of whom was my great great grandfather ... ... richard wayne .
did i already mention that?
david williams .
patrick malone .
norman castle .
richard wayne .
it's all wrong .
oh , come on , kathy .
who cares which one holds the telescope .
it's a spyglass , tom .
david williams is supposed to be holding it .
he was the visionary .
we've gotta get this right .
the four of them rode out against impossible odds ... ... to defend this island with their lives .
i know , i know .
through the fog .
the malone family name is on that statue , tom .
it has to be accurate .
we've got tourists arriving on friday .
what do you wanna do , send it back?
fine .
we'll have the unveiling tomorrow ... ... and i'll send it back at the end of the season .
look around you , boys .
this is god's country .
anywhere you go on earth sea of cortez , nantucket sound ... ... gulf of mexico . you'll never find better fishing than what we had here .
sushi?
no .
i'm good , thanks .
nice speech .
and you've been to how many of those places?
not a one .
my dad used to tell me stories .
he was the traveler .
sure is a long way out to find the sandbar .
well , this is where the ocean floor is .
which is where the kelp and the little fish are ... ... which is why you got some big fish here today .
mr. spooner?
sir?
let's weigh the anchor , call it a day .
yes , sir .
damn .
hey , yo , nick .
we're snagged on something .
spooner?
you all right?
the winch is jammed .
i can't shut it off .
shut it down .
i'm trying to .
spooner .
spooner .
nick , get up here .
give it some slack .
i'm trying to , all right?
the winch is stuck .
hey , i lost all my fish .
we're going down .
we're not going down .
spooner .
can't get it .
it's not coming loose .
you guys okay?
yeah .
see?
you got a little something there .
sorry about the mishap .
come back and see us again .
yeah , we'll be back .
what?
they said they'd be back .
they they i believe them .
i was convinced , when they said ... ... " we'll be back , " they had the " i'll be back " face .
hey , yo , nick .
yeah , in here .
i don't suppose they left a brother a tip .
yeah , right .
hey , you know that wasn't my fault , right?
don't do that again .
damn , you sexy as hell when you're mad .
it's incredible .
where you going?
we got decks to swab .
i'm going to little ray's to get a clutch for the one you broke .
i broke it?
make sure you end up at little ray's .
don't end up at little stevie's .
that was a one time thing .
all three times?
because i remember the lighthouse , then the time in the field .
oh , let's not forget about the little church parking lot , choir boy .
twice .
it was twice .
twice all three times?
your point is?
really don't have one .
but she does know elizabeth .
what if she blabs?
elizabeth ... ... is 3000 miles away .
she's been gone for six months .
distance is not a factor .
women have testicle telepathy , man .
hose down the boat , lock it up ...
... so we don't go out of business .
" we "?
we need to book another charter to make money .
i got a idea .
why don't you do some work here ... ... and i'll get the clutch .
i'm the skipper , and you're gilligan .
like that?
after all that " we , " now i'm just gilligan?
and i'm by myself , huh?
so that's it , huh?
how much that cost?
a heartfelt tribute to the founding fathers of antonio bay .
could've used that money down at the marina .
new sea wall , shore up that pier .
these four men built this town out of nothing .
without their sacrifice , there wouldn't be a marina or a pier .
ln honoring the past , we celebrate the present .
i never understood that line myself .
and i'm sure you never will , nicholas .
mrs. williams .
gonna come to the unveiling?
your family's name is on that statue .
i can't help that , can l?
oh , no .
adrift .
north by northwest swells past the break .
otherwise , you've got fair winds and flat waters .
oh , and me , your lighthouse keeper , stevie wayne .
voice that launched a thousand ships .
so if you're not in the mood ... ... turn it down , because i'm gonna turn it up ... ... on 94 . 5 , kab ... ... your island alternative to the modern music establishment .
playing the music i wanna hear .
want a ride?
wrong direction .
not anymore .
you're not a freak , are you?
yeah , actually , i am .
good .
shit .
i leave town , you start picking up strange girls on the road .
elizabeth?
no , no .
i recognized you .
i haven't been gone that long , nick .
i knew it was you .
so you're back .
no place like home .
only took you six months to figure that out .
i just need to come back for a while .
and , nick ... ... next time open the door for a lady .
ahoy , mateys .
another perfect moonlit eve here on the isle ... ... and you're listening to stevie wayne ... ... your very own beacon in the night .
oh , shit .
can't say that on regular radio but what the hell .
i can say whatever i want .
it's my very own station .
listen up .
got a low tide warning in the a . m . for you .
and as i check my lighthouse gauges ... ... looks like the old barometer is on the rise .
so it could be , dan the weatherman might just be right for a change .
hey , yo , sean .
get your ass up here and take the helm .
one second , ladies .
yeah .
my turn to play .
this is my cousin's boat , man .
well , nick's not here , is he?
huh?
you see your cousin?
that sucks .
why do i have to drive?
because i'm the skipper , and you're gilligan .
oh , right .
ladies , the spooner wait is over .
yeah .
booty on the boat , the new reality show .
mandi and brandi , the twins .
we're not twins .
my name's jennifer .
sean , they're not twins .
neither are we .
so we can do this now .
you swear y'all ain't twins?
you know you girls could model?
i could hook you up .
right after this little audition tape .
i just gotta pick up a part for the seagrass .
it'll just take a second .
and , you , don't go anywhere , all right?
you know the difference between flotsam and jetsam?
machen .
people get washed up on shore .
some bob around at sea forever .
you used to be elizabeth .
i still am .
i have something to show you .
lf you touch it , things will change .
it's still ticking .
it wasn't ticking before .
where'd you get it?
from the sea .
came back .
sooner or later , everything does .
do you have a lighter?
yeah .
it's a hallmark .
tells where a piece was made and roughly when .
looks familiar .
elizabeth .
farewell , elizabeth .
what was that about?
he found a watch on the beach .
that guy gives me the creeps .
i know it sounds crazy , but i felt like i'd seen it somewhere before .
where?
i don't know .
let's go .
hey , andy .
hey , darling .
hey , dan .
you lonely over there without me?
remind me why i gave you my cell phone number again?
because i'm 6 feet of burning love .
actually you're 5'9 " , dan .
now tell me why you called , or i'm gonna hang up .
okay , okay .
i just thought you might like something to talk about .
okay .
i'm listening .
i got something on my doppler a minute ago .
sounds kinky .
looks like a fog bank about 1 0 miles out ... ... and it's moving straight towards us .
well , my gauges must be wrong then .
i'm showing a wind blowing due west .
now , what kind of fog moves against the wind?
you got me .
but my radar doesn't lie .
gotta go .
i'm on .
okay .
it is just before 1 0 on spivey point .
this is stevie wayne , beaming my signal across the sea .
dan the weatherman says a fog bank is rolling in offshore .
so if i were you , i would lock the doors ... ... throw away the keys and whip up a pitcher of martinis ... ... while you listen to another hour of music on kab .
serving up the platters that matter .
there's no fog out there .
hey , spooner .
you see any fog out there?
there's no fog out here .
ladies , you see any fog?
i don't see any fog out there .
did they talk about beautiful women?
because that's definitely out here .
look at this .
blurring my vision .
spooner , the engine's dead .
nobody care about that .
you know why?
because we got beer .
and for two , we got beer .
and after that , beer .
and we got music too .
that's all that matter , all right?
dance over here and have some fun .
look at that .
my lord .
yeah .
yeah .
you all wanna see spooner get low?
let me get low .
harbor patrol , this is seagrass .
do you copy?
coast guard , this is seagrass .
do you copy?
over .
damn .
wait a second .
this new radio is ....
i don't know why it does this .
it's that new song that starts with the static .
it starts with static then it goes to the beat and music .
wait a second .
what are you doing?
no coats .
coats , bad .
naked , good .
it's freezing out there .
what's going on?
hell of a fog bank .
where'd that come from?
hey , spooner .
what's going on out there , man?
spooner .
dude , do you see this?
so i guess new york is just , like , the best thing ever , huh?
i wouldn't say that .
well , you happy there?
sometimes .
i don't know , nick .
what do you want me to say?
i don't know .
i wake up one morning and you're gone .
no note , nothing .
i don't belong on this island , nick .
the thing i always loved most about you ... ... is you were the one person who understood that .
the day you left , i bought you something .
what?
a ring .
you bought me a ring?
no .
but i thought about it .
you're such a liar .
are you okay?
i think so .
what the hell was that?
murderers .
nothing but murderers .
blood for blood .
father malone .
nicholas .
elizabeth .
did you see what happened back there?
i ....
did something hit us?
i didn't see anything .
looking for my car .
it's around here somewhere .
i can't ....
sure you're all right?
yeah .
man , i can't see nothing .
what's going on?
these ....
the hell did you do?
nothing .
i just called for help .
oh , my god .
there's something right in front of us .
look at that .
stop .
screaming will get nothing done .
you all right?
calm down .
just get us out of here , please .
you're all right .
you'll be okay , all right?
are there any lights anywhere?
wait .
one second .
you okay?

hello?
sean .
sean .

there was a big sailing ship .
y'all didn't see that ship?
no .
i'm trying to tell you ....
it was right here .
let's just see what the hell happened to the engine .
jennifer , what are you doing?
what the hell was that?
i don't know .
i don't know .
dude , let's fix it and get out of here .
what the hell is that?
don't know .
somebody in there?
you sure you wanna go in there?
my mom will kill me if i don't .
call you tomorrow?
good luck .
hello?
who's there?
it's me .
well ....
this is a surprise .
a good one?
don't see any suitcases .
i guess that means you're not moving back .
i thought you'd be happy i came back at all .
i wish you'd called me . l
i mean , it's not like i'm running a hotel here .
good to see you too , mom .
you waited .
you lasted 30 seconds longer than i thought you would .
you're learning .
did you say hello for me?
so where to now?
let's go to your place .
for some wild and crazy sex?
with a strange hitchhiker?
you wish .
elizabeth?
hey .
hey , it's what is it?
what's wrong?
i ....
i keep seeing people ... ... burning .
and they're screaming .
and i'm watching , and then ...
and then i'm drowning .
it's just a dream .
it's just a dream .
i've been having them a lot .
it's why i came home .
come here .
come on .
elizabeth .
elizabeth .
elizabeth .
elizabeth .
you okay?
what are you doing down here?
it's freezing .
come on .
let's go back to bed .
mom .
mom , wake up .
look what i found .
andy , what is that?
i found it on the beach between some rocks .
it's heavy .
feel .
looks like it must've been somebody's hairbrush once upon a time .
want me to make you some breakfast?
no , i wanna go back down to the beach .
fine , just a half an hour , okay?
i have to go into work early .
i have a very busy day .
can i come to the station with you?
no .
not today , hon .
i have too much work to do .
but maybe later in the week , okay?
how's that?
maybe aunt connie'll go to the beach with you and help you find more stuff .
no .
all she does is eat ding dongs and watch jeopardy !
i love you .
love you too , mom .
it's usually after a storm when anything's washed up on the beach .
yeah , but we haven't had a storm in months .
it's an interesting piece , isn't it?
yeah , it is .
i'll let you know .
thanks .
oh , this is a beautiful piece .
lf it washes up on the beach , it's ours now , right?
well , technically speaking .
so , what's it worth?
hey , nick .
stevie , how you doing?
great .
i hear your girl's back in town .
yeah , she is .
she's back .
good .
she's gonna be here a while?
who knows .
yeah , who knows .
saved by the bell .
hello?
hey , uncle hank .
elizabeth?
mr. latham .
it is you .
how are you , dear?
good .
god , we missed you around here .
what are you up to?
this stamp .
i feel like i've seen it somewhere before .
you recognize it at all?
no .
can't say i do .
but i know prince william lsland .
it was a big trading post up north .
gold , seal furs , fox pelts .
they traded with shanghai for spices and jade .
a lot of people got rich in a hurry .
so then why did they stop production suddenly in 1 8 7 1?
nobody lived there after the outbreak .
what outbreak?
leprosy .
the chinese brought it over .
wiped out half the island .
the other half left by ship .
that's as much as i know .
they never came back .
elizabeth .
nick , what's wrong?
hank just called .
spooner took the seagrass out and never came back .
we gotta go .
like i said on the phone ... ... l saw them head out last night at 8 : 30 .
haven't been heard from since .
and no one's seen her?
not that i've heard .
i gotta call the coast guard , nick .
don't do that just yet .
they ....
they're probably just ... ... anchored up the channel somewhere .
we'll go find them .
can we use your boat?
sure .
thanks .
spooner !
spooner?
maybe somebody picked him up .
let's hope .
look at this .
the gauges are all smashed .
got a half a tank of gas .
the engine still works .
spooner?
sean?
sean?
nick?
nick , what's wrong?
sean .
he's dead .
what?
his eyes ....
what?
he's dead .
no !
oh , god .
oh , god .
go inside .
call for help .
mayday .
mayday .
hello?
no !
highs in the 60s , with lows down into the 40s .
in late breaking news , local fisherman nick castle ... ... discovered three dead and one injured ... ... on his boat , the seagrass , which had gone missing in last night's fog .
what?
the victims 'names ... ... have not yet been released .
jennifer !
let me go .
jennifer .
did he say anything to you two?
not a word .
mayor , you still want me to lock him up?
lock him up for what?
you saw the bodies .
you think they got that way by accident?
tom , coast guard wants you on the radio .
you tell your pal , when he thaws out he better have a damn good story .
i hid from it .
you hid from what?
it killed them .
the fog killed them .
i hid in the freezer .
it couldn't get in the freezer .
all right , spooner , just relax .
you're not making any sense .
you'll be all right .
okay , guys , we'll take care of him .
okay , come on .
it's gonna be all right .
it's okay now .
it's okay .
the fog killed them?
look .
i found this on the boat .
take it .
keep it safe .
it's a piece of evidence .
it might prove that spooner's innocent .
just keep it safe .
okay .
let's see .
so you like your gift?
i think it's more for you than it is for me , dan .
it's pretty cool , though , huh?
if i wanted people to see me , i wouldn't have gone into radio .
over and out .
you hear about the seagrass?
yeah .
yeah , i did .
well , i gotta go .
call me later , okay?
i will .
somebody please beam me out of here .
look at that .
beautiful women cavorting around half naked .
this new radio is ....
i don't know why it does this .
we're going inside .
no , no .
oh , god .
it's freezing .
wait .
i've got it , aunt connie .
hello?
andy .
it's me .
i need you to chill out and listen to me , okay?
okay .
where did you find the brush?
on the beach .
down by the big rock .
andy , i don't want you to pick up anything else from the beach ... ... unless i'm with you .
understand?
why?
andy .
jeez .
okay , i promise .
bye .
bye .
what'd your mother want , andy?
oh , nothing .
can i go down to the beach?
well , just be back before dark , dear .
i will .
father malone?
father?
father malone?
elizabeth .
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to interrupt you .
oh , no , no .
it's ....
it's all right .
what happened?
i don't know .
what do the words mean?
it's a phrase from the bible .
it's ....
it's the writing on the wall .
what have you got there?
i was wondering if you could help me .
it has your family name in it .
my grandfather told me about this .
where'd you get it?
ln the boathouse , hidden in the wall .
the boathouse?
which one?
nick's .
nick castle .
of course .
i'm sorry , elizabeth , i really can't help you .
something's happening , isn't it , father?
i'm very busy right now .
maybe you should come back another time .
what's happening , father?
look , you should get off the island .
what?
i said , go .
found this on the seagrass .
they figure it's the knife that killed sean .
but that's that's my knife .
nick .
elizabeth , what happened?
can we talk outside?
no .
it's not a good time .
it's important .
i can't .
i can't right now .
spooner's really in trouble .
just give me a minute .
blood for blood .
elizabeth .
what the hell's going on here?
what happened?
are you okay?
thanks .
here .
drink this .
it'll help you relax .
i don't wanna relax .
you don't believe me , do you?
elizabeth , three people were just found dead on my boat ... ... my business is shot , and malone's trying to nail spooner for murder .
what do you want me to do?
you think i would make all this up?
i didn't say that .
it's not just me , nick .
father malone's leaving .
and spooner wasn't lying .
he didn't touch sean .
i saw it on the tape .
where is the tape?
let me see it .
i lost it .
you what?
i know .
it fell in the water .
when you were drowning?
i know how this sounds , okay?
yeah , it's a really good thing you found this .
nick , ever since i came home , horrible things have been happening .
the answers are in here somehow .
just
just look at it .
it describes my dream , nick .
all of it .
one of the founding fathers wrote it .
patrick malone .
'may god forgive my soul . '
i say these words , but in my heart i wonder ... ... can god forgive any man for a sin as great as the one i'm about to commit?
wait a second , let me see this .
i tell myself this is the only means by which our family can survive ... ... the conditions on this beleaguered island .
but it does not soothe the horror i feel for being an accomp
accomplice to what?
what is it?
these photographs .
the dates .
1 867 , '69 .
just shacks , huts , cabins .
then 1 8 7 1 .
a town springs up .
look at these .
it's the same thing here .
look how much everything's grown .
something definitely happened in 1 8 7 1 .
same date as the journal .
what turned it all around?
malone .
williams .
castle .
wayne .
are we resolved to protect this island?
aye .
i was outside the door , like you said .
must've gone out the window .
you think?
oh , my .
hi , dan .
so , what is it this time?
a swarm of locusts?
a tornado maybe?
nope .
just fog .
you're kidding , right?
no .
it swallowed us up out here at the station a couple of minutes ago .
it's moving your way .
it's kind of cool , actually .
hang on a sec .
oh , man .
all the lights just went out .
everything's dead .
everything but your computer , right?
batteries .
lucky me .
dan , where'd you go?
that's great .
dan?
dan?
what is that?
what's happening?
someone's at the door .
dan ... ... listen to me .
don't open the door .
i'm just gonna check this out .
hang on a second , sweetheart .
yeah , just give me a second here , all right?
dan , don't open the door .
don't worry about me , darling .
big dan's got everything under control .
dan?
dan , is everything all right?
dan?
this some kind of joke?
that's weird .
dan?
chris?
" shorts " for 2000 .
andy?
please pick up .
please pick up .
please pick up .
inez?
what is borneo?
hello?
hello?
hello?
and all of us living here today owe a debt of gratitude ... ... to these four brave men ... ... who struggled and withstood and sacrificed ... ... in order that this island might grow and prosper into what it is today .
oh , god , andy .
maybe we should close all the windows .
you better check your bedroom .
i'll go check your mother's .
it wants us .
this is really weird .
i'll go get the truck .
i think it's just a power outage .
i'm sure it's temporary .
i think it's best that everybody just go home .
i don't think it's anything to worry about .
all right .
you heard the mayor .
let's call it a night .
this is an emergency .
there's been a fire at the weather station .
dan has been killed . lf anybody can hear me , please check on my son .
the phone lines are down .
please check on my son .
there is something in the fog .
please .
i cannot reach him .
he's at 88 7 white beach road .
mommy's coming , andy .
mommy's coming .
elizabeth , get in .
stevie's son's in trouble .
we gotta go .
i heard her on the radio .
come on .
april 1 0th .
met with blake tonight for the first time .
he stood in the shadows to prevent me from seeing his face .
who's blake?
i don't know .
nick , listen to this .
blake's proposition is simple .
he wishes to purchase half of the island as a new home for his people .
he and his followers are traveling down the coast ... ... in a clipper ship called the elizabeth dane .
spooner said he saw a clipper ship last night in the fog .
nick , watch out !
god .
come on .
damn it .
come on .
come on .
oh , come on .
we're not gonna make it .
it's coming up the coast .
we're going the back way .
elizabeth , turn the truck around .
keep it running .
come on .
andy , get out of there .
get out of there .
come on .
grab my hand .
come on , run .
let's go get in the truck .
go on , get in the truck .
we gotta get out of here .
go , go , go .
let's go .
elizabeth , let's go .
come on .
put it in gear , we gotta get out of here .
shit .
go .
come on !
it's stuck .
go .
what the hell is that?
come on , i don't know .
you trade with me .
slide over .
nick .
nick , look out !
where are we going?
to the lighthouse , to your mom .
then we're getting off this island .
we have to go to the town hall to get my mother .
she was just there .
try the marina loop .
maybe we'll make it through .
i ain't sticking around here , waiting to get killed .
i'm the hell off this island .
all packed up , huh?
i don't think the ferry's running tonight .
you been drinking?
it means , " you've been weighed in the balance and found wanting .
i'll take that as a yes .
i need a drink myself .
i figure one of these keys goes to one of these boats .
we could
oh , my god .
come on .
come on .
it's too thick .
i can't see through this .
our journey's over .
we are almost home .
the contract , mr. malone .
a new home .
where's the rest?
we've come for all of it , mr. blake .
you give us everything , and you escape here with your wretched lives .
that's not the deal we made , mr. malone .
well , that matters little now , mr. blake .
elizabeth?
nick?
elizabeth?
elizabeth?
nick?
where are you?
stay there .
i can see you .
elizabeth .
i'm sorry .
i don't know what it is .
elizabeth .

so now you know .
that our forefathers murdered every man , woman and child ... ... on the elizabeth dane?
and this town was built on nothing but lies?
and now they've come for their revenge .
they're everywhere .
the land that blake paid for ... ... where is it?
we're on it .
the whole town was built on it .
the sins of the fathers are visited on the heads of the children .
the hell are you talking about?
the ramblings of a dying old man .
my grandfather knew the truth about his ancestors .
my father was a madman .
we're the children of murderers .
all of us .
wayne , castle , williams , malone .
but we haven't done anything .
yeah , keep my father out of this .

elizabeth .
elizabeth?
i don't think any of us can say exactly what happened last night .
but if this ... ... has been anything more than just a nightmare ... ... then why?
did it come back for revenge ... ... or justice?
or maybe to claim something lost long , long ago .
maybe we'll never know .
but one thing's for sure ... ... something did come back from the sea .
sooner or later , everything does .
