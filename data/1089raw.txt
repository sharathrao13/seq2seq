jesus .
hey , where's the fire?
amos ain't home till midnight .
freddie?
fred?
hey , you know ,
i don't want you to feel like i m nagging at you or anything , but don't you think it's about time that i met your friend down at the onyx?
i mean , it's been a month since you told him about me .
i know .
'cause that was the night velma kelly , plugged her husband and her sister .
you know , they say that she found them in the kip together .
gosh , if i ever found
amos soapin 'it to somebody else ...
boy , i'd throw him a party .
a big , big going away party .
it s getting late .
i have been thinking a lot about my act , though .
whenever i get a good idea , i write it down in my diary before it goes out of my head .
and you know what occurred to me?
the other day ... that ... all the really really knock out acts have something a little different going on , you know?
like , a signature band .
and i thought my thing could be .. " aloof " ... you know?
give them just enough to get them good and hungry but always leave them wanting more .
once i get a name for myself , maybe maybe we can open up a club of our own , you know?
you could run it , and i could be the headliner .
oh , get off .
what's the idea?
wake up , kiddo , you ain't never gonna have an act .
says who?
face it , roxie .
you're a two bit talent with skinny legs .
and i'm just a furniture salesman .
yeah , but you got connections , you know .
that guy down at the club ...
there's no guy .
yeah , that night ...
it was the first time i set foot in that joint .
i was collecting on a bet from the trombone player .
so you never told anyone about me?
sugar , you are hot stuff .
i would have said anything to get a piece of that .
so now what? ...
now?
we had some laughs .
let's just leave it at that .
fred ...
you can't do this to me .
you get off !
you touch me again , i il put your lights out .
wait ...
your husband will be home soon , why don't you wash yourself before you go hitting those sheets again .
you're a liar , fred .
oh , yeah , so what?
you lied to me ...
that's life , sweetheart .
that's life .
you son of a bitch ...
you son of a bitch !
you son of a bitch !
why are you bothering , sal?
this one's all wrapped up .
i hear it's a new city record .
from killing to confession in an hour flat .
why did you get the murder weapon?
i keep a gun in the underwear drawer .
just in case of trouble , you know .
that's just fine .
sign right there , mr. hart .
freely and gladly .
freely and gladly .
and mind you don't say we beat it out of you when you get up on the witness stand .
no , i give myself up .
surrendered of my own free will .
isn't he the cheerful murderer !
shooting a burglar ain't murder .
just last week a jury thanked a man .
i m always grateful for citizens who know the law .
get in there .
you too .
sit down .
okay , from the top .
a man has got a right to protect his home and his loved ones , right?
of course he has .
i come home from the garage , and i see him climbing through the window .
with my wife roxie laying there , sleeping like an angel .
is that true , mrs. hart?
i m telling you , it's the god's honest truth .
my wife has nothing to do with it .
she won't hurt a worm .
not even a worm .
it wasn't until i fired the first shot , then she even opened her eyes .
boy she's some heavy sleeper , i always said she could sleep through the st. patty's day parade .
when i think of what would have happened if i went out for a beer with the guys instead of coming straight home ...
it makes me sick even to think about it ...
for her first number , miss roxie hart would like to sing a song of love and devotion .
dedicated to her dear husband , amos .
* sometimes i'm right *
* sometimes i'm wrong *
* but he doesn't care *
* he'll string along *
* he loves me so *
* that funny honey of mine *
* sometimes i'm down *
* sometimes i'm up *
* but he follows 'round *
* like some droopy eyed pup *
* he love me so *
* that funny honey of mine *
like i said , even after i shot him , he kept coming at me .
so i had to pull the trigger again .
* he ain't no sheik *
* that's no great physique *
* and lord knows * * he ain't got the smarts *
* but look at that soul *
* i tell you that whole *
* is a whole lot greater *
* than the sum of his parts *
* and if you knew him like me *
* i know you'd agree *
* what if the world *
* slandered my name? *
* why he'd be right there *
* taking the blame *
* he loves me so *
* and it all suits me fine *
* that funny sunny honey *
* hubby of mine *
i mean suppose if ... just suppose that he had violated her or something .
you know what i mean , violated?
i know what you mean .
or something .
think how terrible that would have been .
it s good thing i got home from work on time .
* he loves me so * i'm telling you that .
* that funny honey of mine * i say i m telling you that .
fred casely .
fred casely?
how could he be a burglar?
my wife knows him .
he sold us our furniture .
he gave us 10 % off .
* lord knows he ain't got the smarts *
she told me he was the burglar !
you mean he was dead when you got home?
i m covering the sheet and she's telling me some cock'n'bull story about this burglar .
and how i ought to say i did it 'cause i was sure to get off .
help me , amos . " she says , " it s my goddamn hour of need .
* now he shot off his trap *
* i can't stand that sap *
* look at him go ! * and i believed her ,
* ranting on me ! * that cheap little tramp .
* with just one more brain * so she was two timing me , huh?
* what a half wit he'd be ! * well i m through protecting her now ...
* if they string me up * i m on the garage with my butt 14 hours a day .
* well i'll know who ... * and she's up there munching on bonbons ,
and tramping around like some goddamn floozy !
thought she could pull the wool over my eyes , eh?
* that scummy ... * i wasn't born yesterday . * crummy ... dummy ... * i tell you that some things a man just can't take .
* hubby of mine . * and this time she pushed me too far .
i didn't shoot him .
boy what a sap i was !
you double crosser !
you big blabber mouth !
you promised you'd stick ...
what're you talking about?
you've been sticking me , roxanne !
stop it !
you told me it's a burglar !
the whole time you've been jazzing him .
goddamn it !
you are a disloyal husband !
look , it's true .
i shot him .
but it was self defense .
he was trying to burgle me .
from what i hear , he's been burglin 'you three times a week for the last month .
so what do you say , missus?
that's him , all right .
thank you .
your story doesn't wash , mrs. hart .
so try this on for size .
fred casely was a good time on the side , with goofy here as a meal ticket .
meal ticket?
he couldn't buy my liquor .
and fred casely could?
with a wife and five little caselys?
or did he forget to mention them .
what?
all his .
that bastard !
that bastard !
yeah , i killed him .
and i would kill him again !
once was enough , deary .
take her downtown .
come on .
here they come !
this way , honey .
oh , come on .
it s a shame to hide such a beautiful face .
why'd you shoot him?
why don't you give us a profile , with a little smile like the girl from the toothpaste ad?
enjoy it while you can .
take this down .
assistant district attorney harrison says this is a hanging case .
hanging?
i m ready to go to the jury tomorrow .
what do you mean hanging?
not so confident anymore , are you?
take her down to the cook county jail .
come on , sweetie .
headline .
what did you shoot him?
was he cruel to you?
did he beat you?
was he foolin 'around?
hey , what do you mean hanging?
morphine , opium , cocaine?
31inches ...

the keeper of the keys , the countess of the clink , the mistress of murderers 'row ...
matron mama morton !
* ask any of the chickies in my pen *
* they'll tell you i'm * * the biggest mother hen *

* always sees me through *
* when you're good to mama *

it's just not true .
* there's a lot of favors *
* i'm prepared to do *
* you do one for mama *
* she'll do one for you . *
i d be your friend if you let me .
so if there's something that upsets you or makes you unhappy in any way , don't shoot your fat ass mouth off on me 'cause i won't give a shit .
now move it out .
* they say that life is tit for tat *
* and that's the way i live *
* so , i deserve a lot of tat *
* for what i've got to give *
* don't you know that this hand *
* washes that one too *
* when you're good to mama *
* mama's good to you . *
let's go !
you must be hart .
ain't you the pretty one?
thank you , ma'am .
oh , no , call me mama .
i'm gonna take care of you .
now , you'd be happy taken down in the east block .
murderers 'row , we call it .
oh?
is that nicer?
i don't think i really belong in here .
i didn't actually do anything wrong .
no need to tell me , honey .
i never heard of a man getting killed , when he didn't get just what was coming to him .
hey , mama .
come here .
velma kelly?
you're the velma kelly?
you know i was there that night?
i was there the night that you got arrested .
yeah , you and half of chicago .
look at this , mama .
an editorial denouncing me in redbook magazine .
not in memory do we recall so fiendish and horrible a double homicide .
baby you couldn't buy that kind of publicity .
couldn't buy it?
i guess i can keep this then .
nice try .
* if you want my gravy *
* pepper my ragout *
* spice it up for mama *
* she'll get hot for you *
* when they pass that basket *
* folks contribute to *
* you put in for mama *
* she'll put out for you *
* the folks atop the ladder *
* are the ones the world adores *
* so boost me up my ladder , kid *
* and i'll boost you up yours *
* let's all stroke together *
* like the princeton crew *
* when you're strokin 'mama *
* mama's strokin 'you *
* so what's the one conclusion *
* i could bring this number to? *
* when you're good to mama *
* mama's good to you ! *
mama?
it s ... kinda ... freezing in here .
you don't think maybe there's something wrong with the heat?
not that i m complaining , but ... you know ...
if you've got a couple of extra blankets tucked away ...
lights out , ladies .

you know how people have these little habits that get you down?
like , bernie .
bernie liked to chew gum .
no , not chew .
pop .
so i came home this one day , and i m really irritated .
and i m looking for a little bit of sympathy .
and there's bernie , lying on the couch , drinking a beer and chewing .
no , not chewing .
popping !
so i said to him ,
you pop that gum one more time ...
and he did .
so i took the shotgun off the wall and
i fired two warning shots ... into his head .
* he had it coming *
* he only had himself to blame *
* if you'd have been there *
* if you'd have heard it *
* i betcha you would * * have done the same ! *
i met ezekiel young from salt lake city about two years ago .
and he told me he was single .
and we hit it off right away .
so we started living together .
he'd go to work .
he'd come home .
i d fixed him a drink .
we did dinner .
and then i found out .
single , he told me .
single my ass !
not only he was married , oh no .
he has 6 wives .
one of those mormons , you know .
so that night when he came home from work ,
i fixed him his drink , as usual .
you know some guys just can't hold their arsenic .
* he had it coming *
* he took a flower * * in its prime *
* and then he used it *
* and he abused it *
* it was a murder *
* but not a crime ! *
now i m standing in the kitchen .
carving up a chicken for dinner minding my own business .
in storms my husband wilbur in a jealous rage .
you've been screwing the milkman? " he says .
he was crazy .
and he kept on screaming , " you've been screwing the milkman !
and then he ran into my knife .
he ran into my knife 10 times .
* if you'd have been there *
* if you'd have seen it *
* i betcha you would * * have done the same ! *
what am i doing here?
they say , the famous hungarian police , that i killed my husband .
but i didn't do it .
i'm not guilty .
i can't believe that uncle sam says i'm guilty .
they say i did it , but really i ...
yeah , but did she do it?
uh uh !
not guilty !
my sister veronica and i had this double act .
and my husband charlie traveled around with us .
now for the last number in our act we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row .
1 2 3 4 5 split spread eagles
back flips flip flops ...
one right after the other .
so this one night before the show , we were down at the hotel cicero .
the three of us boozin ', havin 'a few laughs .
and we ran out of ice .
so i go out to get some .
i come back .
open the door .
and there's veronica and charlie , doing number 17 : the spread eagle !
well , i was in such a state of shock .
i completely blacked out .
i can't remember a thing .
it wasn't until later , when i was washing the blood off my hands , i even knew they were dead !
* they had it coming *
* they had it coming all along *
* i didn't do it *
* but if i'd done it *
* how could you tell me * * that i was wrong? *
* they had it coming *
* they had it coming all along *
* i didn't do it *
* but if i'd done it *
* how could you tell me * * that i was wrong? *
i loved al lipschitz more than i could possibly say .
he was a real artistic guy .
sensitive .
a painter .
but he was always trying to find himself .
he'd go out every night looking for himself and on the way ... he found ruth ,
gladys ,
rosemary , and irving .
i guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences .
he saw himself as alive .
and i saw him dead .
* the dirty bum , bum , bum , bum , bum *
* they had it comin '*
* they had it comin '* * all along *
* 'cause if they used us *
* and they abused us *
* how could you tell us * * that we were wrong? *
* he had it coming *
* he only had himself to blame . *
* if you'd have been there *
* if you'd have seen it *
* i betcha you would * * have done the same ! *
you pop that gum one more time ...
single my ass !
ten times
number 17 , the spread eagle artistic differences
* pop *
* six *
* squish *
* uh uh *
* cicero *
* lipschitz ! *

mama's gonna put you back on the vaudeville circle .
so now you're an agent too?
well deary , until ma bell installs a private line in your cell all your calls are gonna go through me .
what kind of dough are we talking about?
you know , it's a crazy world .
i mean , babe ruth is wearing rouge and playing a palace for $5, 000 a week .
yeah .
and what about someone with real talent?
well , i can talk to the boys over at william morris .
and due to your recent sensational activities , they seem to think they can get you $2, 500 . $2, 500?
geez , the most me and veronica made was $350 .
yeah , well , that's what happens when you have the right presentation .
you know what , mama?
i always wanted to play big jim colosimo's .
do you think you can get me that?
big jim's?
yeah .
geez , i don't know .
it's gonna take another phone call .
and how much is that gonna cost?
oh , come on , vel .
you know how i feel about you .
you're like family to me .
you're like one of my own .
i il do it for 50 bucks .
50 bucks for a phone call?
you must get a lot of wrong numbers , mama .
oh , miss kelly .
that's your personals .
freshly pressed by yours truly .
no , no .
it s my pleasure .
hey , listen .
can i ask you something?
you know that harrison guy?
he said that what i done is a hanging case and that he's prepared to ask for the maximum penalty .
yeah?
so?
so , i m scared .
i sure would appreciate some advice .
especially from someone i admire as much as you .
you see , since i can remember , i have wanted to be on the stage .
really?
what's your talent?
washing and drying?
no .
i dance in the chorus .

i figure i d tell them the truth .

yeah .
that's a one way ticket to the death house .
holy mother of god .
relax .
i mean , in this town , murder is a form of entertainment .
besides , in 47 years cook county ain't never hung a woman yet .
so the odds are 47 to 1 ...
that they won't hang you .
jesus , mary and joseph .
you're talking to the wrong people .
what you need , is billy flynn .
who?
billy flynn .
he's only the best criminal lawyer in all of illinois .

how do you get this billy flynn?
well , not by prayin ', dearie .
first , you give me a hundred dollars .
then i il make a phone call .
a hundred dollars?
well you just ...
i mean , it seems pretty steep for a phone call .
oh , but he's worth every cent .
he's never lost a case for a female client yet .
and with a sweet little puss like yours , well ...
let's just say justice ain't so blind in chicago .
he's never lost a case?
never .
every girl in this place would kill to have billy flynn represent her .

miss kelly , do you remember anything at all about that night?
i passed out completely , miss sunshine .
i can't remember a thing .

but my client is offering a substantial reward to anyone with information about this crime .
how much is the reward , miss kelly?
i don't know .
how much?
we'll work it out after the trial .
now , if there are no more questions , miss kelly and i have a lot of work to do .
what's all this about a reward?
awfully dumb reporters .

mama talked to you about me .
oh , yeah .

i was hoping that you might represent me .

gee .
that's a lot of money .
mama didn't say anything about $5, 000 .
lookit , mr. flynn .
i m not very good at this sort of thing , but ...
maybe we could ... make some sort of arrangement between us .
and i can be an awfully good sport .
good , you got that out of your system .
now listen , you mean just one thing to me .
you call me when you've got $5, 000 .
* all he cares about is love *

i will .
this is only a thousand .
plus this $300 i borrowed from the guys down at the garage , and there's 7 ... $700 from the building and loan fund . $2, 000
and that's all i got so far .
but i il give you $20 off my salary every week .
i il give you notes with interest .
double , triple , until every cent is paid , i promise .
when you came to me yesterday , i didn't ask if she was guilty .
i didn't ask if she was innocent .
i didn't ask if she was a drunk , or a dope fiend .
no .
all i said was , do you have $5, 000?
you said yes !
but you don't have $5, 000 !
so i figure you're a dirty liar and i don't waste my time with dirty liars .
look ...
i m real sorry , mr. flynn .
on the other hand , your devotion to your wife is really very touching .
i il take your wife's case .
and i il keep it .
because i play square .
now look , hart .
i don't like to blow my own horn .
but believe me .
if jesus christ had lived in chicago today and if he had $5, 000 and he'd come to me , things would have turned out differently .
all right , this is what we're gonna do .
by the end of the week , i m gonna have roxie's name on the front page of every newspapers in town .
sweetest little jazz killer ever to hit chicago .
that's the angle i m after .
you make an announcement , we're gonna have an auction .
tell them we gotta raise some money for the defense .
they'll buy everything she's ever touched .
everything .
your shoes , your dresses , your perfume , your underwear .
and the victrola records .
like the one i was playing when i shot the bastard .
i didn't hear that !
not that i didn't have " grounds " , mind you .
hey , what are they?
that's when we go to trial .
look , nobody's gonna care a lick what your defense is unless they care about you .
so first thing we gotta do is work up some sympathy from the press .
and they're not all pushovers like mary sunshine , but
there is one thing that they can never resist .
and that is a reformed sinner .
so tell me ,
what was your favorite subject in school?
oh , i was a real dummy .
there must be something that you were really good at .
i got high marks in courtesy and hygiene .
perfect , you wanted to be a nun .
a nun?
where were you born?
on a chicken farm outside of lubbock .
beautiful southern home , filled with every luxury and refinement .
where are your parents now?
probably on the front porch in their rocking chairs .
parents dead .
family fortune swept away .
you were educated at the sacred heart .
then you fell into a runaway marriage .
left you miserable , alone , unhappy .
and of course you got all swept up in the mad whirl of this city .
jazz , cabarets , liquor .
you were drawn like a moth to the flame .
a moth?
and now the mad whirl has ceased , and you are a butterfly , crushed on the wheel !
so which is it?
is it the moth or the butterfly?
you have sinned and you're sorry .
god , that's beautiful .
cut out god .
stay where you're better acquainted .
kid , when i m through with you , not only will you be acquitted , but every man on that jury will wanna take you home to meet his mother .
i was born on a beautiful southern convent .
what?
oh , holy shit !
oh , i m never gonna get this straight !
pipe down the swearin '.
look , from here on in , you say nothing rougher than " oh damn " .
now try it again .
i was born on ...
come on ...
you know what are some more things to do on the witness stand?
i thought i d get all teary eyed and ask for your handkerchief .
then i thought i d take a peek at the jury like this .
flashin 'a bit of thigh , heh?
what do you think?
sounds great .
hey , don't you want to hear the rest?
tomorrow , kiddo .
you're at the top of my list .
well , well , well .
sorry to be late , mr. flynn .
hope you aren't too bored .
i like it .
hey , pollyanna .
i heard your press conference is tomorrow .
yeah , what's it to you?
well , you wanted my advice , right?
well , here it is .
don't forget billy flynn's number one client is billy flynn .
meaning what?
meaning , don't let him hug the spotlight .
you're the one they pay to see .
remember , we can only sell them one idea at a time .
i can still see him coming at me with that awful look in his eyes .
and?
and we ... both reached for the gun .
that's right , you both reached for the gun .
ready?
yeah .
good day gentlemen , gentlemen , miss sunshine .
my client has just entered a plea of not guilty .
we look forward to a trial at the earliest possible date .
now are there any questions?
miss sunshine .
as you know , my paper is dry .
do you have any advice for young girls , seeking to avoid a life of jazz and drink?
absolutely yes .
mrs. hart feels that it was the tragic combination of liquor and jazz , which lead to her downfall .
next question , please .
ladies and gentlemen ,
i would just like to say how flattered i am that you all came to see me .
mrs. hart is very pleased ...
you see , i was a moth ... crushed on the wheel .
you know , a butterfly , drawn to the ...
i bet you want to know why i shot the bastard .
shut up , dummy .
mr. billy flynn in the press conference rag .
notice how his mouth never moves ... almost .
where'd you come from?
* mississippi *
and your parents?

where are they now?

move over al capone ,
the windy city has taken a new criminal to its height .
the name on everybody's lips is , roxie hart .
the sweetest little lady ever accused of murder in chicago .
women want to look like her .
fellows want to go out with her .
some little girls even want to take her home .
don't get any ideas , little lady .
on the other side of town , the assistant d. a. promises the gay little sharp shooter will swing before the year is up .
who knows?
if he lives up to his word ,
assistant d. a. harrison might become governor harrison some day .
back at the scene of the crime , everybody wants a little piece of roxie hart .
this jar of cold cream set her husband back 20 dollars !
maybe this pretty little lady will get some of that famous roxie style .
it seems everybody these days is rooting for ...
roxie hart .
take those wilted flowers over to the orphanage and make sure they know who sent them .
so , kiddo ,
given it any thought of what you wanna do after billy gets you off?
yeah , i think i d like to go on the stage .
yeah , i figured as much .
i already called the morris office .
really?
how much is that gonna cost me?
a fair deal .
10 % of all your takings .
yeah , well .
we'll see , mama .
besides , i don't even have an act yet .
killing fred casely was your act .
that's all those stiffs in the audience want .
to say they saw somebody famous .
it s a freak act .
and besides , i am better than that .
of course you are , cupcake .
i mean , you can be as big as sophie tucker .
you really think so?
bigger than kanther and juleson combined .
you know , i ve always wanted to have my name in all the papers .
before i met amos , i used to date this well to do , ugly bootlegger .
he used to take me out and show me off .
ugly guys like to do that .
once it said in the paper ,
gangland's al capelli seen at chez vito with cute blonde corinne .
that was me .
i clipped and i saved it .
you know all my life , i wanted to have my own act .
but , no ...
it's always no , they always turn me down .
one big world full of no .
and then amos came along .
safe , sweet amos .
who never says no .
i ve never done this before .
but you know , it is such a special night and you are such a great audience !
and ...
i really feel like i can talk to you , you know?
so forget what you've read in the papers .
and forget what you've heard on the radio .
because ... because i m gonna tell you the truth .
not that the truth really matters .
but i m gonna tell you anyway .
in the apartment , amos was ... zero .
i mean , when he made love to me , it goes like ...
it was like he was fixing a carburetor or something .
i love you , honey ...
anyway ,
i started foolin 'around .
then i started screwin 'around .
which is ... fooling around without dinner .
then i met fred casely .
who said that he could get me into vaudeville .
but that didn't quite work out like i planned .
i guess it didn't really work out too great for fred either .
so i gave up on the whole vaudeville idea .
'cause if you can't figure after all these years , opportunities just pass you by .
* but it ain't *
* oh no , no , no , no . * * but it ain't *
and now , with this flynn guy , with all these publicity ,
i got me a world full of yes !
* the name on everybody's lips *
* is gonna be *
* roxie *
* the lady rakin 'in the chips *
* is gonna be *
* roxie *
* i'm gonna be a celebrity *
* that means somebody * * everyone knows *
* they're gonna recognize my eyes *
* my hair , my teeth , * * my boobs , my nose *
* from just some dumb * * mechanic's wife *
* i'm gonna be *
* roxie *
* who says that * * murder's not an art? *
* and who , in case * * she doesn't hang , *
* can say she started * * with a bang? *
* roxie hart ! *
boys?
* they're gonna wait * * outside in line *
* to get to see *
* roxie *
* think of those autographs i'll sign *
* good luck to you , *
* roxie *
* and i'll appear in a lavaliere *
* that goes all the way * * down to my waist *
* here a ring , there a ring *
* everywhere a ring a ling *
* but always in the best of taste *
oooh ...
i'm a star .
and the audience loves me .
and i love them .
and they love me for loving them .
and i love them for loving me .
and we love each other .
and that's 'cause none of us got enough love in our childhoods .
and that's show biz .
kid .
* she's giving up here humdrum life *
* i'm gonna be *
* roxie . *
* she made a scandal and a start . *
* and sophie tucker * * will shit , i know *
* to see her name * * get billed below *
* roxie hart ! *
* roxie *
i just can't take it anymore .
i can't go anywhere without hearing about that dumb tomato !
oh , mama , not you too .
i have some bad news , kid .
the tour has been cancelled .
what?
your name has been out of the papers too long .
all you read about today , is that hart kid .
she's hot .
and what am i supposed to do?
suck up to her like everybody else?
it couldn't hurt .
over my dead body .
mind if i join you?
lights out , 10 minutes .
smoke?
look what some johnny sent me .
triple cream caramels , all the way from san francisco .
i m watching my figure .
you know , the trial .
hey , great mention of you in the trib 'today , huh?
there have been so many , i just can't keep track .
hey , did i ever tell you?
you're exactly same size as my sister .
i mean , you'd fit into her costumes perfectly .
really?
yeah , and i was thinking , you know , with all the publicity that's piled up between us , and when billy gets us off , we'd be a natural to do an act together .
you think so , huh?
ladies and gentlemen ,
miss velma kelly in act ... of desperation .
* my sister and i had an act * * that couldn't flop *
* my sister and i were headed * * straight for the top *
* my sister and i earned a * * thou 'a week at least *
* oh , yeah ! *
* but my sister is now , * * unfortunately , deceased *
* i know it's sad , of course *
* but a fact *
* is still a fact *
* and now all that remains *
* is the remains *
* of a perfect *
* double *
* act ! *
watch this .
now you have to imagine it with 2 people .
it's swell with 2 people .
* first i'd ... *
* then she'd ... *
* then we'd ... *
* but i can't do it alone ! *
* then she'd ... *
* then i'd ... *
* then we'd ... *
* but i can't do it alone ! *
* she'd say , * * " what's your sister like? " *
* i'd say , " men , " *
* she'd say , * * " you're the cat's meow " *
* then we'd wow the crowd again *
* when she'd go ... *
* i'd go ... *
* we'd go ... *
* then those ding dong daddies * * started to roar *
* whistled , stomped , * * stamped on the floor *
* yelling , screaming , * * begging for more . *
* and we'd say , " o. k. fellas , * * keep your socks up . *
* 'cause you ain't seen * * nothin 'yet ! " *
* but i simply cannot do it *
* alone ! *
so what do you think , huh?
come on , you can say .
i know you're right .
the first part is shit .
but the second part ...
the second part is really nifty .
* she'd go ... *
* i'd go ... *
* we'd go ... *
* and then those two bit johnnies did it a brown *
* to cheer the best * * attraction in town *
* they nearly tore the balcony down *
* and we'd say .
okay , boys ... *
* we're goin 'home , but before we go * * here's a few more partin 'shots ! " *
* and this ... *
* this we did in perfect unison . *
* now , you've seen me goin 'through it *
* it may seem there's nothin 'to it *
* but i simply cannot do it *
* alone ! *
so where's the part where you blew her brains out?
okay , roxie .
i il ...
i'll level with you ...
no , don't bother .
you think you're fooling me?
you're all washed up .
and it's me they want now , and i m a big star .
single .
oh , i almost forgot .
you were in the paper today too .
in the back .
with the obituaries .
velma kelly's trial has been postponed indefinitely .
seven words .
wow .
oh !
and here's a little piece of advice .
direct from me to you .
lay off the caramels .
and now , for all you chicago's stay up laters .
you night owls who only come alive after dark ,
chicago after midnight .
this all took place in lake shore drive?
incredible .
all right .
thanks .
they just arrested this woman for triple homicide .

yeah , get this .
she's an heiress .
and all her family is in the ... pineapples ... grapefruit , some kind of fruit , i don't know .
anyhow , this dame , kitty what's her name , something ...
she's playing house .
on the north side in an apartment , with a guy named harry .
what harry does for living , no one's quite sure .
but it doesn't really matter because she's footing all the bills .
anyhow ...
kitty comes home tonight .
harry's already in bed ,
she goes to change .
when she returns , she notices something ... rather odd .
extremely odd .
kitty disappears for a second .
cool as a cucumber .
when she returns , she gently wakes up harry .
harry says , " what?
i m alone !
she says , " alone?
you have two other women in bed with you !
so , get this , harry ... he says , " come on , darling ,
you gonna believe what you see or what i tell you?
good night , folks .

i would just like to say that my own life doesn't matter now , just that of my unborn child .
poor dear , to have your baby born in jail ...
my readers won't stand for this .
i can assure you that won't happen .
she'll come to trial at the earliest possible moment .
you can quote me on that .
i think it's sweet .
first time we ever have one where a girl's knocked up .
when is the baby due , roxie?
hey , roxie ...
roxie !
i just heard the good news !
i m the father .
hey , roxie , who's the father?

how dare you insult this ... this brave , young woman?
that's enough .
roxie , honey !
it s me , daddy !
it's daddy !
roxie , i came as soon as i could .
rox?
* if someone stood up * * in a crowd *
* and raised his voice up * * way out loud *
* and waved his arm * * and shook his leg *
* you'd notice him *
* if someone * * in the movie show *
fire * * in the second row " *
* " this whole place * * is a powder keg ! " *
* you'd notice him *
* and even without * * clucking like a hen *
* everyone gets noticed , * * now and then , *
* unless , of course , * * that personage should be *
* invisible , *
* inconsequential , *
* me ! *
* cellophane *
* mister cellophane *
* shoulda been my name *
* mister cellophane *
* 'cause you can look * * right through me *

why would they laugh?
'cause they can count .

september .
here's a copy of roxie's first statement from the d. a. 's office .
says she hadn't copulated with you for four months prior to the incident .
well , she would know .
yeah , i guess we hadn't done no copulatin 'since ...
wait a minute .
that don't figure out right .
i couldn't be the father .
well , forget about that now .
my client needs your support .
you mean she needs a meal ticket?
that's all i ve ever been .
but this time she's gone too far .
what are you gonna do?
divorce her?
you're damn right !
i il divorce her !
she probably won't even notice .
yeah .
yeah , put him through .
* a human being's made of * * more than air *

this dress makes me look like a woolworth lamp shade .
i m not wearing this .
you're wearing it because i tell you to wear it .
i m not wearing this dress .
and when andy's on the stand , i want you to do knitting .
knitting?
oh , for christ's sake .
a baby garment .
i don't know how to knit !
then learn .
that's no way to win a jury's sympathy .
oh , you don't need advice anymore?
lookit here , mr. mouthpiece .
it seems to me that i m the one who's coming up with the good ideas .
i m sick of everybody telling me what to do .
and you treat me like dirt .
you treat me like i'm some dumb , common criminal .
but you are some dumb , common criminal .
well , it's better than being a greasy , mick lawyer .
who happens to be saving your ass .
who's out for all he can steal !
maybe you'd like to appeal in court without me .
maybe i could .
have you read the morning papers?
they love me !
my zop !
they'd love you a lot more if you were hanged .
you know why?
'cause they'd sell more papers .
you're fired .
i quit .
any lawyer in this town would die to have my case .
you're a phony celebrity .
you're flash in the pan and in a couple of weeks , no one's gonna give a shit about you .
that's chicago .
no !
no !
no !
not guilty !
what happened?
it s the hunyak .
she lost her last appeal .
so what does that mean?
what that means , is that ...
next week , she's gonna ...
this is mary sunshine , coming to you from the cook county jail , where history will be made today .
katelin helinsky will become the first woman in the state of illinois to be executed .
and so ladies and gentlemen ...
and now , ladies and gentlemen , for your pleasure and your entertainment , we proudly present katelin helinsky and her famous hungarian disappearing act .
bravo !
you know , it's really not that bad .
you're clear about everything we agreed on?
yep .
i ve been up all night rehearsing .
what do you do when harrison starts coming after you?
i sit still and look straight ahead .
never at the jury .
and?
and i look modest .
and?
and ...
and say nothing .
that's right !
that was the deal , right?
right .
you ask me back , i do all the talking this time .
absolutely , billy .
whatever you say .
mr. flynn , his honor is here .
thank you .
you ready?
yeah .
billy ...
i m scared .
don't be .
i ve been around a long time .
believe me , you've got nothing to worry about .
it s all a circus .
a three ring circus .
these trials , the whole world ...
it's all a show business .
but kid , ...
you're working with a star .
* give 'em the old razzle dazzle *
* razzle dazzle 'em *
* give 'em an act with * * lots of flash in it *
* and the reaction * * will be passionate *
* give 'em the old hocus pocus *
* bead and feather 'em *
* how can they see with sequins * * in their eyes? *
* what if your hinges all are rusting? *

hello , amos .
amos?
that's right , mr. flynn .
amos .
amos , when did you file suit for divorce?
a month ago .
was there any reason for filing at this particular time?
well i il say ...
the newspapers said roxie was expecting a little stranger .
that's hardly ground for divorce , is it?
a little too much of a stranger .
by that you mean you doubted the paternity of the child .
well , sure .
tell me something , amos .
do you share a bed with your wife?
yes , sir , every night .
you expect this jury to believe that you slept next to this woman every night without exercising your rights as a husband?
i could have if i wanted to .
oh , but you didn't .
no , i did .
did what?
want to .
but you didn't .
didn't what?
what you wanted .
wait a minute , i m getting confused here .
hey , tell me hart .
you tell me .
did you ever question roxie herself?
did you even bother to ask her if you were the father of her child?
no , sir .
no .
what?
if you became convinced that you were wrong , you'd be man enough to admit it .
wouldn't you?
you'd even be willing to take her back if roxie swore that you are the father of her child ,
which she does .
she does?
she does !
no more questions !
you can step down now .
well done , andy .
roxie , i m so sorry .
* give 'em the old *
* razzle dazzle *
* razzle dazzle them *
* show 'em the first rate * * sorcerer you are *
* long as ya keep 'em * * way off balance *
* how can they spot * * ya got no talents? *
* razzle dazzle 'em *
this is the moment we've been waiting for .
roxie hart finally takes the stand in her own defense .
* and they'll make you a star ! *
order !
order !
proceed , mr. flynn .
roxie , i have here a statement in which you admit to having ... illicit relations with the deceased , fred casely .
is this statement true or false?
i m afraid that's true .
you're an honest girl , roxie .
when did you first meet fred casely?
when he sold amos and me our furniture .
and your personal relationship with him?
can you tell the jury when that began?
when i permitted him to escort me home one night ,
i don't think i would've gone with him if mr. hart and me hadn't quarreled that very morning .
quarreled?
yes , sir .
well , i suppose it was his fault .
oh , no , sir .
it was my fault .
i suppose i just couldn't stop pestering him .
pestering him?
about what?
i didn't like him working those long hours at the garage .
i wanted him home with me ... to darn his socks and iron his shirts .
i wanted a real home , and a child .
so you drifted into this illicit relationship because you were unhappy at home .
yes , i was most unhappy .
roxie hart !
the state has accused you of the murder of fred casely .
are you guilty or not guilty?
i m not guilty ...
i m not guilty !
i killed him ...
i did .
but i m not a criminal .
i m not a criminal ...
roxie ...
do you recall the night of january 14th?
could you tell the jury , in your own words , the happenings of that night .
when fred came over , i told him the good news .
and what was that?
that me and amos were gonna have a baby .
and that it was all over between us .
what happened then?
then ...
did he threaten you , roxie?
objection , your honor .
counsel is leading the witness .
sustained .
what does casely say when you told him the news?
i il kill you before i see you have another man's child !
could you tell the audience ... the jury , what happened next?
in his passion , he ... tore off my robe and he threw me on the bed .
and mr. hart's pistol was lying there between us .
and then !
and then we both reached for the gun but i got it first .
and then he came towards me with this funny look in his eyes .
he was angry and wild !
wild !
wild !
and did you think he meant to kill ya?
oh , yes , sir !
yes sir !
so it was his life or yours !
not just mine .
i closed my eyes and i shot !
in defense of your life !
to save my husband's innocent unborn child .
order !
what a bull's eye , huh?
order in this court !
roxie !
it's pandemonium here in the courtroom ...
mrs. hart's behavior throughout this ordeal has been truly extraordinary .
yeah , i bet it has ...
opening her eyes , she fans herself with her attorney's handkerchief .
handkerchief?
poor child has had no relief .
she looks around now , bewildered , seeming to want something .
oh , it's a glass of water .
oh , mama , that was my bid !
i told billy ,
i was gonna do that on my trial !
but now her eyes flutter wildly and she ...
mrs. hart has fainted again .
she flumps over , her chiffon dress up around her knees , revealing a glimpse of a blue garter with rhinestone buckle .
oh , mama , she stole my garter .
she stole my garter !
don't break my radio !
first the slob steals my publicity , then she steals my lawyer , my trial date ,
now she stole my goddamn garter .
what do you expect?
i mean these days you get a little success and it's good riddance to the people who put you here .
there ain't no justice in the world .
and there ain't nothing you can do about it .
you think i got you up here just so you can listen to my radio?
people write some pretty interesting things when they think no one's looking .
oh , mama .
state calls a rebuttal witness .
left hand on bible , raise your right hand .
you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing by the truth , so help you god?
and then some .
have a seat .
would you state your name for the record please .
velma kelly .
miss kelly , will you please tell the court if the object i m holding is the one you happened to came upon in the defendant's jail cell?
yes , it is .
i submit this as exhibit x.
roxie hart's diary .
i object !
my client has never kept a diary .
and even if she did , this would be invasion of privacy and violation of fourth amendment and illegal search without a warrant .
yeah , and she broke the lock !
order !
well , that settles that .
i il allow it .
what's the big deal?
it's just a bunch of doodlings .
if you would read for us , please , miss kelly .
i haven't worked in a while .
what a laugh , pluggin 'fred casely .
what?
the big baboon had it comin '.
i m just sorry i only got to kill him once .
i never wrote that .
you ...
hey , she made that up .
she made that up .
order !
please , mr. flynn , get control of your client .
i m sorry , you honor .
it won't happen again .
sit down and shut up .
you're making it worse .
i have no more questions .
your witness , mr. flynn .
ladies and gentlemen , a tap dance .
tell me , miss kelly , did you make a deal with mr. harrison?
maybe to drop all charges against you in exchange for testifying here today?
oh , sure .
i m not a complete idiot .
good .
since you gave such an impressive performance for mr. harrison ,
maybe you'll do me the same honor?
i d be delighted .
thank you .
here?
fred casely assured me he'd get me an audition down at the onyx .
and then he reneged on his pledge and that was my motive for attackin 'him .
the bit fat liar who welshed on a deal , so i shot him .
amos accused me of having an affair .
so i told him that the charge was ...
... erroneous .
objection , your honor .
mr. flynn is twisting this evidence to draw conclusions that are specious and ...
erroneous?
exactly .
order !
miss kelly , do you know the meaning of the word perjury?
yes , i do .
you also know that it's a crime?
yes .
for example if it turns out that you knew that this diary was a fake ,
i d hate to think of you rotting away in prison for the next 10 years especially since you just won your freedom .
look , all i know is what i was told .
oh , so ...
so you didn't find this diary in roxie's cell?
no .
mama ...
miss morton gave it to me .
she said someone had sent it to her .
someone?
any idea who this mysterious benefactor might be?
no .
she didn't know .
all right , let's see if we can work this out .
someone who writes about " reneging on pledges
and ... " erroneous charges " ...
call me crazy , doesn't that sound like a lawyer to you?
a lawyer !
a lawyer who honestly had a sample of my client's handwriting .
mr. harrison , didn't you ask roxie to write out a confession for you?
yes , but you're not suggesting that i tamper with evidence , are you?
no , let's not be ridiculous .
that's thoroughly and utterly absurd .
but now that you mention it ...
your honor , this is outrageous .
it outrageous !
i know , outrageous .
even to suggest it .
the prosecutor would make a thief's bargain with notorious velma kelly .
and then fabricate the very evidence that set her free !
just so you can win another case and move one step closer to the governor's mansion
why it'd simply be an unimaginable ...
i'll hold you in contempt .
no , it's not even conceivable .
but ... but if it were , wouldn't it be time to say ,
come clean , mr. harrison , come clean ...
even in chicago , this kind of corruption cannot stand .
will not stand !
that's enough , mr. flynn !
i agree , your honor .
this is enough !
the defense rests .
ladies and gentlemen , this is mary sunshine reporting live from the cook county courthouse .
the city of chicago has come to a complete standstill .
as the trial of the century finally draws to a close .
mrs. hart sits quietly at the defense table , hands folded , wondering what fate has in store for her?
and now a hush falls over the courtroom as the 12 men of the jury file slowly back to their seats .
gentlemen of jury , have you reached a verdict?
we have , your honor .
the jury has reached a verdict .
will the defendant please rise?
what is your verdict?
we , the jury , find the defendant ...
roxie hart is innocent !
she's innocent !
get your paper !
roxie hart is free !
she's free !
roxie ...
come on !
move it !
first she shoots the husband then she plugs the lawyer !
hey , don't you wanna take my picture?
hey , i m the famous roxie hart .
hey , what happened?
what the hell happened?
this is chicago , kid .
you can't beat fresh blood on the walls .
but my publicity , billy?
my name in the papers .
i was counting on that .
your gratitude is overwhelming , kid .
i just saved your life .
yeah , and you got $5, 000 .
and what do i get?
i get nothing?
five?
actually it's ten once i collect from velma .
i get nothing?
don't forget your blessed diary .
hope you don't mind .
i added a few erroneous phrases in there .
sorry , i couldn't tell you .
couldn't take the chance .
never lost a case .
you're a free woman , roxie hart .
and god save illinois .
roxie .
what do you want?
i want you to come home .
you said you still wanted to ... and the baby ...
baby , what baby?
oh , jesus .
what do you take me for?
there ain't no baby .
there ain't no baby?
they didn't even want my picture .
i just can't understand that .
what didn't they even want my picture?

oh , thank you .
i il put that at the top of my list right after finding a job and an apartment with a john .
just shut up and listen to me?
you really are something .
coming in here like ... some goddamn queen bee ,
all full of advice for a poor slob like me .
let me tell you something , miss velma kelly .
i got a new life now .
and one of the best things about it , is it don't include you .
fine .
i just thought we could help each other out .
wait , you thought wrong , didn't you?
look ...
listen to me .
i talked to this guy downtown .
he said one jazz girl is nothing these days , but two ...
we can make a couple o 'hundred a week .
think about it , roxie .
our faces back in the papers our names on the marquee .
velma kelly and roxie hart
shouldn't it be alphabetical?
that could work .
a couple o 'hundred?
maybe we could ask for a thou '.
we're worth it .
forget it , it'll never work .
why not?
'cause i hate you .
there's only one business in the world where that's no problem at all .
ladies and gentlemen , the chicago theatre is proud to announce a first .
the first time anywhere there's been an act of this nature .
not only one little lady , but two .
you read about them in the papers , and now here they are .
chicago's own killer dillers , those scintillating sinners ,
roxie hart and velma kelly !
* you can like * * the life you're living *
* you can live * * the life you like *
