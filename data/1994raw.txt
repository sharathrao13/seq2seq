coming . ... totalling 376 members for the popular front versus 238 ...
i'm listening to the news .
i'm on my way .
arsinoe , i have to go .
see you tonight .
i may be a little late .
not too late , i hope .
good morning .
has general dobrinsky arrived?
yes , general .
morning , sergei mikhailovitch .
morning , fyodor alexandrovitch .
you've seen the election results?
bad news for us .
it depends .
the communists are refusing to share power on stalin's orders .
remember dimitrov's speech to the 6th congress of the international?
the masses in the democracies aren't ready to rise up .
not ready to rise up .
nothing's changed .
you're sure?
i'm more than positive .
believe it or not , moscow thinks a revolution would weaken france and swing the right towards hitler .
they're no fools .
they've got their feet back on the ground , in any case .
they've put world revolution ...
on the back burner .
on the back burner .
in that case , long live stalin !
no french revolution for him .
so i needn't fear too much unrest in my factory?
trust him .
he's very well informed .
he's never made a false prediction yet .
strike action
the strike has spread to many trades and changed the face of paris .
we will fight to the last for our demands in peace and dignity !
agreed , comrades?
for our demands !
coming !
hello .
i live upstairs .
won't you come in?
the concierge gave me this by mistake .
it's for ...
mr voronin?
thank you !
yes .
she can see the pictures .
very pretty .
which market is it?
it doesn't exist .
i invented it .
i don't like painting outdoors .
i make sketches and then paint at home .
i'd never dare set up my easel in the street .
parisians are nice people but they stare and it bothers me .
so , dearie ... what's that lady doing?
she's shopping .
and this one?
she's the stallholder .
what's your name?
we call her dani .
she's feeling shy .
it's natural .
i must say she's adorable .
i hardly dare ask you ... could i paint her?
she might not feel comfortable here .
there's no school today , thursday .
could you come upstairs?
gladly .
i prefer to draw people in their usual setting .
can i say that?
we'd probably say " in their natural habitat .
are you russian?
not me .
i'm greek .
my husband's the russian .
we met in a sanatorium in greece .
he was recovering from a war wound .
now he works for the russian army veterans association .
we've been married twelve years but we have no children , much to my sorrow .
he has a son in russia , living with an uncle since his mother disappeared .
fyodor , my husband , gets letters to him but he can't visit him and sasha can't come here .
so that's my life story .
is she being good?
good as gold .
i've finished for today .
may i see?
fernande?
if you see any new carrots , please buy me a pound .
yes , ma'am .
amazing !
you have such a talent for likeness .
my memory is mainly ... visual .
come into the parlour .
i'd like to sketch her a few times in various poses and do the painting down at my place .
if you need her there , we can find a time .
no need .
i'd rather not bother you .
i have plenty of free time .
my husband , andre , and i are both schoolteachers .
he teaches history at lycee pasteur , i'm at victor duruy .
guess what i teach .
classics .
that means latin and greek .
ancient greek , though .
it's very far from modern greek .
not that far .
some words are the same .
for example , to vima .
i'm lost .
it means " tribune " or " step " .
it's the name of a prestigious newspaper .
i pronounce it bema .
now i'm lost !
who is she?
the girl from upstairs .
i met her mother today .
she's very nice .
she let me sketch her daughter .
do you like it?
guess what she does .
she teaches greek .
ancient greek?
her french pronunciation baffles me .
i understand russian better .
did you meet the husband?
he was at a meeting .
a party meeting , probably .
he's a communist .
who says?
i saw him in the street reading i'humanite .
it's my job to know everything , anyway .
is it awkward?
that he's communist?
bear it in mind .
did she ask you about me?
come to think of it , yes .
i told her you were in the white army .
shouldn't i?
i don't hide it .
he's a teacher too?
history .
intellectuals !
they're the most dangerous .
are you scared?
are you spying on them?
this is for you .
keep it .
how can we thank you?
let me use the spare sketches for another painting .
if you like .
a painting of what?
i don't know yet .
have you finished your previous one?
why not come down and see it?
now?
why not?
but i doubt it's your kind of painting .
a russian !
n. goncharova .
you know her?
but i can read russian .
this etching's by picasso .
unsigned , of course , or we couldn't afford it .
not your taste?
it's not that .
i just don't understand it .
you'll understand mine but not like them .
it's not quite finished , but still ... it's very lifelike .
this man is exactly the same as that man , there .
i always do sketches .
don't look at that old stuff .
on the other hand ... this one ... is newer .
interesting composition .
this one's older but ... i like it a lot .
delightful .
yes .
and there's this .
dani loves it .
is your art for yourself or to sell?
i've sold some to friends , but even that is hard .
i'd like to exhibit but the costs are huge .
there are more next door .
come .
the colours are beautiful .
you feel it's winter .
your paintings focus on people .
in france , landscapes are the thing .
the french don't care for genre painting .
you're right .
here's my husband .
have you met?
fyodor , our new neighbours , mr and mme passard .
my wife tells me you're teachers .
i'm a soldier .
i work for the russian veterans association .
i run their external affairs .
strangely , the russians would like this more than the french .
true .
the french don't care for everyday scenes .
and russians care even less for cerebral art .
you mean abstract art?
what about malevich , kandinsky , pevsner?
aren't they russian?
i've heard of them but they left russia .
monsieur likes cubists .
picasso , braque , juan gris ... horrible !
i don't know the others .
cubism , i don't understand and don't want to .
you sound like stalin .
i may be a white but the reds aren't all bad .
as a red myself , i'd say russia's all good except that .
for an artist or intellectual living in a bourgeois society , to shun academic art is a revolutionary act which may be superseded in an already socialist country .
your marxist dialectic doesn't sound very orthodox !
june
it's true .
it's a nice change from bolshevik art .
all those avant gardists , cubists , and other " ists " .
the soviets can't stand them !
for once , they're right .
my husband says many modern artists in france are russians , who even fought in the revolution .
our communist neighbours upstairs have a picasso .
how do you know?
did you visit?
yes .
they're very nice .
i'm painting their little girl .
here she is .
be careful .
they could spy on you .
spy on what?
every red in france and russia must have a file on fyodor .
i presume he's on his guard .
i don't know .
he doesn't seem afraid .
which one shall i take?
i love this one .
you can smell the grass !
but i prefer this one .
i painted it by the sea with fyodor .
those swimsuits are passe !
i'll take it and hang it in my salon to drum up business for you .
interesting art is hard to find since painting went over to the bolsheviks ... pardon me , to picasso and his ilk !
how much do i owe you?
i don't know ... that's far too much .
change of cabinet premier albert sarraut and his ministers present their resignation to the president .
soon after , mr leon blum is invited by president lebrun to form a new cabinet .
within hours , mr blum announces his cabinet , including , for the first time , three women .
amazing .
the reds have turned tricolour !
tricolour flag flies over republic !
homage to rouget de lisle .
see?
i was right .
the revolution's nowhere near .
we consider impossible
any policy that , given the nazi threat , could jeopardize france's security .
says who?
l'humanite .
bravo , gentlemen patriots !
and how about this?
this is no time to take power .
every strike must have its end .
bravo , comrade thorez !
uncle joe taught you well .
how do you know?
believe me .
i'm well informed .
soviet policy's shifting .
it doesn't bother us whites , but ... i wonder how our neighbours upstairs explain this u turn .
what about the strikes?
what do i think?
my party has no hand in them .
they're a gut reaction by the workers .
but do you approve?
that's beside the point .
they're a fact .
the party must take note of it .
an embarrassing fact?
like any unforeseen event , but politicians have to adapt .
i quite agree .
but as a citizen yourself , don't you have a gut reaction?
of course .
i react with surprise and expectation .
no hostility?
no true communist opposes the will of the oppressed .
still , i was quite alarmed to see trotskyists and pivertists proclaiming the french revolution .
why do you communists oppose revolution?
we oppose an abortive revolution that would surely end in repression , snuffing out the fresh hope lit by the popular front .
when trotsky says that to ally with the radicals against fascism is " criminal and idiotic " , i realize his mental faculties have dimmed .
he's the idiot , blind to the changes wrought by fascism and nazism .
we communists will link arms not only with radicals and socialists but with all democrats .
petit bourgeois , catholics ... orthodox?
and protestants , of course , muslims in the colonies ... even white russians .
even generals?
yes , now they've disarmed .
forgive me , but did you serve as a general?
in the civil war .
i was 22 .
a general at 20?
that beats napoleon .
but my career was shorter than his .
had i turned red , i might be commander in chief by now ,
like my classmate , mikhail nicolayevitch tukhachevsky .
but i'm in exile , a pen pusher despite my bombastic title .
i was , and still am , at war with the reds .
we disagree but life often throws us together .
tukhachevsky , commander in chief of the enemy army , is a old friend of mine .
my own brother served under him .
and fate has dealt you a red neighbour in france .
i won't conceal that part of my job is to prevent soviet agents from infiltrating us .
it's no secret to anyone , least of all to your party .
but nothing happens , anyway .
we no longer interest the soviets .
you know what dimitrov said last year?
to us , the white army is like a flea jumping 1, 000 miles from an elephant .
our main concern is to prevent a repeat of 6 years ago , when the soviets kidnapped ... general kutyepov , yes .
but there's no proof that the ussr ...
let's not get into that .
the fact is , kutyepov disappeared .
he was popular and determined , therefore dangerous , which i can't say of our incumbent chairman , the innocuous general dobrinsky .
july the spanish rebellion
everywhere , workers , youngsters and women join forces to quell the rebellion .
in the sierra de guadarrama , carlists and republicans fight mercilessly .
the rebels try to take madrid , attacking from north and south to strangle it into submission , but workers 'militias foil the enemy and control the key points of access to the capital .
have you spotted dani?
it's typically her , pensive among playing children .
i'll show you something .
magnificent !
i'm not sure it's very like her .
it's her exact expression .
a bit sad ... not sad , pensive .
she's a very introverted child .
you know that word?
in greek , esostrephis .
i understand .
eso , inward .
strepho , turned .
for once i understand modern greek !
it's yours if you like it .
but i'm not sure it'll fit among your picassos ... it will !
i'm delighted .
i'll put it in her bedroom .
come and see .
i thought i'd hang it here .
the colours go well with the room .
i'll pay you for it .
certainly not .
a price between friends .
it's a present .
you had to buy materials .
you can buy the frame .
let's have a drink .
... to save the spanish republic .
it's now or never .
shirking it now means war in two years .
it's sad , us leftists quarrelling over spain .
i hope your russian friends aren't for intervening ... on franco's side .
i've no idea .
i've been too wrapped up in my painting to read the papers .
hasn't your husband said anything?
him?
he's very discreet .
we seldom talk politics .
also , he's been away a lot lately .
peace rally the peace rally unites hundreds of thousands in their hatred for war and faith in peace .
premier leon blum speaks .
to desire peace is not only , on the brink of a great international crisis , to cling stiffly on in desperation to prevent mankind from rolling into an abyss !
it is something more .
it is to pose as prerequisites all the means and all the conditions of peace .
goodbye .
till thursday .
send me a postcard?
love , fyodor .
january 1937
alexei !
good to see you !
you're in paris?
yes , i work as a taxi driver .
arsinoe , meet my cousin , prince alexei trofimovitch cherepnin .
pleased to meet you .
you're not getting away without lunch .
see , i make a decent living but i'd rather be doing something more ... prestigious .
can't you take me on the white army staff?
i'm afraid not .
our association's very poor .
we live mainly on treasure we brought out of russia , but poor dobrinsky made some dire investments and we're almost broke .
cheer up !
driving a taxi is as honourable and less dull than pushing a pencil .
maybe i should follow some of my friends and join franco's army .
i advise you not to .
he wants to fight for franco .
why not?
have you gone communist?
i live in a communist country , or almost .
i'm responsible for our association .
our host government opposes the spanish nationalists , without officially helping the reds .
i know , some of our association disagree with me .
dobrinsky wanted me to second franco at salamanca .
i refused .
he gave in .
i'm gaining power over him .
they say he'll retire soon and you'll replace him .
if i do , i'll give our venerable association a thorough shake up .
in what way?
by flushing out nostalgic and revanchist sentiments .
must we abandon our motherland to its fate?
what can we do?
but don't worry , i still think communism's a utopia , bound to collapse from within .
the bolsheviks won't go until it does .
they seem to be running out of steam , or else wising up .
world revolution is off their agenda .
do you swallow what they say?
the thing is , they don't actually say it .
did you read last week's i'echo de paris?
those bogus party orders to murder all officers on the big night?
big night , " my foot !
you fell for it?
it's a fake , planted by ultra militarists and corvignolles agents .
the cagoule's military wing , to be precise .
heard of it?
you seem well informed .
who told you?
i never name my sources .
and how do you know i'm not a cagoule member?
if you were , you wouldn't say .
don't bet on it .
sometimes it's wiser to be truthful than lie , so you won't be believed .
don't you believe me?
you're right there !
i have to go .
back to work .
taxi work .
thank you very much for lunch .
see you soon .
very soon .
your cousin seems very curious .
it's normal .
he's briefing himself .
i have an exaggerated reputation for omniscience .
i like to lay the odd " red herring " , as they say .
but not with him .
he's too nice .
i pity him .
he seems happy enough .
he has dignity .
he's not cut out for exile .
he's lucky he can drive a car .
it's humiliating work for a prince but russians have a yen for humility .
not me , though .
thank god , i don't humiliate myself .
nor do i give orders , at least not openly .
i pull strings .
what strings?
i know what you mean , but how?
that ... is a trade secret .
a state secret , even .
can't you decide?
what is it?
no , nothing .
i was thinking about what i said at lunch .
your cousin wasn't all that curious .
it was you who seemed ... talkative .
i could have been shorter with him .
he's no humourist but he's a good fellow .
it's not about him .
in company , i learn things about you that you never told me .
what things?
for example , you wouldn't attend that conference in spain .
didn't i tell you?
perhaps not .
i didn't think you'd care .
i don't tell you everything .
you tell others more .
even our communist neighbours .
naturally .
whites , reds , they live for politics .
you have your art .
i care about politics too , you know !
which is why , when we speak russian , i translate for you .
thank you .
you discuss politics with me but not your politics .
i don't go in for politics .
so you have no state secrets?
some .
but as for the other ... non secrets?
you don't tell me either !
i have to learn about them second hand .
such as?
your refusal to go to spain .
i didn't think you'd be especially interested .
i said it before and i'll say it again .
excuse me , but it's not up to you to decide what interests me .
you confide more in strangers than in your own wife !
of course .
would you want me to tell you everything?
everything i can?
no , fedya .
i'm exaggerating .
but today i'll tell you something i've never said before .
it may upset you .
we've never said a word against each other before .
you know how i love you the way you are , with your qualities and foibles , which everyone has .
the one thing that bothers me about you and could slightly put me off you is the way you try to justify your ... reticence?
i think that's the word .
they're not lies , not even of omission , but ... with me , you treat state secrets the same as common knowledge .
maybe , but only because i don't mind lying to others .
to you , i mind .
you said just now you never lie .
i was joking .
in my job , called euphemistically ...
you know that word?
of course .
it's greek .
to embellish verbally " .
in my job , called euphemistically " intelligence " , not to say " espionage " , it's very hard to tell what's secret and what isn't , so i can't always be frank about harmless things , although i was frank with alexei today .
you'll say i'm being tortuous again .
i'm listening .
how can i put it more plainly?
i'm sworn to secrecy .
on some specific subjects , i don't speak so i can't lie .
but on others , where i'm not so tied , i can't help telling little fibs .
to other people , i don't mind .
but to you , i always want and always try to be completely honest .
april why close it?
let the spring air in !
not now .
i'm cold .
you've got your cardigan .
i think i've picked up a fever .
i'll take my temperature .
i think you've lost weight .
as always , in spring .
more than usual .
you should see the doctor .
i can't see much wrong with you but ... still , that fever worries me .
you should take some precautions .
what precautions?
what did the doctor say?
i'm better , but still fragile and prone to infection .
we must watch you .
did he give you a tonic?
he says ideally we'd live in the country .
somewhere sunny near paris would do .
the suburbs?
they're either lower class and grim or expensive .
come to think of it , boris has an empty house in maisons laffitte .
he wants to do it up but hasn't the time or maybe the money .
you think it's habitable?
for us?
maybe , yes .
hello , darling !
good journey?
fine .
nice conservatory !
a bit decrepit .
the glass won't fall out !
please , come in .
there are some leaks , hence the basins .
but they're only a few drops .
a place to paint ...
bedrooms are upstairs .
the shutters are closed .
we'll go up later .
here's the kitchen .
the gas and running water just need turning on .
so?
do you like it?
it's too beautiful !
it's unreal .
a fairy tale .
but i'm not sure we can accept .
do you like it?
like it?
of course , but ... no buts .
accept or we'll be upset .
you can stay for two years , three if you like .
i have plans to turn the place into a horse stud , but not right away .
so , we move out of paris .
the rent we pay now will go to you , but it's paltry .
so paltry that you needn't bother .
i'd feel embarrassed otherwise .
don't .
you're doing me a favour .
your being here is worth more to me than rent .
never leave a house empty , right?
you're well set up !
i love how you've arranged the furniture .
don't you feel cut off and bored?
people will visit us .
not everyone has a car like me .
the train station is nearby .
besides , i'm completely wrapped up in my painting .
very pretty !
i've found lots of pretty places in the country around here .
fyodor !
that's him to a t .
you see , i don't miss other people except a few good friends like you , but fedya's away too much these days .
he was seen in berlin .
when?
some time ago .
november .
i don't see ... you're sure it was berlin?
my brother in law lgor saw him .
he lives there .
yes , but did he speak to him?
he saw him through a cafe window .
it wasn't him .
he was talking to someone in the street and stopped outside the cafe .
igor recognized him .
maybe not .
fedya took a trip in november , but it was to brussels .
he even sent me a card !
brussels is on the way to berlin .
i'm sorry .
i talk too much .
i've upset you .
look , lgor could have been wrong .
fedya's entitled to go to berlin without telling me .
he's discreet about his work and that's fine .
he has to keep things quiet .
i'd rather not know .
well , he was doing nothing unusual .
that pleads in his favour .
in his favour?
what do you mean?
i didn't want to say it , but you should be prepared for certain rumours .
what rumours?
some say he's a communist sympathizer .
it's only a rumour .
absurd !
he sees reds to get information .
i know you're right .
but white russian circles are so prone to spy fever !
when fyodor's seen entering a ministry in berlin ... what ministry?
some official building with an endless german name .
but you know , it could actually help to dispel the rumours .
especially as some officers were angry that he didn't go to salamanca .
i know , but only to avoid offending the french government , which barely tolerates us .
i understand , but although boris is in industry now , he still sees old comrades who can't hold their tongues .
they say dobrinsky's retiring soon and fyodor is tipped to succeed him .
there's bound to be jealousy .
june arsinoe , have you seen my bag?
there it is .
i'm going to belgium for a few days .
like in november?
yes , to brussels .
and then?
then i'll come home .
via berlin?
who said that?
maguy , the other day .
what a gossip !
who told her?
only dobrinsky and i knew .
her brother in law saw you .
true , he lives in berlin .
he could've said hello .
you were with someone .
then you went into a ministry .
which one?
she doesn't know .
is that all?
you look upset .
it was a top secret job !
too secret to tell your little wife?
let alone others !
they already know .
not the wrong people , i hope .
i'll get boris to make his wife pipe down !
if it's not too late .
this time , don't say i'm not confiding in you .
i'll explain .
no , don't if it's a secret .
i won't tell you everything .
the association needs money .
our treasury's half gone .
some german firms helped us but now all money movements are subject to nazi state approval .
i was seeking it when i was seen , regrettably .
we mustn't appear to be close to the nazis .
that's rich !
rich?
i think not .
the left's in power here .
maguy told me something else .
you're a suspected communist spy .
now it's my turn to laugh .
call me a double agent , even a triple one !
everything i do is to support white army veterans .
it's not easy work .
having to act friendly with both sides takes cunning .
i'm a soldier .
i learned cunning in the field .
i play it like a chess game , where you have to hide your moves .
it's less noble than soldiering but not subservient .
i'm not a lackey like a taxi driver , salesman or clerk .
i don't strut on the world stage but i'm well placed behind the scenes .
i get a better view into the hearts of governments than journalists whose job it is .
like them , or even more so , i don't just observe .
i act .
indirectly , but the information i exchange with people who directly influence events can be decisive .
you think i'm delirious?
i'm not , but the thought of having all this ... power yes , my power , makes my head spin .
i have much more responsibility than dear general dobrinsky imagines .
i have to take decisions affecting the balance of power in europe and even the world !
you think i'm exaggerating?
hardly .
listen to this .
the other day , while conversing ... politely with a top official from a nearby country , i instinctively evaded a seemingly harmless question , sensing that my reply was of vital interest to his government .
what interest , i don't know , but i felt i was being manoeuvred and i balked , at the risk of endangering my mission .
i'll stop .
i've never seen you so elated .
talk , if it relieves you .
will you forgive me?
i was only half listening .
i prefer not to know too much .
i know your work is dangerous .
i fear for you , but ... i prefer not to think about it .
you could be in danger too , if you knew too much .
who'd know that i knew?
it would get around .
someone could ask you an innocent question .
you'd answer in all innocence , but unwittingly give away some less innocent detail .
who would be asking me?
anyone .
your communist friends , for instance .
they're not spies !
not as such , but they could pass the word to less naive listeners .
i shan't tell them about berlin .
i should hope not !
or that you stayed away from franco .
you can .
everybody knows .
and i'll carry on seeing them .
i want to ask jeanine to lunch on thursday .
on the train , i read an interview with maurice thorez .
we love france .
we staunchly support peace and concord .
given the events in spain , we reject
the prospect of two blocs implacably opposed to each other .
the communist party initiated the popular front
to combine the forces of the proletariat and the middle classes .
see?
it's clear .
it's the fascists who want war and strife , not us .
don't you agree?
yes , i believe you .
does your husband?
he thinks ... well , i don't know .
we don't talk politics much .
he doesn't seem to believe in the red peril .
because he thinks stalin no longer wants to export the revolution , and the french communists obey his every word .
nonsense !
that's right wing talk .
in a blindfolded world , stalin sees clearly and so do we .
we believe the revolution can wait .
the priority now is to combat fascism and we need everyone's help .
you look distracted .
do you really disagree?
sorry .
i was listening , but ... your words reminded me of something irrelevant .
go on , i'm listening .
i'm interested .
andre's overjoyed .
picasso has decorated the spanish pavilion at the world's fair with a big mural showing the german bombing of a spanish village .
he's thrilled to see a great modern artist committing himself to the fight against fascism .
the world's fair paris expo '37 gathers speed .
the german pavilion is inaugurated by dr schacht , the development minister .
i hope this exhibition , with germany's participation , will help to strengthen the ties between our peoples .
the ussr pavilion is inaugurated by mr hirschfeld , the soviet charge d'affaires , attended by mr dormoy , interior minister , mr zay , education minister , and mr chautemps , minister of state .
the spanish pavilion displays a work by the cubist artist , pablo picasso , inspired by the bombing of guernica .
moscow , june 12th .
tukhachevsky and seven generals to be executed tonight you knew marshal tukhachevsky well .
we were army cadets together but the revolution parted us .
he joined the enemy .
still , i respect him .
he's very upright , almost too uncompromising .
you think the charges were all trumped up?
of course .
such a man would never consort with the nazis .
quite the opposite .
he wasn't eliminated just for personal reasons .
i knew him as a so called hawk , eager to attack hitler before he rebuilt the german army .
so stalin's a dove?
just now , yes .
i doubt he'll start the hostilities .
are you sure?
positive .
he doesn't feel strong enough yet .
so why are the french communists so violently against pacifists such as emery and bergery?
because the views from paris and moscow are different .
stalin doesn't want war but he'd happily push others into it .
he'll help the west if the west goes first but i'll bet my boots he won't start it himself .
so why's he sending volunteers and aircraft to spain?
first , because the fascists and nazis went in first .
but second , for the italians , germans and soviets , spain isn't so much a battlefield as a training ground where you size up your opponent and you don't care who wins .
i'd even say these interventions are a sham , designed to hoodwink western opinion .
hoodwink?
why?
to hide what he's up to .
which is?
that , i wish i knew !
bravo !
you got me .
in fact , you know no more than i .
i do .
i'm telling the naked truth .
you complicate things at will .
i hope you like this .
i'm sure you'll love it .
what's it called?
exactly .
aren't you hungry?
not very .
i think i should see the doctor again .
he'll say nothing new .
i think your condition needs specialist care .
i'll make inquiries .
i don't really trust french doctors .
france is way behind in medicine .
you're not suggesting we go to america?
no , another country .
can't you guess?
not germany?
no , russia .
the ussr , if you prefer .
russian medicine is even ahead of the usa .
my son told me .
he's studying it there .
even so , how would i get to russia?
why would they take me?
i'll go with you .
they'd accept us even less .
what is this wild idea?
not so wild .
politics have changed .
not for you .
stalin's executing all the generals .
dead men need replacing .
i don't like your joking , especially about that .
i'm not joking .
would you want me to?
i'm deadly serious .
then you're crazy .
everybody is , starting with the soviets .
that's why they'll accept me .
i've been told about it .
told what?
specific things that will soon be more specific .
but even if they accept you , you won't accept them .
if there's war , you won't change sides .
yes , i will .
if there's war , i'm bound to be on france's side , which russia will join , as it can't stay neutral .
you don't think i'd fight for mr hitler , do you?
i don't like the germans .
i've never relied on them .
unlike dobrinsky , who expects them to help us .
they don't give a damn about us .
they like us as little as the soviets fear us , which is not a jot .
at a pinch , they'd have given us some sorely needed funding if we'd agreed to do them some menial favours in the spying department at its vilest level , but we refused , at least i refused .
you remember i went to berlin to see the german spymaster , heydrich?
what did i refuse to tell him?
things about my classmate tukhachevsky , whom i'd met secretly in paris on his way to the king of england's funeral .
of course he wasn't candid but his guarded remarks led me to a few conclusions .
the gestapo must have heard we met , since heydrich casually probed me about it .
i answered evasively , he bestowed a look of ice on me , and we left it at that .
we won't be seeing those funds in a hurry !
but why did mr heydrich want such information?
presumably , the germans were keen to compromise the red army chief , knowing stalin was down on him .
but i'm only guessing .
i disliked the man's arrogance .
i don't like nazis .
i don't like their grubby , grasping vulgarity .
if i have to choose sides , i won't choose the huns for anything .
i'm a russian first .
if i have to fight abroad , i'll serve only my country .
what is it , arsinushka?
are you crying?
i'm not crying .
you've no idea how happy i am .
i was so scared you were a nazi .
that was my worst fear !
have your red friends converted you?
i love you !
if i had to choose , i wouldn't hesitate either .
they haven't converted me .
but i've realized from living next to them that they're well meaning people who sincerely want peace .
sincere , i agree , but gullible .
aren't you?
aren't you gullible too?
isn't it all too good to be true?
maybe i'm gullible too , but ... i'll risk it .
in all modesty , i think i've always had a flair , a skill for sniffing out and separating true from false .
here's what i've been offered , and i think it's perfectly plausible .
i've been offered ... and not by some low ranking operative ... i have every reason to believe it comes from high authority , indeed the highest of all .
you're smiling?
you don't have to believe me .
never mind .
what is this offer?
to be reinstated in the army with my rank of general , no less !
you see?
my remark about the purges wasn't a tasteless joke .
the red army is short of experienced officers .
with none left in russia , they have to look elsewhere .
they're inviting me to run an army staff college .
if it's true , it's wonderful .
the only thing that could stop me accepting is ... yes?
yes , it's you .
i'm still dazed .
let me think .
i'm not against the offer , if it's genuine .
i hope to have proof of it soon .
but also , life in russia will upset your habits .
i haven't got any .
my habits are you .
as long as i'm with you ...
life won't be too bad .
we'll be better off than we were in paris .
wealthier , anyway .
under the soviets , it's shocking but true , there are privileged people , which will include us .
i'll have a big salary and a decent sized house on the black sea , where the climate's as mild as the riviera .
sound good?
i don't know .
giving ourselves trussed and tied to the soviets is very risky .
it scares me .
but can't you see the risks in france?
the real risk to your health and others , more nebulous but very possible?
i'm a fly in the ointment .
i'm at risk ... from soviets , nazis , all kinds of fascists and soon , i'm afraid above all , the french government .
i could be arrested , kidnapped like kutyepov , assassinated at any time .
quite frankly , i'd feel rather safer in russia .
poor tukhachevsky , rest his soul , got what he deserved .
he tried to thwart his boss and came unstuck .
it's natural .
i'll simply be an executive , serving my motherland against external threats .
bomb blasts in paris the employers federation building on rue de presbourg was partially wrecked by a time bomb .
a few hundred metres away , on rue boissiere , a similar device exploded almost simultaneously at the allied metal industries hq .
two police officers died in the blasts .
i think i can wear this on sunday evening .
it's perfect .
and for wednesday's cocktail party?
i've got nothing .
have one made .
no time .
yes !
order it on saturday , it'll be ready for wednesday .
we'd have to spend four days in paris .
would you mind?
i have shopping to do and people to see .
who'd plant those bombs except the communists?
rightist provocation?
too far fetched .
maurras says it's the government , smearing the fascists and its communist pals in one go .
too duplicitous !
it's too machiavellian .
i don't like blum but i can't see him doing a thing like that .
what do you think , general?
nothing .
i'm neither a policeman nor a prophet .
but let me say that journalists tend to put their own ideas before the facts , which often belie them .
i'm a journalist .
i know .
with candide .
jean rochereau .
pleased to meet you .
these facts .
where and how can they be found?
do you have a hunch?
none .
i'm just curious .
off the record .
i know , but as i said , i don't read the stars or coffee grounds .
my wife and i are delighted to join the party .
it hurts !
it doesn't look swollen .
does it hurt when i press?
it's deeper .
a shooting pain .
you may have pinched a nerve .
i'll get you an aspirin .
a good night's sleep will do it .
my dress isn't ready?
you said late morning .
two o'clock , then .
two o'clock is too late !
i have important phone calls to make after lunch .
let's eat now , then i'll drop you off and you can wait .
i'm sorry we're early , but ... i was in the area .
my wife has a painful foot and can't walk far alone .
we'll wait .
it will take a good hour .
no matter .
i'll make my phone calls from the local post office and be back in an hour , or rather ...
a good hour .
see you later .
so , is the dress ready?
i'm still waiting .
it's ready for fitting .
ravishing .
i'll keep it on , then .
we'll remove the threads .
the hat goes well .
how about some shoes?
i like these .
they're getting worn .
my foot still hurts .
i'd rather not change now .
at the hotel , you'll have time to rest .
the cocktail party's at 5 but i want to be there early , as i'm representing our division .
the other generals are all abroad .
won't dobrinsky be there?
no , i doubt it .
he's got a very busy day today .
the officers from brussels are here .
i'm touched .
you came specially from brussels .
we're honoured .
may we pay our respects to general dobrinsky?
i'm afraid he may not be able to come and even if he does , it won't be before 8 .
that's a pity .
we have to catch the train .
but he lives nearby .
we can call on his wife .
coming to call on mme dobrinsky?
will it take long?
we'll just look in .
the men from brussels have a train to catch .
then i'd rather stay here .
i hope i wasn't gone too long .
ready to go home?
yes , if you don't mind .
i'll come too .
my aide will see to the remaining guests .
what's up?
i think i've got myself into a mess .
when?
this afternoon .
but we were together .
what could you have done?
i shouldn't be telling you , but ... i'm afraid you might be questioned unprepared .
questioned about what?
how we spent the day .
i know very well how we spent it .
it's ages since i had a whole day out with you .
it was a marvellous day .
i don't want anything to spoil it .
unfortunately ... what is it?
i'm afraid dobrinsky's disappeared .
what do you mean?
plain disappeared .
i don't know where he is .
wasn't he at home?
no , but he was out late , anyway .
so?
i'm afraid he's been kidnapped .
who told you?
how do you know?
we didn't see him all day .
while i was at the dressmaker ... did you meet him?
where?
near here .
didn't he come?
did he come?
he was kidnapped from under your eyes?
like kutyepov?
exactly .
he got in a car which sped off .
you let it go?
i wasn't going to chase it !
but you let him get in?
you , wary and shrewd as you are?
who was in the car?
two germans .
i thought you fell out with them .
they were fake germans .
so they were russians?
soviets?
your new masters !
and poor general dobrinsky , who trusted you , fell in the trap .
me too .
i was fooled !
do you swear?
i swear .
on your son's life?
leave him out .
i refuse to swear on an innocent person .
listen !
why , if you're innocent?
on principle .
and i'm not completely innocent .
i was careless .
i'll explain .
don't bother .
it's between you and your conscience .
i'm not your confessor .
but i'll tell you this .
you say you broke off with the nazis but i'm not accepting any favours from the bolsheviks who mounted such a dirty trick .
i refuse to buy that favour with the life of the leader you ignobly betrayed !
i'd rather die here ... and watch my lungs and bones rot ...
than be cured there , at that price , if i could .
i can believe you were fooled , for all your cleverness .
i can understand but not forgive it , if you betrayed him for me .
as i said , that's between you and your conscience .
but i refuse , at any price , to profit from these crimes .
don't expect me to set foot in russia now , ever !
our dream's dead , anyway .
i have no illusions .
i'll explain .
don't bother .
tell me one thing .
while you waited for your dress , did anyone enter the room?
no , from the moment you left until you returned .
except the seamstress , who came through to fetch something or other .
but she didn't look .
i won't say you went out .
is that the idea?
but what?
i don't fully understand .
you left , saying you'd be back at once .
not at once .
you had an hour to wait .
an hour's not long .
it's ample .
i'll explain .
dobrinsky had to meet a man covertly to pick up an envelope .
he wanted me to accompany him .
as you'd be at the dressmaker's , i suggested ranelagh gardens , halfway between there and the dobrinskys '.
you didn't have to come with me .
i'd promised .
the rendezvous was set yesterday .
for such important business , i'd have understood ... it wasn't meant to be important .
i didn't mind .
no , it suited you .
it gave you a good alibi .
why should i have needed one?
believe me !
let me explain !
explain .
i won't say another word .
i took the metro .
we met at la muette station .
we walked to the gardens in barely five minutes .
on rue d'andigne , we found our contact waiting in a comfortable chauffeur driven panhard .
the german said the man with the envelope had moved the rendezvous to the bois de boulogne , three minutes 'drive away .
i couldn't show any suspicion or the deal would be off .
besides , dobrinsky had no hesitation in trusting this polite german with his aristocratic elegance , and got into the front seat .
i reached for the back door handle .
it was locked .
the german said " wait , i'll open it from inside .
by now , the driver had the engine running , but that was normal .
the german walks round the car and gets in at the back , slamming the far door shut .
as he pretends to lean over to open the near door , the car roars off down the empty street .
who had the envelope?
didn't i tell you?
the agent of a right wing anti nazi german industrialist was to leave it on a bench .
we'd arrive , he'd stand up , we'd take it and go .
all done in what , five minutes?
ten at the most .
add it up .
the metro there and back , 30 40 minutes .
the walk to the gardens , say 12 minutes plus 10 to collect the envelope , makes ... 40 plus 12 , 52 , plus 10 , 62 .
just over an hour at the most .
and the fake german?
where did he come from?
strictly speaking , he wasn't a fake .
he was ... col .
werner von nussdorf , a former military attache at the embassy , disgraced for political reasons .
he can't possibly be working for the nazis .
and what would they gain from it?
what would the russians gain?
i can't see that either .
that's why i wasn't suspicious .
do another kutyepov?
too idiotic !
it's like chess .
the stupidest moves are the hardest to beat .
anyone can lose to a beginner .
like me , remember?
but they're not beginners .
what threat could poor dobrinsky pose?
then maybe it wasn't a kidnapping .
dobrinsky wanted you out of his way and gave you the slip .
it's not his style .
it was the soviets .
but why , for god's sake?
it makes no sense .
parade him in russia , saying he retired to the soviet paradise?
he'd never say it , even under torture .
replace him with a lookalike?
create a fake general , photograph and film him?
easy !
we russians have good actors .
summon the press , hey presto !
and you laugh .
because it's grotesque !
as grotesque as the kidnapping itself .
do you think i'd lend myself to such a farrago?
it's so gross , i never imagined it possible .
any faint doubts i may have had on the way , i quickly dismissed .
i wasn't particularly wary .
no more wary than usual .
well , a tiny bit more .
i admit i made an unforgivable mistake .
i thought " whatever will be , will be .
i should never say that .
dobrinsky's been irritating me with his pro german sympathies , among other things .
i often think to myself , with shame , but still ...
to hell with him .
let him fall sick .
let him die , so we can finally be rid of him .
they're disgraceful thoughts but only thoughts .
i suppose everyone has them .
except you maybe , saint that you are .
don't you believe it .
i sometimes have thoughts that ... i had one today , coming out of the metro with dobrinsky .
crossing the street , he was almost run over .
i held him back but the thought flashed through my mind ,
that was close .
almost good riddance !
are you appalled?
i understand you .
that's not the point .
but there is no point .
i can't see any point in kidnapping dobrinsky .
my megalomania isn't all in the mind .
i was much more dangerous than him .
is it me they want to compromise?
i know things they wish i didn't .
who do i mean by " they "?
call me paranoid , but it's no underling .
it's someone very high up .
the more i consider it , the more i think this lunatic stunt must be the work of the cleverest , most highly placed , far sighted people .
it's no minor affair .
it's part of soviet global strategy and probably nazi , too .
we can't see the wood for the trees .
you mean hitler and stalin ... it's insane !
why?
what for?
your mind's been twisted by consorting with spies and plotters .
europe's two strongest leaders are old hands at plots and very twisted ones !
who is it?
tchernov .
one moment .
piotr pavlovitch , what's going on?
sorry to bother you .
gen. dobrinsky's disappeared .
disappeared?
what do you mean?
he didn't come home .
his wife called galinin , who's waiting for you at the office .
no need for your car .
i have a taxi .
very well .
i'll get dressed .
wait for me in the taxi .
are they suspicious?
no , but ... i'm his deputy .
they'd naturally tell me first .
we're sorry to get you up in the dead of night , but do you know where general dobrinsky is?
i've no idea .
i gather his wife is looking for him .
he told me he'd be very busy today .
when did he tell you that?
yesterday .
you haven't seen him today?
not today .
i haven't been to the office .
nevertheless , didn't you arrange to meet him outside?
at one o'clock?
at one , i was with my wife at her dressmaker's .
i repeat , did you arrange to meet him at 1 : 00 at la muette metro station?
what makes you think that?
this !
dobrinsky left this note on his desk .
today at one p . m .
i have an appointment with voronin
at la muette station .
we are to meet a german officer named werner ,
attached to the german embassy .
this meeting " was voronin's idea .
it may conceivably be a trap .
i am leaving this note , just in case .
do you recognize his handwriting?
i think it's a forgery .
and there's a spelling mistake here .
see?
it can't be dobrinsky .
it's clearly a forgery .
forgery or not , it will have to be shown to the police .
i agree .
i'll come with you .
vladimir petrovitch , please .
what is it?
you saw how he flinched when you said one o'clock?
keep a close eye on him .
he may be less cocky towards the police .
we'll see .
where's voronin?
he just left .
waiting downstairs , presumably .
presumably?
idiot !
why is there no light?
strange .
it was working just now .
let's use our lighters .
i'll go first .
he's not anywhere on the street .
he could be as far as the champs elysees !
see?
i was suspicious for good reason !
if you hadn't kept me back we'd have caught him !
perhaps he's gone back to the hotel .
i'll get a taxi .
fedya?
is that you?
captain tchernov .
one moment , please .
fyodor alexandrovitch?
is he back?
we're looking for him .
he went with you .
yes , to the office , but then he disappeared .
he wasn't on the stairs or the street .
so you suspect him .
otherwise he wouldn't have fled .
be careful .
he could shoot himself !
but he's done nothing !
we were together all day .
even at 1 p . m .?
i was at my dressmaker's .
we'll check .
it's the truth !
the seamstress said fyodor didn't stay in the waiting room . ... but he wasn't there .
he went out and came back a full hour later . ... a full hour later .
i even heard him come in .
i can testify to it .
no trace of voronin or dobrinsky was ever found .
arsinoe muddled up her alibis .
a czech passport in the couple's name was found in their house .
defendant , rise .
charged with complicity despite flimsy evidence , she received a heavy prison sentence . ... guilty of complicity in the kidnapping of general dobrinsky .
in prison , her bone tuberculosis grew worse .
on september 9th 1940 her left foot was amputated and she died a month later .
the startling news of a pact between nazi germany and soviet russia leaves the democracies stunned and appalled at the signatories 'duplicity .
war
defeat
evacuation
come in , please .
good morning , general .
we have arrested mr semenov , your landlord , for black marketeering .
in our search , we also discovered that he was spying for the soviets .
we found these two plans , of your offices and his apartment below .
see these marks?
they show the location of ... the microphones .
leutnant , stop working for a moment .
will you follow me downstairs?
you too , commissaire .
leutnant !
can you hear me?
yes .
say a few words to your men .
yes sir !
can you hear?
semenov confessed .
every word spoken upstairs was reported to the soviet embassy at least until the war , when our man switched to black marketeering .
his big mistake !
that explains it all .
remember the voronin case?
the spy who kidnapped gen .
dobrinsky?
you think he hid here?
most probably .
semenov was listening in and let him in to hide .
or voronin knocked on his door .
possibly .
let's check something .
come here .
see?
it cuts off the electricity in the stairs .
i see .
the lights were out when we came down to hinder our pursuit .
i'd never have suspected mr semenov .
he was very discreet .
in his business , they usually are .
when we went to report to the police , he must have run to the soviet embassy for refuge .
and from then on ... from then on , it's a big mystery but i have my pet theory .
the soviets took him to marseilles and shipped him with a group of international brigades to barcelona .
there , he was held in the ogpu detention centre where andreas nin , the anti stalin communist , was murdered .
voronin must have met the same fate .
liquidated .
a blown agent , he was no more use to anyone .
unless he was taken to moscow and killed there .
or simply in the embassy cellars .
whatever , it's a sad story .
such a brilliant man .
dead or alive , i feel sorry for him and sorrier still for his charming wife , arsinoe .
she was jailed in all innocence , i believe .
is she still in prison?
no , she died .
