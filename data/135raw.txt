this is a type 'a" alert .
this is a type 'a" alert .
for security reasons , the hotel must be evacuated .

see you tomorrow for a new adventure .
end of transmission .
that's the best show i ever did .
major dallas has the five elements on board ... and the priest is guiding them to the temple .
we're saved .
the diva said i should take care of you .
humans act so strange .
what do you mean?
everything you created ... is used to destroy .
we call it human nature .
you learn that on your screen?
i'm not finished yet .
i'm up to " v.
v " is good .
some good words in " v.
like what?
valiant .
vulnerable .
very beautiful .
oh , of course , munro !
mr. president?
now what?
we have a problem .
it's advancing?
it's not only advancing , it's moving at incredible speed .
and do you have any idea where it's heading?
korben , there's a general on the phone .
i'll give you the president .
major dallas , i first would like to salute a warrior .
you're a shining example of this army .
in the name of the federation
any idea when you'll get to the point?
a ball of fire 1 , 200 miles in diameter heading straight for earth ... and we have no idea how to stop it .
that's the problem .
how much time do we have?
if its speed remains constant , in an hour and 57 minutes .
i'll call you back in two hours .
hello?
they just landed in the desert .
good job , david .
put her in the center .
where?
here?
you got it figured out , father?
this one should be fire .
you know how this works?
theoretically .
the four stones should go around .
the fifth element should be in the middle ... and then the weapon against evil should work .
you've never seen this work?
give me that .
every weapon has a manual .
i'm sure this has one too .
that's it .
that's it .
match up the symbols .
go !
go !
wind .
my man , what you doing?
what?
what you doing?
trying to keep you in the d. j. business .
fire .
done .
what happens?
so , now , we have to open them .
and you know how to do that .
right?
theoretically ...
no .
leeloo , honey , wake up .
you have to help us .
how do you open the stones?
wind blows .
fire burns .
yes , i know all that .
but how do you open these stones?
rain ...
falls .
what does it mean?
i think that
maybe it's a charade .
a game or something .
if we don't get these stones open in five minutes , we're dead .
dead?
yes , dead .
too late .
we've lost contact with them .
three minutes .
i think mine is broken .
why i gotta get the broke one?
we're never gonna make it .
it moved .
show me what you did .
nothing .
shut up , shut up !
show me what you did , step by step .
i was standing here .
quickly .
i put my hands on the top like this , and i said ...
we're not going to make it .
and that's it?
korben , my man .
wind .
she said , " wind blows .
everyone take a stone .
water for water .
fire for fire .
earth for earth .
go !
earth .
open the other one .
korben , my man , i have no fire .
i have no matches .
do you have any?
i stopped smoking .
father , you smoke?
got some matches?
we need some fire .
we're going to die .
don't breathe .
fire .
one minute .
let's go , leeloo .
wake up .
wake up .
it's time for you to work now .
protect life ... until death .
listen to me !
listen to me .
listen , i know you're very tired .
i'll take you on vacation .
a real vacation, just you and me .
but if you don't do something right now ... we'll all die .
what's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?
it'll enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds .
you're right .
you're right .
there are some things ... very nice things worth saving ; beautiful things .
beautiful things .
like love?
yes , love .
that's good .
that's good .
that's a good example .
love is worth saving .
i don't know love .
i don't know love .
i was built to protect , not love .
so there's no use for me other than this .
you're wrong .
you're wrong .
you're wrong .
i need you .
i need you , very much .
why?
because ... because ...
tell her , korben .
tell me .
please .
why you need me?
because ...
tell me .
tell me .
because i
because i love you .
i love you .
1 0 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 , 5 ... 4 , 3 ... 2 ... 1 .

some woman .
claims to be korben's mother .
give it here .
mrs. dallas , this is the president .
on behalf of the federation
that doesn't even sound like him .
the president's an idiot .
you don't sound like an idiot .
if you don't want to talk to your mother ... just avoid me as usual .
i'll throw myself in traffic .
i'll saran wrap myself to the bed .
