puppet , sir .
only 10 piastres .
they're crap , squirrel .
they fall apart before you're out of the door .
five then , sir .
it's handmade !
please .
my sister , she's very , very sick .
i know your sister .
she's peddling in the next bar over .
do you know my mother?
no .
she's very , very sick .
i'll give you two .
that's a bad idea , you know .
like feeding pigeons .
do i know you?
my name is semelier .
i work for a private collector of rare antiquities .
i cabled you last week .
yes .
and i didn't answer .
there's been a discovery in east africa .
a christian church , circa 5 a. d.
no , it's not possible .
the byzantine empire had adopted christianity at that time ... but they never got that far south .
nevertheless , there it sits .
the british have financed a dig to uncover this church .
we believe a rare object waits inside .
we'd like you to find it and bring it back to us .
so you think i'm a thief?
now you think i'm a thief and a whore .
no .
simply a man who's lost faith ... in everything except himself .
ah .
you know nothing about me .
you're an oxford educated archaeologist ... an expert in religious icons .
you were a priest before the war .
so what happened?
this is a leather impression of the artifact we're looking for ... a representation of a mythical demon .
it's sumerian .
what makes you think it's in a church in africa?
a major granville in nairobi is in charge of the dig .
he's been persuaded to let you join it .
you're assuming that i will say yes .
you already have .
march !

mr. merrin , sir .
the major will see you now .
beautiful , aren't they?
it's a hobby from school days .
works wonders for the nerves .
you should try it sometime .
what can you tell me about the dig?
the location is a remote area of the turkana district ... called derati .
it was discovered several months ago by a detachment of my men ... on maneuvers there .
when the powers that be realized its importance , they organized a dig .
what have they learned so far?
that it's a church where no church should be .
this is father francis .
he'll be accompanying you to derati .
it's a pleasure to finally meet you , father merrin .
i've read all your work at seminary .
it's mr. merrin .
i was especially impressed with your treatise on the roman rituals .
i'm no longer a part of that .
i'm sure you didn't come here to discuss catholic rituals .
i was actually headed to kenya to begin missionary work ... when rome learned of the discovery .
they've asked me to make sure the site's religious aspect have the proper consideration .
hmm .
how come you've opened the site to the vatican?
we haven't ... officially .
you're both my guests .
tell me , have you any theories on who might have built this church?
well , not until i've seen it .
surely the vatican has some record of its creation .
i'm afraid not .
we're as in the dark about it as you are .
how long have you been with the dig , chuma?
since the beginning .
the british hired me as an interpreter .
what happened here?
plague .
ravaged the valley 50 years ago .
how many died?
all of them .
i'm lancaster merrin .
major granville should have contacted you about my joining the dig .
he did .
is something bothering you , mate?
no .
i'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible .
you drink , merrin?
i shouldn't ... but my will is weak .
then you might just survive this place .
i understand you've uncovered the church dome ... but that progress has slowed down .
you could say that .
right , doctor?
i'm sarah novak .
very nice to meet you .
lancaster ...
lancaster merrin .
you still haven't made it by my room , doctor .
i've been having this , uh , swelling in the evening .
thought you might have something i could put on it .
how about a muzzle?
so how are the interior excavations coming along?
they're not .
no?
has the structure collapsed?
no , the church is perfect ... but none of the men will enter , those we have left anyway .
why's that?
i shall be leaving for the dig in five minutes .
well ... pleasant fellow .
what's wrong with his face?
other than that it's attached to his body?
could be an allergic reaction or some kind of localized infection .
do you know why the men won't enter the church?
evil spirits .
oh .
if you believe the turkana .
and do you?
no .
i'm a doctor .
but as a priest , surely you must believe in such things .
i'm an archaeologist .
i'm not a priest .
now , that's funny .
i met father francis outside , and he told me you were .
did he?
well , he is mistaken .
father merrin .
this is emekwi .
he's donating the use of a room in his hotel for the mission school .
father , we are so glad that you are here .
these are my sons , james and joseph .
hello , james , joseph .
they are learning the bible .
we are , uh , christians .
hmm .
emekwi , can you see to mr. merrin's bags?
oh , of course .
james .
joseph .
very nice meeting you , doctor .
there's your goddamn church .
is this your first assignment , father?
before this , i was studying in the archives in the holy sea .
the vatican .
impressive .
but not really training for missionary work , is it?
this is strange .
it's 1, 500 years old .
it should be badly weathered .
it's almost as if it were buried right after it was built .
chuma .
where's jefferies?
i need to go into the church .
hyenas?
they've been here ever since we started digging .
even at daytime?
no !
no !
no !
what's the matter with him?
i don't know .
the heat?
joseph?
are you out here by yourself?
it's dangerous .
i'm collecting rocks .
i can see that .
i think you're about ready for this now .
it's a tool for professional diggers .
wow .
his seizure's stopped .
i wanted to keep him at the hospital for observation ... but the turkana have stopped trusting my medicine .
well , that must make your job very hard .
you have no idea .
thank you .
so what is it you hope to find here?
the answer to why a church was built here a thousand years before christianity arrived .
you were a priest once , weren't you?
yes , i was .
black bastards !
bloody savages !
can't wipe their own ass without instruction .
i have to get back to town .
wait .
i , uh ...
i found this ... and , uh , i want you to have it .
it's a st. joseph , for luck .
please , for my behavior .
thank you .
oi , oi !
what the hell are you doing?
get the fuck out of here , you little scab !
don't !
joseph , wait .
don't do that .
all right , merrin .
i didn't know you was a fuzzy lover .
it's okay .
come .
these little buggers , they get in everywhere .
how soon can you have the doors to the church uncovered?
a few days .
and in the meantime , how do we get in?
we don't .
chuma'll take you in through the roof .
following us , father?
is it safe to walk around?
let's see .
lucifer .
the lord's favorite angel .
cast out after the war in heaven .
can't even trust angels , can you?
you ever seen anything like it?
not this far from rome .
it's odd .
churches were built to exalt heaven ... but this , the weapons are pointing downward .
look behind you , father .
desecration of christ .
who would do something like this?
the crucifix was broken off from here .
chuma , is there an inventory of what's been found here?
i wouldn't know .
who would know?
'cause this place has been vandalized .
probably the lead archaeologist , monsieur bession .
so where can i find him?
i need to talk to him .
it's not possible .
why not?
he's gone mad .
no one's been inside bession's tent since he fell ill?
they are superstitious .
and you?
not superstitious .
smart .
chuma .
yes?
where's bession now?
a sanitorium in nairobi .
how long has he been gone?
a few weeks .
and he can read and write aramaic?
sorry?
the language spoken in palestine at the time of christ .
and what does it say?
the fallen shall rise ... in a river of blood .
do you have a moment?
of course .
can i get you some tea?
or maybe something more substantial?
yes , that would be very nice .
you dabble in the occult?
i found them here when i arrived .
i wanted to ask you , did you treat bession?
you should let me clean that before it gets infected .
there was nothing i could do for monsieur bession .
he had no medical symptoms ... nothing to suggest any kind of disease or infection .
his breakdown was purely mental and extremely severe .
that's why the turkana fear the church is cursed .
that and the disappearances .
in the past few weeks , we've lost a dozen men .
runaways?
or is it those evil spirits?
yeah .
i'm sorry .
i shouldn't have .
your curiosity's perfectly natural .
my father was a strong man .
when the nazis started rounding up the jews in our town ... he didn't hesitate .
he hid our neighbors in the crawl space .
but someone turned us in ... and we were all sent to the concentration camps .
i'm sorry .
people can't really understand , can they?
if they weren't there ... if they didn't see .
no .
and my husband turned out to be one of those people .
i met him after the war , and we came to africa together , in love .
one night i realized i ...
i had to tell him the truth ... about ... the nazis ... and what they did to me .
after that , he never touched me again .
so ... what turns a man of the cloth into an archaeologist?
i don't know .
i suppose i ...
i wanted to work with something real , something i could touch with my hands .
do you miss it?
being a priest .
no .
there's no point in that .
sometimes i think the best view of god is from hell .
i should get to bed .
i'm going to nairobi tomorrow to see bession .
talk to father gionetti .
gionetti?
he runs the sanitarium .
well , thank you ... for the medical care .
deliver us from evil ... for thine is the kingdom , the power and the glory forever .
amen .
you , priest .
what is your name?
i'm father merrin .
god is not here today , priest .
want some water?
hey , what's wrong?
it's late .
you should go back to bed .
give it to me !
it's mine !
oh , is it yours?
give it to me !
mr. merrin gave it to me .
here , take it .
take it !
oh , just give it to me , you idiot !
who you calling idiot?
take it !
it's right here .
give it to me !
it's mine .
shorty .
shorty .
shorty .
just give it to me !
all right .
okay , okay .
go back to bed , and i'll give you the stupid thing .
joseph , look out !
joseph , get papa !
get papa !
joseph , help me !
joseph , please , get papa quickly .
no !
help me !
help !
help me !
help me !
help me !
help me !
please !
what happened?
hyenas .
they tore james apart .
did you see that , lancaster?
the hyenas ignored joseph .
they were focused on his brother .
that was a lot more than focused .
they acted as if he wasn't even there .
can you see?
can you hear?
come with me .
monsieur bession?
mr. bession .
you worked on a dig in derati .
you drew a picture of an idol .
where did you see it?
was it in the church?
mr. bession .
father merrin .
how do you know my name?
i said how do you know my name?
are you hurt?
no .
i'm free .
god is not here today , priest .
i hope he finds peace .
i'm father gionetti .
i've been waiting for you .
how did he know my name?
have you drifted so far from god , merrin , that you can't see?
monsieur bession was touched by the devil .
demonic possession?
forgive me , father .
i never said he was possessed .
only touched .
so , " touched .
what does that mean?
in 1647 , the ursuline convent in loudon , france ... was plagued by possession .
thirty four nuns had been touched by the devil ... committing unspeakable acts .
having orgies including goats doesn't make them possessed .
simply horny ... and inventive .
four priests were dispatched to exorcise the demons .
three of them were possessed themselves and subsequently died .
the last one was driven insane by his brush ... with evil .
that is what happened to monsieur bession .
and that evil remains in derati .
you must be careful there .
remember , he is the father of lies .
he will seek to poison your mind .
you will need this against him .
the roman rituals .
if you need somebody to perform an exorcism , i'm not your man .
i'm not a priest anymore .
you will always be a priest , father merrin .
only your faith can save you .
well , then i'm doomed .
joseph?
what do you have there?
can i see?
you threw it away .
jefferies , what the hell are you doing in here?
it was in the dirt outside .
you threw it away .
no , i didn't .
the clasp must have come loose ...
liar !
do i repulse you that much?
maybe if you could cure my fucking face ...
i might look as good to you as that archaeologist .
joseph?
he's coming for you .
what?
he's coming for you .
what happened?
i had a bad dream .
ohh .
don't worry .
you'll be fine .
where is everybody?
sebituana's baby is coming , so the village has gathered in welcome .
oh .
joseph .
hey .
joseph .
you're back .
are you all right?
yeah , i'm just a little bit tired .
these lesions ... they're not from the shock , are they?
no .
they're completely asymptomatic .
it just doesn't make sense .
he should have recovered by now .
so what is it?
in this part of the world ... it could be a dozen things ... but his symptoms don't really match any of them .
so all i can do is just watch and wait .
i have to do some work up at the dig .
will you be all right?
hmm .
yes .
come sit with me , lancaster .
i promise i won't bite .
what is it?
how was nairobi?
oh , fine .
did you see monsieur bession?
he's dead .
how?
i don't know .
some accident .
i just don't understand everything that's happening here .
it seems like i can't help anyone anymore .
hey .
easy .
help me hold him .
emekwi .
i'm doing everything i can for him .
