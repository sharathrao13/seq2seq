they were screaming at each other for 2 hours .
nothing new .
then they heard the gun go off .
both barrels .
a crime of passion .
yeah .
just look at all the passion on that wall .
this is a done deal .
all but the paperwork .
did the kid see it?
what?
the kid .
what kind of question's that?
we'll be glad to get rid of you , somerset .
always these questions .
did the kid see it?
who gives a fuck?
he's dead .
his wife killed him .
the rest is nothing to do with us .
detective somerset?
i'm detective mills .
i get in town 20 minutes ago , they dump me here .
look ...
mills?
let's find a bar , sit and talk ...
i'd like to get to the precinct .
not much time for this transition thing .
i had a question , when we spoke on the phone .
yeah?
why here?
i don't follow .
all this effort to get transferred .
it's the first question that popped into my head .
same reasons as you , or the reasons you had before you decided to quit .
you just met me .
maybe i don't understand the question .
it's very simple .
you actually fought to get reassigned here .
i never saw it done that way .
thought i'd do some good .
be great if we didn't start out kicking each other in the balls .
you're calling the shots .
yes .
i want you to look and listen , okay?
i wasn't guarding a taco bell .
i worked homicide 5 years .
not here .
i understand .
over the next 7 days , do me a favor and remember that .
yeah .
okay .
say it again?
i thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls .
serpico's got to go .
you might want to get rid of ... this crusty .
this eye , serpico .
did you get it?
got it .
good .
coffee?
no?
nothing's been touched .
it's all like i found it .
what time was death established?
like i said ,
i didn't touch anything , but he's had his face in spaghetti for 45 minutes .
no one bothers with vital signs?
did i stutter?
he ain't breathing unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce .
that's how it's done around here?
i beg your pardon , detective , but the guy's sitting in a pile of his own piss and shit .
lf he wasn't dead , he would have stood up by now .
alright .
thank you , officer .
thank you .
i wonder ... what was the point of that conversation?
i don't know .
how many times barney five found dead bodies that weren't dead?
drop it .
phone guinness .
i think we got a record here .
better homes and gardens .
who said this was murder?
no one .
guy's heart must be the size of a canned ham .
lf this isn't a coronary , well ,
i don't know .
whoops .
how about that?
we had this case once , guy dead on the ground , knife in his back .
murder , right?
fuck .
big insurance policy involved .
guy took the tip of the blade , stuck it in his own shoulder blades .
he must have screwed up because there were ...
... multiples back there .
please be quiet .
wait a minute .
what?
we got a bucket here .
what's in it?
my god !
fucking vomit !
any blood in it?
i didn't see any .
help yourself .
are you thinking it's poison?
oh , wonderful .
very moody .
think it's poison , somerset?
you girls have got forensics waiting outside .
we might not fit .
there's room .
light's the problem .
how are you?
detective mills , go help the officers question the neighbors .
what?
and send in forensics .
he's dead .
thank you , doctor .
you saw my files , the things i've done?
nope .
i did door to doors , walked the beat , all that shit ... a long time .
and?
my badge says ...
detective " , same as yours .
look , i made a decision .
i had to consider the integrity of the crime scene , not whether you were getting enough time in the field .
hey , man ...
just don't jerk me off .
that's all i ask .
he's been dead ... a long time , and not from poison .
oh , man .
how can you let yourself go like this?
it took four orderlies just to get him on the table .
how'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
it's obvious he was a shut in .
see how big this stomach is?
strange thing is , it stretches .
look , the size of the cardiac orifice , where the food ...
i see that , but it means nothing to me .
he's got lines of distention across the duodenum .
the interior wall's ripped open .
this man ate till he burst?
no , he didn't burst all the way .
he was hemorrhaging internally .
there was a hematoma in the rectus and ...
... the abdominal muscles .
he did die by eating?
yes and no .
what about these bruises here?
i haven't figured that out yet .
gun pressed against his head?
pressed hard enough .
fuck , yeah .
on the front , flush with the muzzle .
ladies and gentlemen , we have a homicide .
killer put a bucket under him .
took his time , too .
coroner said it could've lasted 12 hours .
victim's throat was swollen , probably from the effort , and there was a point when he passed out .
that's when the killer kicked him ,
... and he burst .
sadistic fucker .
when you want somebody dead , you drive by and shoot .
you don't risk the time it takes for this , unless the act itself has meaning .
somebody had a problem with a fat boy and tortured him .
simple .
ln the grocer bags , we found two receipts .
so the killer went back ... to the supermarket .
so?
it's his thing .
i've been out in the rain .
this is a beginning .
we've got ... one dead guy , not three .
no motive .
don't start that big brain of yours ... cooking on this , alright?
i'd like to be reassigned .
whoa !
what are you talking about?
this can't be my last duty .
it'll go on and on .
you're retiring in 6 days .
you've left unfinished business before .
the cases were taken as close as possible to conclusion .
may i speak freely?
we're friends here .
it shouldn't be his first case .
i knew it .
it's not my first assignment , you dick .
it's too soon for him .
you can say that shit to my face .
captain?
it's too soon for you .
captain , can we talk in private?
this is a personal thing ...
just shut up , mills .
i don't have anyone else to put on this .
this is metro .
you don't just get to swap .
give it to me .
what?
he wants out , fuck him .
see you , have a nice time .
give it to me .
i'll put you on something else .
go on , mills , just go on .
i'm sorry , old buddy , but it looks like you're stuck cleaning up the fat man .
quiet down .
alright , calm down , calm down .
quiet down .
i'll answer questions for 10 minutes only .
ask those questions in a calm , orderly fashion , or i will leave .
detective?
can i have a moment?
no .
i won't discuss the details of this investigation , so don't bother asking .
what you got for me?
nothing yet , boss .
why don't you guys go get a coffee?
we have this breaking story .
let's go downtown , where attorney ,
eli gould , was found murdered today .
da martin talbot is taking questions from reporters .
that's ridiculous and offensive .
there is no conflict , and any claim there could be is irresponsible .
now hold on .
i just met with law enforcement officials , and they have their very best men on this .
this will be the definition of swift justice .
pardon me , george .
somerset ...
come in .
you heard the news?
nope , haven't heard .
eli gould was found murdered this morning .
someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death .
wrote the word " greed " on the floor .
greed?
yeah , in blood .
mills is heading the investigation .
excuse me .
don't do that , please?
good for him .
what will you do ... with yourself out there , somerset?
i'll work maybe on a farm .
fix my house .
don't you feel it?
don't you feel that feeling?
you won't be a cop anymore .
that's the whole idea .
i don't think you'll leave .
you can't leave all this .
guy's out walking his dog .
gets attacked .
his watch is taken , his wallet .
and while he's lying on the sidewalk , helpless , his attacker stabs him in both eyes .
this happened last night , four blocks from here .
i read about it .
i don't understand anymore .
it's the way it's always been .
maybe you're right .
you were made for this work .
you can't deny that .
maybe i'm wrong .
coroner sent this for you .
found them in the fat boy's stomach , mixed in with the food .
looks like little pieces ...
... of plastic .
set them on that desk .
they were ... fed to him .
lord .
this was found behind the fridge in the obesity murder scene .
long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to the light .
it's from milton .
paradise lost
alright ,
i'm confused .
it means that this is a beginning .
this was behind the fridge , written in grease .
there are 7 deadly sins , captain .
gluttony ,
greed , sloth , wrath , pride , lust , and envy .
seven .
hold on .
this is not even my desk .
you can expect 5 more of these .
wait a minute .
i can't get involved in this .
somerset .
he wanted it .
damn !
i'm all over it .
where to?
far away from here .
a few things to look up .
okay .
sit where you like .
how's everybody?
hiya , smiley .
george , cards are getting cold .
duty calls .
gentlemen .
i'll never understand .
all these books , a world of knowledge , and what do you do?
play poker all night .
we got culture .
we got culture coming out our asses .
how's this for culture?
you know , smiley ... you'll really miss us .
i just might .
fucking dante .
goddamn poetry writing faggot piece of shit .
fucker .
good work , officer .
thank you , lord .
oh , sorry .
i'll move in a second .
you want your chair?
no , you go ahead .
yeah?
phone .
package deal .
comes with the office .
mills .
honey .
you okay?
something wrong?
dingleberry .
i told you not to call when i'm at work .
yeah .
why?
why?
why?
okay .
it's my wife .
sorry?
she'd like to speak to you .
this is detective somerset .
yes , it's nice to talk to you too .
i appreciate the offer , but ...
ln that case , i'd be delighted .
yes , thank you very much .
bye .
honey , what ...?
well?
sorry?
what?
i'm invited to late supper at your apartment .
i accepted .
at my ... how's that?
tonight .
hello , men .
hi , loser .
hi , idiot .
that's tracy .
hello .
happy to meet you .
i've heard a lot about you .
except your first name .
it's william .
well , it's a good name .
william .
i'd like you to meet david .
david , this is william .
alright , i'll be right back .
how are the kids?
good , they're in the room .
good dogs .
good dogs .
how are you , pretty?
smells good .
what?
yeah .
i mean , thanks .
please have a seat , if you like .
would you like a drink?
no , thanks .
i'll wait .
throw that anywhere .
excuse all this mess .
we're still unpacking .
i hear you were high school sweethearts .
pretty hokey , huh?
you know something?
from the first date , i knew he was ...
... the guy i'd marry .
really?
he was the funniest guy i'd ever met .
really .
it's kind of rare nowadays .
i mean , that level ... of commitment .
don't worry .
i won't wear it to the table .
you know , no matter how often i see guns ,
i can't get used to them .
same here .
why aren't you married , william?
tracy ...
what the hell ...?
i was close once .
it just didn't happen .
it surprises me .
it really does .
well ... anyone who spends much time with me finds me disagreeable .
just ask your husband .
very true .
very , very true .
how long have you lived here?
too long .
how do you like it?
you know , takes time .
settle in , it'll be good .
you get numb after a while .
there are things to any city .
subway .
it'll go away in a minute .
real estate guy .
fucking piece of ... sorry honey .
shows us the place a few times , i think he's good .
he's efficient .
trace really likes it .
then we wonder why he only brings us here for 5 minutes .
we found out the first night .
the soothing , relaxing , ... vibrating home .
i'm sorry .
yeah , alright , laugh it up .
i don't know why you're laughing .
alright , already .
he had to get into the building before the office closed .
gould would've been working late .
i'm certain .
the biggest defense lawyer in town . lnfamous , really .
the body was found on tuesday morning .
the office was closed monday .
he could've gotten in friday ,
laid low till the cleaners left , then had his way with gould saturday , sunday , maybe monday .
look .
gould was bound , right arm free .
he was handed a butcher's knife .
check out the scale .
a pound of flesh .
one pound of flesh , no more , no less .
no cartilage , no bone , only flesh .
merchant of venice
didn't see it .
this task done , and he would go free .
that chair was ...
... soaked with sweat .
of course .
the killer wanted gould to take his time , deciding which cut to make first .
lmagine it .
there's a gun in your face .
which part of your body is expendable?
the love handle .
cut along the side of his own stomach .
let's take a fresh look .
the corpse is there , but ...
look through it .
edit out your initial shock .
the trick is to find one item , one detail ... and focus on it ... till it's an exhausted possibility .
i'll get another beer .
beer?
wine , please .
he's preaching .
punishing .
the sins were used in medieval sermons .
7 cardinal virtues , 7 deadly sins ,
... used as teaching tools .
yeah , like in ...
" the parson's tale " and dante .
you read them?
yeah .
parts .
remember in " purgatory
dante and his buddy climb up ... the hill and check out the sinners?
the 7 terraces of purgation .
yeah , right .
but there , pride comes first , not gluttony .
let's consider the books as the killer's inspiration .
the sermons were about atonement for sin .
these murders are like forced attrition .
forced what?
attrition's when you regret your sins , ...
... but not for love of god .
because of a gun in your face .
no fingerprints .
no .
totally unrelated victims .
and no witnesses .
which i don't get ... because the fucker had to get back out .
ln a major city , minding your business is a science .
ln rape prevention , they tell you never to cry for help .
always yell " fire !
nobody answers " help " .
holler " fire " , they'll come .
that's fucked up .
he must have left another puzzle piece .
thanks for talking this out , but i got to sleep .
i got to walk the dogs .
this is just to satisfy my curiosity .
i'm leaving the end of the week .
shit .
no , wait .
gould's wife was out of town .
so this means she saw something .
what if it's a threat?
i put her in a safehouse .
she wasn't happy about it .
what if it isn't what she's seen , but what she's supposed to and hasn't yet?
yeah , okay .
what?
i don't know .
but that's the one thing .
i'll sign us in .
gotta see mrs. gould .
mrs. gould?
mrs. gould , i'm sorry .
i truly am .
i don't understand .
i need you to look at each photo very carefully .
see if anything's strange , out of place , anything at all .
i don't see anything .
you're sure?
please , i can't do this right now .
okay .
it's got to be now .
maybe we missed something .
wait .
what?
here .
this painting , it's upside down .
your men didn't move this?
no .
those shots were taken before forensics .
nothing .
there's got to be something .
he moved the screws to re hang it .
what the fuck is that?
switchblade .
goddamn it .
there must be something .
he didn't paint the fucking thing .
no , he's fucking with us .
see this , this is us .
just wait a minute .
somerset's climbing furniture .
wait a minute .
you're kidding me .
call the print lab .
oh , man .
honestly ... have you ever seen anything like this?
no .
the swell pattern tells me they're not ... the victim's prints .
i say he's whacked enough .
it doesn't fit .
he doesn't want to stop .
who knows .
freaks doing their evil deeds they don't want to .
voices made me do it .
my dog made me do it .
jodie foster told me to do it .
it can take ... 3 days to make a match , so maybe you guys want to ... cross your fingers somewhere else .
you meant what you said to mrs. gould , didn't you?
about catching this guy .
yeah .
wish i still thought the way you do .
what the hell do you think we're doing?
picking up the pieces .
collecting evidence , taking pictures and samples , writing everything down , noting the times things happened .
that's all?
that's all .
putting everything into neat piles ... and filing it , on the off chance it'll be needed in a courtroom .
picking up diamonds on a desert island , saving them in case we get rescued .
bullshit .
even the most promising clues only lead to others .
so many corpses roll away , unrevenged .
don't tell me you didn't get that rush tonight .
i saw you .
we're getting somewhere .
wake up , glimmer twins .
we got a winner .
he uses the name victor .
theodore allen .
homicide found his prints at the scene .
he's got a long history of serious mental illness .
he got a very strict , southern baptist upbringing .
somewhere along the line , they fell short .
victor dabbled in drugs , armed robbery and assault .
spent time in prison for attempted rape of a minor .
his lawyer made sure that didn't last long .
by the way , the lawyer was eli gould , the " greed " victim .
we're finishing this today , ladies and germs .
victor's been out of circulation , but we have a residence for him .
you're not buying this .
doesn't seem like ...
... our guy , does it?
you tell me .
our killer seems to have more purpose .
you ever take a bullet?
never in my 34 years .
knock wood .
i've only taken my gun out three times , intending to use it .
never pulled the trigger .
not once .
you?
no , i never took a bullet , but ...
i pulled my gun once .
shot it once .
really?
it was my first one of these .
we were a secondary unit .
i was shaky going in .
i was a rookie .
we bust open a door , looking for this junkie , and he opened fire on us .
one cop got hit in the arm .
what was his name?
it spun him like a top .
well , more like slow motion .
i remember riding in that ambulance ... and well ... he died right there .
right there .
what was his fucking name?
swat goes before dicks .
they love this .
police !
clear !
good morning , sweetheart .
get up now motherfucker , now !
get up , you sack of shit !
fuck me !
dicks !
you'll want to look at this .
dicks !
jesus .
victor?
what the hell?
it's just victor .
call an ambulance .
hearse , i'd say .
call for forensics .
get your people out .
no on touches anything .
it's like a wax sculpture .
sloth .
aw , man .
goddamn .
the pictures were dated 3 days ago .
this must be the first .
look .
it's dated one year ago today .
i got a hair sample .
i got a stool sample , piss , fingernails .
he's laughing at us .
you got what you deserved .
he's alive !
cocksucker's alive !
guns down !
emergency on that ambulance !
he's playing games .
no shit .
we have to divorce our emotions .
we must focus on details .
i feed off my emotions , how's that?
are you listening to me?
yes , i can hear you .
excuse me .
what are you doing?
closed crime scene .
out !
i got a right to be here .
i'm a upl photographer .
i got a right to be here .
get out !
jesus !
fucking jerk !
i got your picture , man .
i got your picture .
detective mills , m i l l s .
fuck off .
you can spell .
fuck you .
how do they get here so quick?
the pay police for information .
they pay well .
hey , man , i'm sorry .
they piss me off .
okay .
it's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions .
one year of immobility , judging by ... muscle and spine deterioration .
blood tests show a smorgasbord of drugs in his system .
even an antibiotic , probably to prevent the bedsores from infecting .
has he tried to speak , or communicate in any way?
even if his brain were not mush , which it is , he chewed off his tongue long ago .
doc ... is there no chance he might survive?
he'd die of shock now if you shined a flashlight in his eyes .
he's had as much pain and suffering as anyone , and he still has hell to look forward to .
good night .
hello , william .
it's tracy .
tracy?
everything okay?
yeah .
yes , everything's fine .
where's david?
ln the other room , in the shower .
sorry to call you like this .
it's all right .
what can i do for you?
i need someone to talk to .
do you think you could meet me somewhere , maybe tomorrow morning?
i don't understand .
i feel stupid calling , but you're the only person i know here .
there's no on else .
lf you can , give me a call , okay?
i have to go now .
good night .
good night .
i mean , ... you know this city so well .
you've been here ... so long .
it can be a hard place .
i don't know why i asked you to come .
why don't you talk to him?
tell him how you feel .
i can't be a burden .
especially now .
i'll get used to things , you know?
i wanted to talk to someone who's lived here a long time .
upstate , it's a completely different environment .
did david tell you i teach 5th grade?
i did .
he mentioned it .
i've been going around , looking at schools , but here the conditions here are horrible .
what about private schools?
i don't know .
tell me what's really bothering you .
david and i are going to have a baby .
tracy , i ...
i don't think i'm ... the one to talk to ...
... about this .
i hate this city .
i had a relationship once .
it was like a marriage .
we got pregnant .
this was a long time ago .
i remember getting up and going to work .
a day like any other , but the first day after i knew about the pregnancy .
and i felt this fear , for the first time ever .
i remember thinking : how can i bring a child into a world like this?
how can a person grow up with all this around them?
i told her i didn't want it .
over the next few weeks ,
i wore her down .
i want to have children .
i can tell you now that ...
i know , i mean ,
i'm positive that
i made the right decision .
but not a day passes that i don't wish that i'd made a different choice .
lf you don't ... keep the baby ... if that's your decision , don't ever tell him you were pregnant .
but if you choose to have this baby , then spoil that kid , every chance you get .
that's about ... all the advice
i can give you , tracy .
i got to go .
william ,
thank you .
victor's landlord said there was cash in the mailbox , first of every month .
i never heard a single complaint from the tenant ... in apartment 306 , and nobody complained about him .
best tenant i've ever had .
a landlord's dream .
a paralyzed tenant with no tongue .
who pays the rent on time .
i'm sick of this waiting .
this is the job .
why aren't we out there?
why sit here rotting , waiting till the lunatic does it again?
lunatic " is dismissive .
don't make that mistake .
come on .
he's insane .
look .
right now he's dancing in his grandma's panties .
rubbing himself in peanut butter .
how's that?
i don't think so .
his luck will run out .
he's not depending on luck .
we walk in exactly one year after victor's tied to the bed .
one year to the day .
he wanted us to .
don't know that for sure .
oh , yes we do .
long is the way and hard that out of hell
leads up to light .
fuck him .
so what?
he's right so far .
lmagine the will to keep a man bound for a year .
to sever his hand and to use it ... to plant fingerprints .
to insert tubes into his genitals .
the guy's methodical , exacting and worst of all , patient .
he's a nutbag .
because he's got a library card doesn't make him yoda .
you got money?
i got 50 bucks .
i propose a field trip .
come on .
we'll make a list .
at the top we put " purgatory " ,
canterbury tales " anything on the 7 deadly sins .
ask yourself .
wait .
what would he study to do things he's done?
what are his interests now?
jack the ripper , for instance .
where are we going?
library .
coupons !
free coupons !
discount coupons !
they must have had about 50 health violations during the last inspection .
sit across from me .
i don't want people thinking we're dating .
give me your money .
i'll give you this , but i must know what we're doing .
somerset .
how you doing?
didn't expect a mnage trois .
it's not a problem .
sit down .
only for you do i do this .
it's a big risk .
we're just fair and square .
it's a deal .
about an hour .
yeah .
help yourself .
that was money well spent .
yeah .
alright .
telling you this , i'm trusting you more than i trust most people .
good , i'm about ready to punch you .
it's probably nothing , but it's no skin off our teeth .
the pizza parlor guy is a friend from the fbl .
who , stinky man?
for years , the fbl's been hooked into the library system .
keeping records .
assessing fines?
no , monitoring reading habits .
certain books are flagged .
books on , say , nuclear weapons ,
mein kampf " .
anyone checks out a flagged book , his library records go to the fbl .
wait .
how is this legal?
legal , illegal .
these terms don't apply .
you can't use the information directly .
it's a guide .
sounds silly , but you can't get a library card without an ld card and current phone bill .
so they run a list .
precisely .
lf you want to know who's reading
purgatory " , " paradise lost " and " helter skelter " , the fbl's computers will tell us .
it could give us a name .
of a college kid writing a term paper on 20th century crime .
at least you're out of the office .
get a haircut .
how do you know this?
i don't .
neither do you .
exactly .
divine comedy " ,
history of catholicism " , one called " murderers and madmen " .
modern homicide lnvestigation " , " ln cold blood " .
of human bondage " .
bondage?
it's not what you think .
marquis de sha day .
marquis de sade .
whatever .
writings of saint thomas aqua something .
saint thomas aquinas .
there .
he wrote about the 7 deadly sins .
ls that it?
yep .
let's try it .
jonathan doe?
whatever .
we're sure about that name?
you were , you saw it .
john doe .

let's take a look at him , talk to him .
this is crazy .
we'll just talk to him .
excuse me , sir .
are you a serial killer?
okay .
you do the talking .
put that silver tongue of yours to work .
you been talking to my wife?
retarded .
charlie's fucking angels .
a name off a computer .
mills .

he's going down .
fifth floor .
police .

clear !
mills !

where are you going?
i'm going in .
no , wait .
wait .
what?
he shot at us !
you can't go in .
we need a warrant .
we got probable cause .
come on .
think how we got here .
i can't tell about the fbl .
get out of the way .
we have no reason to be here .
listen to me .
get the fuck off me .
alright .
i'm sorry .
just pay attention a minute .
with a hole like this , we won't be able to prosecute .
the guy will walk .
that's what you want?
by the time we clear a warrant ...
fuck that !
we need a reason to knock on this door .
think about it .
okay?
okay .
you're right .
i'm all fucked up .
when you're right , you're right .
well ... no point in arguing anymore .
unless you can fix that .
you stupid son of a ...
how much money we got left?
so , i noticed this guy going out a lot , when the murders was happening , so i ...
so you called detective somerset?
right .
she called somerset .
'cause this guy ... was creepy and shit and one of the murders
... happened over there .
i told you the rest .
got everything?
i got your story .
have her sign .
you gotta sign .
good .
you did good .
i did what you said .
here .
you get something to eat .
everybody stay outside .
victor .
fuck .
somerset .
what?
we had him .
what are you saying?
fucking photographer ... on the stairs .
we had him and we let him go .
you sure this is him?
yep .
good .
get it out .
we've got nothing to go on .
no pay stubs , appointment books .
just this receipt .
keep looking .
wait , look at this .
this was under the bed .
his only source of funds?
we got his money .
i like it .
you won't believe this .
we haven't found a fingerprint .
not one .
right .
i don't believe you .
keep looking .
we could us some more men .
i'm doing my best .
what are you getting?
there are 2, 000 notebooks here .
each one has about 250 pages .
what about the killings?
we're sick , ridiculous puppets .
what gross stage we dance on .
what fun , dancing and fucking .
not a care in the world .
not knowing that we're nothing .
we are not what was intended .
wait , there's a lot more .
on the subway today , a man started a conversation .
small talk , a lonely man talking about the weather and things .
i tried to be pleasant , but my head began to hurt from his banality .
i almost didn't notice , but i suddenly threw up all over him .
he was not pleased , and i couldn't stop laughing .
no dates .
placed on the shelves in no discernable order .
his mind poured out on paper .
looks like a life's work .
with 50 men , reading 24 hour shifts ,
... it'd take 2 months .
i know .
phone?
phone?
people , quiet !
i admire you .
i don't know how you found me .
lmagine my surprise .
i respect you officers more every day .
i appreciate that , john .
i tell you ...
no , listen .
i'm readjusting my schedule in light of today's setback .
i just had to call to express my admiration .
sorry i had to hurt ... one of you , but i had no choice , did l?
accept my apology?
i'd like to say more , but that'd ruin the surprise .
got it .
everybody back to work .
you were right .
he's preaching .
these murders are his sermons to us .
look , we know him .
we know him .
who's the blonde?
looks like a 'pro '.
maybe .
she caught john doe's eye .
he collected it last night .
last night?
yeah .
this man?
yeah , john doe .
easy name to remember .
had a limp .
and the job you did for him?
i've got a picture .
one sweet piece , actually .
i thought he was a performance artist .
the sort of guy that pisses in a cup on stage and then drinks it .
performance art .
right .
i think i undercharged him .
you made this for him?
yeah , i've made ... weirder shit than that .
they found the blonde .
the picture !
the picture !
fucking pigs !
i need you to move .
i'll come out , but you guys ...
get out of the booth !
i've been in this cage the whole time .
come on , this way .
can you stop this music?
we're looking for the guy .
you from homicide?
you better ... see this .
get this thing off me !
god , get it off me !
get him out of here , now !
i want to hear it again .
tell me again .
you heard nothing strange , saw nothing strange .
no .
no?
he ask me if i was married .
i saw a gun in his hand .
where was the girl?
the what?
the prostitute .
where was she?
someone comes to your establishment ... they want to go downstairs , get some ooh la la .
whatever .
they got to come to you .
yeah .
you didn't see anyone?
with a package?
a knapsack?
something under their arm?
everybody comes in with a package under their arm .
some guys carry suitcases full of stuff .
she was just sitting on the bed .
who tied her down?
you or him?
do you like what you do?
these things you see?
no .
no , i don't .
but that's life , isn't it?
he had a gun .
and he made it happen .
he made me do it .
he put me that thing on me .
he made me wear it .
then he ... told me to fuck her .
and i did .
i fucked her .
oh , god !
oh , god !
he had a gun in my mouth .
the fucking gun was in my throat .
fuck .
oh , god .
god .
god , help me .
please , help me .
this won't have a happy ending .
it's not possible .
we catch him , i'll be happy .
lf we catch john doe and he's the devil , if he's satan himself , that might meet our expectations .
but he's not the devil .
he's just a man .
you know?
you bitch and you complain and you tell me these things .
lf you think you're preparing me for hard times , thanks but ...
but you got to be a hero .
you want to be a champion .
people don't want a champion .
they want cheeseburgers ...
play lotto and watch tv .
how did you get like this?
i want to know .
it wasn't one thing , i'll tell you that .
go on .
i don't think i can continue to live in a place ... that embraces , nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue .
you aren't different or better .
i didn't say i was .
i'm not .
hell , i sympathize .
i sympathize completely .
apathy is a solution .
it's easier to lose yourself in drugs ... than it is to cope with life .
it's easier to steal what you want than earn it .
it's easier ... to beat a child than to raise it .
love costs .
it takes work .
we're talking about mentally ill people .
we're talking about crazies .
no , we're not .
yes .
today .
no , we're talking about everyday life here .
you can't afford to be this naive .
fuck off .
you should listen to yourself .
yeah .
you say that ... the problem is people don't care .
so , i don't care about people .
nonsense .
you know why?
you care?
want to know?
damn right .
you'll make a difference .
whatever .
the point is that ... you're not quitting because you believe ... these things you say .
you want to believe them ... because you're quitting .
and you want me to agree with you and say ,
you're right , it's a fucking mess .
we should all go live in a fucking log cabin .
but i won't .
i won't say that .
i don't agree with you .
i do not .
i can't .
i'm going home .
thank you , though .
i love you .
so much .
i know .
911 , what's your emergency?
could you repeat that?
i've done it again .
what have we got?
sleeping pills .
glued to one hand .
telephoned glued to the other .
you see what he did?
he sliced her up .
then he bandaged her .
call for help and you'll live .
but you'll be disfigured .
or put yourself out of your own misery .
come on .
he cut off her nose .
to spite her face .
he did it very recently .
listen ,
i've decided to stay on till this is done .
one of two things will happen .
we'll get john doe , or he'll kill 7 and this case will never end .
don't do me any favors .
thanks , but i got it .
i'm asking to be your partner a few days more .
you'd be doing me a favor .
you knew i'd say yes .
we're here !
your wife called .
get an answer machine .
detective?
after this , i'm gone .
no big surprise .
detective !
you're looking for me .
don't fucking move .
on the floor !
stay back !
on the fucking floor !
i know you .
now , get down !
get down on your stomach .
you piece of shit .
now !
all the way !
all the way , fucker !
down !
faster .
faster , fucker .
now .
nose on the ground .
jesus christ .
what the fuck is this?
i'd like to speak to my lawyer , please .
godamnit !
he cuts the skin off his fingertips .
that's why ... we found no prints in his apartment .
he's been doing it for a while .
the bank accounts?
the guns?
so far it's a dead end .
no credit history , no employment records .
a 5 year old bank account opened with cash .
we tried tracing his furniture .
all we know about him ... is he's independently wealthy , well educated , and totally insane .
because he's john doe by choice .
when can we question him?
you don't .
he goes to court now .
no way he'd turn himself in .
it makes no sense .
there he sits .
it's not supposed to make any sense .
he's not finished .
he's pissing in our faces and we're taking it .
you know what i'm saying .
for the first time , you and i are in agreement .
he wouldn't just stop .
so what the fuck , man?
he's two murders away from completing his masterpiece .
we'll wait for his plea .
my client says there are two more bodies hidden away .
he will only take detectives mills and somerset to these bodies , only at 6 o'clock today .
why us?
he says he admires you .
part of the game .
lf they don't accept the offer , the bodies won't be found .
frankly , i'd let them rot .
we've got him .
downstairs , locked up .
he'll get ... free room and board , cable tv .
my wife doesn't even have cable !
something stinks .
and this one , you , in your $3, 000 suit , smug smile on your face , dealing for that piece of shit .
mills !
the law requires me to serve ... my clients 'interest as best i can .
we don't make deals here , mr. swarr .
my client informs you that if you don't accept , he'll plead insanity .
let him try it .
i'd like to see it .
with the extreme nature of these crimes , i'd get him off with such a plea .
i won't let this conviction slide .
lf you accept his conditions , he'll sign a confession , plead guilty right now .
it's your case .
make a decision .
full confession .
i'm in .
has to be both of you .
lf he claims insanity , this conversation is inadmissible .
blackmailing with his plea .
my client wants to remind you , two more are dead .
the press'd love to find out the police weren't concerned about finding and burying them .
lf there are two more dead .
the lab report came .
they did a quickie on doe's clothes and fingernails .
they found blood from doe's fingers , blood from the woman whose face he cut off , and a third party , as yet unidentified .
you'd be escorting an unarmed man .
let's finish it .
lf john doe's head splits open and a ufo flies out ,
i want you to expect it .
i will .
lf i accidentally shave off a nipple , would it be covered by worker's comp?
i suppose so .
lf you were man enough to file a claim ,
i'd buy you one myself .
i keep coming home late , my wife'll think something's up .
you know ...?
yeah .
what?
will this wind hurt us?
who are you , john?
who are you really?
what do you mean?
at this stage , there's no harm telling us about yourself?
doesn't matter who i am .
it means absolutely nothing .
stay on your left up here .
where are we heading?
you'll see .
we're not just picking up two more bodies , are we?
that wouldn't be shocking enough .
you've got the papers to think about , yeah?
wanting people to listen , you can't just ... tap them on the shoulder anymore .
you have to use a sledgehammer .
then you'll get their strict attention .
why are you so special that people should listen?
i'm not special .
i've never been exceptional .
this is , though .
what i'm doing .
my work .
your work , john?
yes .
i don't see anything special about it , john .
that's not true .
no , it is .
funny thing is , after all this work , in 2 months no one'll care , give a shit , or remember .
you can't see the complete act yet .
but when this is done , when it's finished , it's going to be ...
people will barely be able to comprehend .
but they won't be able to deny .
could the freak be more vague?
as far as master plans go ...
i can't wait for you to see .
it's going to be something .
know what?
i'll be standing next to you .
so when this thing happens , be sure and let me know .
i don't want to miss it .
don't worry .
you won't .
you won't miss a thing .
what's so exciting?
it's not too far now .
i tried to figure out something .
maybe you can help me?
when a person is insane , as you clearly are , do you know you're insane?
wow , it's amazing how fucking crazy i really am "?
yeah?
you guys do that?
it's more comfortable for you to label me insane .
it's very comfortable .
it's not something i'd expect you to accept .
but i did not choose .
i was chosen .
whatever .
i don't doubt that you believe that .
but it seems that you're ... overlooking a contradiction .
meaning what?
glad you asked .
lf you were chosen , by a higher power , if your hand was forced , it seems strange you'd get such enjoyment .
you enjoyed torturing those people .
that doesn't seem to fit with martyrdom , does it?
john?
i doubt i enjoyed it any more than mills would enjoy time with me in a room without windows .
lsn't that true?
how'd you like to ...
hurt me with impunity?
that hurts my feelings .
i would never .
only because there's consequences .
it's in your eyes , though .
nothing wrong with a man talking pleasure in his work .
i won't deny my own personal desire ... to turn each sin against the sinner .
wait , i thought all you did was kill innocent people .
lnnocent?
ls that supposed to be funny?
an obese man .
a disgusting man who could barely stand , who you'd point out so your friends would join you mocking him .
lf you saw him while you ate , you couldn't finish your meal .
then the lawyer .
you had to secretly thank me for that .
a man dedicated to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keep murderers and rapists ...
... on the streets .
murderers?
murderers , like yourself .
a woman so ugly inside , she couldn't go on living if she wasn't beautiful outside?
a drug dealer .
a pederast , actually .
let's not forget the disease spreading whore .
only in a world this shitty ... could you say they were innocent and keep a straight face .
but that's the point .
we see a deadly sin on every street corner , in every home , and we tolerate it .
we tolerate it because it's common .
it's trivial .
we tolerate it morning , noon and night .
well , not anymore .
i'm setting the example .
and what i've done will be puzzled over and studied and followed ... forever .
yeah .
delusions of grandeur .
you should be thanking me .
why's that , john?
because you'll be remembered after this .
realize , the only reason that i'm here now ... is that i wanted to be .
no , we would have got you .
really?
were you biding your time?
toying with me?
allowing 5 " innocent " people to die ... until you sprang your trap?
what was the evidence ... you were going to use on me ... right before i walked up and put my hands in the air?
john .
calm down .
i remember us knocking on your door .
that's right .
and i remember breaking your face .
you're alive because i didn't kill you .
okay , sit back .
i spared you .
sit back .
remember that when you look in the mirror ... for the rest of your life .
or i should say the rest of the life ...
i allow you to have .
sit back , you fucking freak !
shut your fucking mouth .
you're no messiah .
you're a t shirt , at best .
don't ask me to pity those people .
i mourn them as much as the thousands at sodom and gomorrah .
you're saying you were doing god's good work?
the lord works in mysterious ways .
see those high tension towers?
that's where we're headed .
i see it .
9 o'clock , and follow that road .
there sure as shit ain't no ambush out here .
no fucking nothing out here .
they'll come behind us in about two minutes .
i want you to go way up .
ln 30 seconds , bank east on my mark .
i'll get him out .
get out .
slowly .
stop .
stay .
what do you got?
a dead dog .
i didn't do that .
what time is it?
why?
i'd like to know .
7 : 01 .
it's close .
let's go take a look .
it's this way .
down .
down .
down .
watch him .
there he goes .
it's good we have some time to talk .
the guy in red .
keep the crosshairs on him .
a van's coming down the road .
from the north .
be ready for anything .
wait for my signal .
get out !
out !
jesus christ , man .
don't shoot .
step away .
turn around .
hands on your head .
what's going on?
why are you here?
i'm delivering a package to this guy , david .
detective ...
david mills .
get it .
slowly .
a guy paid me $500 to bring it .
he wanted it here at exactly 7 o'clock .
put it down .
we got a box .
we got a box .
call the bomb squad .
bomb squad , we got a box .
face the van .
hands up .
turn around .
okay , go .
off you go .
go .
i sent the driver out on foot .
he's headed north .
have him picked up .
i don't know .
i'm going to open it .
when i said i admired you , i meant what i said .
it's blood .
you've made yourself quite a life .
you should be very proud .
shut up , you piece of shit .
california , stay away .
stay away .
don't come in here .
whatever you hear , stay away .
john doe has the upper hand .
mills !
here he comes .
throw your gun down .
what?
i wish i could've lived like you .
shut up .
what are you saying?
do you hear me , detective?
i'm trying to tell you ... how i admire you and your pretty wife .
what?
tracy .
what did you fucking say?
it's disturbing ... how easily a member of the press can get ... information from your precinct .
what the fuck?
throw your gun down !
i visited your home this morning , after you left .
i tried to play husband .
i tried to taste the life of a simple man .
throw it away !
it didn't work out .
so ...
i took a souvenir .
her pretty head .
what's he talking about?
give me your gun .
what's going on?
put the gun down .
what was in the box?
i envy your normal life .
drop the gun .
it seems envy is my sin .
what's in the box?
give me the gun .
what's in the fucking box?
he just told you .
you lie !
you're a fucking liar !
shut up !
that's what he wants .
he wants you to shoot him .
say it's not true .
that's not true .
become vengeance .
she's all right .
become ... wrath .
she's okay .
lf you murder a suspect , you throw it all away .
he knows that .
she begged for her life .
shut up .
she begged for her life , and for the baby inside her .
he didn't know .
give me the gun , david .
lf you kill him , he will win .
oh , god !
oh , god !
we'll take care of him .
whatever he needs .
where are you going to be?
around .
i'll be around .
the world is a fine place , and worth fighting for " .
i agree about the second part .
