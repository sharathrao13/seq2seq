i worked with him over at the george .
eddie , let me ask you a question .
was my brother into something?
richie?
no , man .
he wasn't that type of guy .
i'm very sorry about your father .
don't feel sorry for me .
you don't know me .
you're a picture on a piano .
hold up a second , would you?
i couldn't help noticing you .
you stand out in a crowd .
i'm jack , richie's brother .
i'm real sorry .
he was a great guy .
yeah .
so , where'd you know richard from?
around the bar .
you know how it goes .
no .
why don't you tell me?
how does it go?
i don't know you well enough to get personal .
you think something could've happened ... ... between the last time you saw him and the accident?
i don't know , man .
maybe , i guess .
but you'd know if something was up , right?
shit , man , i don't know .
i guess .
yeah , maybe .
jack , that is enough !
it's enough .
what are you gonna do , rough me up?
i'd like to be alone .
sure .
i'm fine , all right?
i just came out for a smoke .
you know , doreen , you don't know me very well and what you do know ... ... you don't seem to like very much .
i'm gonna be here over the weekend , so , if you need anything , anything at all ... ... i'll be staying at the mercer hotel , okay?
he didn't drink , you know .
what?
my dad .
he wouldn't drink and drive .
so what do you think happened?
i don't know .
maybe ....
i don't know .
forget it .
he's dead , right?
what's it matter?
tell my mom i'll be home later .
what'd i tell you?
what'd i say?
which part of " i can't let you go " did you not under fucking stand?
jack , this is your job .
this is not a fucking charity case .
you do your job !
i want your butt down here tomorrow .
i am the boss , jack !
okay?
got me?
i can't believe you guys kept this cat .
richie and i used to hide stuff from our mom underneath all the cookies .
i'm pretty sure she knew , but i don't think she really cared .
so were you two guys okay?
what?
i mean you and richie?
i mean , before the accident , were you two getting along okay?
what kind of question is that?
it's just a question .
was he drinking a lot more?
more than normal?
what?
jack ....
it's just that eddie said he didn't see him drink much .
doreen said he wouldn't drink and drive .
i'm just wondering if
what are you doing?
what?
why do you care all of a sudden?
because he's dead?
where were you when he was alive?
he was your brother .
you disappeared on him , and now he's gone .
so what am i supposed to do?
take a trip down memory lane with you?
catch you up on how he's doing?
what do you think you're gonna do , come here and fix things?
you don't fix things , jack .
you break things .
remember?
hello , it's connie .
it's me .
what do you say?
fucking white of you to call .
fletcher just ripped me a new asshole .
you're on your way back?
i'm staying a little while .
come on , look .
who do you think is taking the heat for you?
we're partners .
if you're screwed , i'm screwed .
he wants you here .
you need a written invitation?
i got some things to do .
okay , here's the truth as i know it .
i don't know how much longer i can cover your ass .
are we gonna see fletcher?
absolutely .
we are flying in .
we are there .
you got something to say?
what do you wanna say?
it's time to sit down and chop it up with the big dog .
because i'm hearing talk , jack .
people are talking .
about you .
and audrey .
i don't know if i can keep it from him .
they must be hearing it from you .
am i right?
you simple bitch !
i'm covering your ass .
do you hear me?
i'm covering your ass !
you better cover your own ass .
which way is brumby's office?
no , you listen .
i don't want to hear you can't find it .
this was supposed to be done .
a guy died the other night .
can you hold on a second?
can i help you with something?
i'm jack carter , richie's brother .
i'll call you right back .
christ .
i'm sorry i wasn't at the funeral .
never could take them .
would you like some coffee or something?
no , i'm fine , thanks .
he was a good bloke , richie was .
saved my ass a lot of money just by doing a solid job .
so how long was he running this place for you?
since we've been up .
about five years .
five years and no problems?
none .
no enemies?
well , not that i know of .
i mean , he was an easy going sort of bloke .
does he seem like a guy that would get dead drunk ... ... and go out driving in a rain storm?
not to me .
me neither .
where is this going?
i think he was taken out .
taken out?
richie?
why would you say that?
there's something you're not telling me .
what the bloody hell does that mean?
relax .
i don't like hard cases coming in here and talking to me like i know something .
if there's someone putting out something about me then i want to know who it is .
when i know what it is and who's been saying it ... ... l might just take the matter up with you , jack .
mightn't l?
you're a big man , but you're out of shape .
with me , it's a full time job , so please , sit down .
thank you .
now , i know that you have security cameras around the bar .
did the police ask to look at the tapes?
why would they?
it was drunk driving .
do you mind if i do?
that's got the whole night on it .
did you talk to geraldine?
who's geraldine?
oh , christ .
how am i gonna put this?
she was his lady on the side , his inamorata .
you know this for sure?
what can i tell you?
it wasn't a big thing .
not many people knew about it .
cyrus .
how are you doing?
holy shit .
well , if it ain't the vegas man with the vegas tan .
geraldine , right?
been a long time .
yeah , jack , it's been a very long time .
i heard about richie , man .
that's pretty messed up .
yeah .
you got my deepest condolences and all that shit .
i appreciate that .
you're still running with fletcher?
why not?
how are you making a living?
well , i'm making .
with who?
with somebody .
what do you care?
i don't care .
i just want to know if you're still a bottom feeder .
let me tell you something , jack .
you see all this shit here?
you see it?
this is the new world , brother .
i'm on line .
these are my girls .
my business .
while you're running around chasing deadbeats for some fucking asshole ... ... i'm swimming in the big pool , baby .
i got the juice around here , now .
i hooked up with this freak and this foreign guy .
created my own little empire .
look at you .
the little man first to start up .
you got a problem with me?
let me tell you something , jack .
i think you should take a big moment ... ... and just think about where you are .
because this ain't yesterday , slick .
relax , i'm just playing with you a little bit .
yeah , i get that .
don't put your hands on me .
come on , let me see your eyes .
come on .
whatever turns you on , jack .
still pretty?
like cat piss in the snow .
see you around .
hey , you can't come in here .
hey , mate , where are you going?
is this the part where i'm supposed to be scared?
you carter?
that's right .
and you really don't want to know me .
shit , it's good to be home .
damn you , cyrus , i never met the guy .
get off .
i don't know him , okay?
shut up and get in the car .
good afternoon .
are you a member?
i'm here with mr. franklin .
go right ahead .
pal , you're walking on my line .
just smile , sweetheart , and get rid of the guy , okay?
nice stroke .
who the fuck are you?
tiger woods .
i'm gonna go and get security , all right?
can i help you , sir?
i don't know .
are you from the club?
is there a problem?
my brother died the other night , and now i'm here .
listen , mr ....
carter .
carter .
mr. carter .
i'm real sorry about your brother .
that sucks .
but i can't help you here .
i suggest you contact my outreach program over at the offices
mind if we talk a minute?
yes , i mind .
i was under the impression this was a private club .
i think we should go some place and talk .
listen , scary man  i scare you?
whatever this is , it isn't going over real well .
drive me back to my car .
we'll talk on the way .
is that a problem?
it is a problem .
no , it's a problem if you don't .
come on .
it's okay .
so , what's your name?
jeremy kinnear .
maybe you've read about me in forbes .
i don't do that , jeremy .
what are you telling me?
you're bucks up?
without blowing the proverbial horn ... ... my computer company is worth about a gazillion dollars .
give or take .
your folks must be very proud .
i paid off my student loans , bought them a house in france .
they leave me alone .
i think we've got a mutual acquaintance , jeremy .
really?
yeah .
cyrus paice .
yeah , i know him .
i try not to spend too much time around him , though .
what's the connection?
you know , mr. carter , i really don't have to answer your questions .
sure you do , jeremy .
what's the connection?
okay , mr. carter , fine .
when you spend most of your life stuck behind a computer ... ... things like golf and girls become pretty important .
they don't go well with the glasses ... ... and pocket protector image my stockholders prefer .
so  so , he pulls for you .
you know why i like golf , mr. carter?
'cause the ball just keeps going away .
only sport where you hit that little sucker and it doesn't come back at you .
i've got to want to go after it and get it .
and when i get to it ... ... l just knock it away again .
see what i'm saying , mr. carter?
once i get rid of it ... ... l never want to see it again .
he said his brother died the other night and now he's here .
he's here !
you get me?
we are fucked !
excuse me , mr. kinnear .
can you get your feet off the table?
yes .
no , you listen to me .
you asked me to get you on line , i did that .
fair trade .
then you start this porn thing .
i said , " keep me clean , " you can't even do that .
i don't want to think what happens if he's taken that thing to the police .
how'd he get it , anyway?
it was supposed to go straight to the hard drive .
damn right i'm freaking out !
i'm a harvard grad .
i do not do porn .
no , shush !
i don't want to know what happened the other night .
i don't care .
it's none of my business .
i just want the big brother gone .
i don't mean " gone " like you " goned " the other guy .
i mean away .
i want him away , i want you away .
i want the whole thing done .
where's the big bad wolf?
out with the pigs , i guess .
he wants you to come back and
i was thinking that , when i get back , you and me ... ... we gotta get out of vegas for good , you know?
jack , i can't do this .
do what?
you and me .
les fletcher is my job , it's what i do .
you ... ... you're ... ... you're something different .
all right , fine .
you ought to get out of there , with or without me ... ... but you gotta get out .
audrey !
i'm up here !
get your ass down here .
i gotta go .
yeah , it's good .
another time , another place?
yeah .
'bye .
sometimes i feel i'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life .
i wake up in the morning , i look over at my little girl ... ... and i wonder when it was we became strangers .
she's all i have now , jack , and i want her back so bad ... ... and i don't even know where she went .
she won't talk to me .
she won't even yell at me .
oh , my god .
who are you?
what?
i mean , i'm just trying to make sense of this .
of you .
you disappear off the face of the earth for five years ... ... then you come back .
i don't know , you look like frank sinatra or something and ....
i just can't figure you out .
you know , it's not that big a deal , gloria .
everything changes , they say .
why not me?
you want to try to do something right .
once .
yeah , well , what is that , though?
what's right , jack , you know?
you're too late to be richie's brother .
you can't be doreen's father .
and you can't be my man .
so , i just don't know where you fit .
maybe i don't .
maybe i don't .
i'm sorry .
eddie !
you know geraldine?
what?
geraldine .
do you know where she lives?
i don't know , man .
the girl that hung around with richie .
do you know where she lives?
a girl?
what?
come on .
so , you know doreen much?
yeah , a little .
it's right up here on the left .
so , you done with me , man?
no .
sit tight , i'll be right back .
relax , everything is okay .
how are you doing?
i'm looking for geraldine .
do you know where she is?
what was richie to you?
you can't just break into my house .
what was he to you?
i told you .
i met him at the bar .
he was just a guy i met .
that's all .
that's all?
he was nicer than most .
did you know he was married?
no .
did you know that?
what do you want?
i talked to him .
it's not a crime .
i gotta be somewhere .
i want to know what happened .
you don't want to know .
look at me .
look at me .
i didn't come up here to hurt you .
i just wanna know what happened .
richie wanted me to leave with him .
he and his wife weren't getting along so well .
hardly spoke , you know?
they were gonna get divorced .
he wanted me to run away someplace like new york or something .
i said i couldn't do that .
i got my own life here .
yeah .
so , i went to the bar to say goodbye and he followed me out .
and he makes this big scene outside the bar .
i hear he got pretty drunk .
look , i don't want to talk about this anymore .
the keys are in it .
looks like the rain must have backed up the sewer .
how you been , man?
still hanging around here , thorpey?
i like it here .
i got to have a word with you , all right?
confidential .
you just stay in the car .
i'll listen .
what do you want to tell me?
how you been , man?
i mean , you look good .
thank you .
i'm losing sleep here , so what do you want?
here , take this .
it's free .
alaska airlines , first class .
that's nice .
and who do i have to thank?
i've been asked to make sure you get on that plane .
tonight .
whatever they're paying you , it won't be enough .
what the fuck is going on?
what you wanna do , cowboy?
you wanna get rough?
come on .
take your best shot .
come on , shoot .
you got the stuff?
you got the balls?
you got the guts , do it .
put the gun down .
there's no dishonor in avoiding confrontation .
in dealing with an armed man , the best course of action is to run .
no !
come on .
get back !
outta the way !
shit !
okay .
fuck .
the ride's over .
he had me deliver the ticket ... ... 'cause you hung around with my brother .
i knew you wouldn't go for it !
who sent you?
i can't tell you that .
did you have something to do with it?
i had nothing to do with richie .
then give me a name , or you're history .
brumby's in the back .
carter?
so , now you're a travel agent .
what?
that was a real nice touch , sending thorpey .
very nostalgic .
what are you talking about?
what'd richie have on you?
bloody hell , jack !
richie was my friend .
what does it take , a fucking miracle for you to believe that?
you're not giving me anything here .
all right , jack .
stop that , for fuck's sake .
look , okay .
i owed this bloke some money .
he fronted a truck load last year to extend the club .
he calls me this afternoon , says he'll wipe the slate clean ... ... if i'll do this thing for him .
he said he wanted you out of town .
that's all .
he didn't say how , just out of town .
you're brother was my friend .
i wouldn't hurt him .
give me a name or this is going to another level .
cyrus paice .
you want me out?
you want me out?
you want to do this?
rabbit's outta the hat , jack .
let's see if it jumps .
what did you do to richie?
goddamn you !
i didn't do nothing .
i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but you're chasing your ass .
you were gone too long , brother .
shit changes .
maybe not you , but some shit does change .
your brother , your precious brother richie ... ... was no goddamn saint .
everybody's into something , jack .
plain and simple , all right?
there's no mystery , no intrigue .
he got juiced up one night , he got oiled up ... ... and he wrapped his sorry ass around a tree .
end of story .
now if you wanna do this little dance here for old time's sake ... ... bring it .
let me tell you something .
you'll end up like a one legged man ... ... in an ass kicking contest .
i'm tired of your bullshit , jack .
i'm a businessman .
i got ladies waiting for me on the inside .
grow up , jack .
uncle jack !
i didn't think you were gonna show up .
i was in the neighborhood .
listen , doreen , i'm out having one of those ... ... year long nights and i'm not much fun to be around .
maybe we oughta take a rain check on this .
okay?
okay .
'bye .
i'll give you a call tomorrow .
you hungry?
a little .
you drink coffee?
yeah .
i smoke , too .
i don't know if that's worth bragging about , do you?
you smoke .
well , i did , but i just recently quit .
yeah?
when?
i'd say about now .
so , if you don't mind ....
makes you nuts , doesn't it?
it's having an impact , yes .
you are so freaky !
well , we're all a little freaky , doreen .
it's the straight ones we got to worry about .
what do you do for work?
what did your father tell you?
he didn't .
that's good .
mom said you were a gambler .
isn't that illegal?
are you a bookie?
bookie?
no .
more like ... ... a financial adjuster .
have you ever been to prison?
for how long?
how about this weather?
come on !
what do you say we change the subject?
all right .
fine .
you ever shoot anybody?
you want to know what i do for a living?
simple .
people make promises and they break them .
my job is to refresh their memory .
that's about it .
no big deal .
what's with the clothes?
what's with the jewelry in your face?
you don't like it .
it's nice .
you ever been married?
i don't think so .
so , you don't have a family of your own .
what are you?
why'd you leave?
well , doreen , that's a long , long story .
it's a long , long ride .
let's put it this way : did you ever want to take every mirror in the world and ... ... get rid of it 'cause you didn't like what was coming back at you?
yeah .
i wish my dad was here .
me too .
do you really think somebody killed him?
yeah , i think so , but ....
me too .
do you have a license yet?
yep .
what , did you learn that in school?
dad taught me .
yeah?
doreen , would you wait in the car?
why?
it's all right .
please wait in the car .
i'll be right back .
it's okay .
if you need help , hang up and then dial the operator .
you okay?
have you seen doreen?
what happened?
i have no idea where she is .
who did it?
he came in , i don't know .
are you okay?
it's gonna be all right .
really .
why did they do this?
i don't know .
but i want to find out , you can believe that .
come on , let's go get your mom .
where are we going?
i want you guys to stay with me tonight , okay?
gloria , why don't we get out of here?
i'm fine .
i'm okay .
i need to talk to your uncle jack alone .
what's wrong?
i need you to leave , jack .
what?
my mom's coming over .
we'll go to her place tonight and we'll stay there .
listen , i know that you want to help .
but just look around you .
look what you brought into my house .
look at my face .
look at my family .
you're not helping .
so please go .
what did you say?
i brought in " i didn't bring anything into this house .
i just want to know the truth .
what the hell was richie into?
oh , god !
my head hurts .
that's all right , gloria .
whatever this costs , i'll just take care of it , all right?
you and doreen should get out of town .
take a vacation .
i'll take care of that , too .
you shouldn't be here .
we're fine .
just go .
i'm sorry , gloria .
i snuck out .
took a cab .
grandma's house smells funny .
do you want to come in?
nice tattoos .
i'll bring her by in the morning .
yeah , i promise .
all right .
goodnight .
your mother is a little upset .
it was your idea to call her .
listen , i don't mind .
she cares about you , she loves you .
that's pretty special .
listen , you got one mother , right?
it's a real scary place out there , so i don't blame her .
you must be a little tired .
i'll tell you what : why don't you take the bed?
i got a lot of work to do in the other room .
i'll take you home in the morning , okay?
it's gonna be all right , really .
i was coming for you .
bet you didn't know you had a fairy godmother , jack .
you gave my brother a disc .
what was on it?
a fairy godmother all of your own .
don't play me , geraldine , all right?
no more games .
no more dress up .
you understand?
you gave my brother a disc .
what was on it?
i don't know what ....
i'll tell you something : if you lie to me i'm gonna break every listen to me .
i'm gonna break every beautiful bone in your body .
i'm not lying to you .
i'm just here 'cause he wanted to see you .
who?
the demon king .
he wanted to speak to you so he made some calls ... ... and he waved his magic wand and poof !

what happened to your face?
a couple of guys jumped me on the elevator on the way up .

i slipped , you know .
it happens sometimes when you get older , you know .
your ticket for your mustang .
i got it downstairs .
you probably should be getting back now .
what are you gonna do?
well , you know , i'm gonna be taking off today .
why?
well , it just worked out that way .
for good?
for a while .
doreen , before i go , i just ....
i just want to tell you , i think you're a special girl .
i mean that .
in just 48 hours ... ... i could see that .
things happen to us , doreen , you know .
we make mistakes .
we fall down and ... ... we get into trouble .
it happens to everybody .
it does .
but it doesn't mean ... ... everything that happened yesterday has to happen everyday .
it doesn't .
you don't want to do it like me and spend your whole life looking backwards .
you know , it is what it is .
we can't change our history .
we can't do that .
but you can go past it .
just right past it .
and you know , up ahead ... ... it's all new .
it's new , it's yours if you want it .
i got to tell you , your mother loves you .
no matter what you think , she loves you .
maybe you got things you have to talk to her about or some ... ... problems , whatever .
you should talk to her .
she'll listen .
i don't know what happened .
he worked with dad , he was always really nice .
i thought i ....
i mean ....
i thought it was gonna be cool .
fun , you know?
we had some champagne and he asked if i ... ... wanted to go to this party .
you should have seen my friends 'faces .
i don't even remember what happened .
i just remember ... ... not being able to move much .
i remember ... ... wanting to leave .
wanting it to stop .
wanting ... ... to go home .
it's all my fault .
no .
it's not your fault .
none of this is your fault .
you gotta believe that .
no .
none of this is your fault .
none of it .
yeah?
jack?
who is this?
it's geraldine .
look , i didn't know she was richie's daughter .
when i found out who she was , i got the disc to richie right away .
i didn't know what he'd do with it .
he went to them and he said he was taking the disc to the cops .
cyrus knows i gave him the disc .
he's on his way here .
he's coming over now , jack !
i didn't know who to call , i was just ....
shit !
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
where's eddie?
he's not working today .
where's he live?
what's going on?
where does he live?
will you listen to me?
for just a minute .
i've been in it all my life , on both sides of the ocean .
i'm telling you this , if you get mixed up in ... ... whatever it was your brother was into , you got a good chance ... ... to winding up exactly the same as he did .
and those two ladies are gonna have to go into mourning all over again .
getting yourself killed won't bring richie back .
revenge doesn't work .
sure it does .
they knew what they were getting into  don't play me !
that was cyrus 'deal , man !
he probably killed your brother .
right?
it wasn't fucking me !
he's at a fucking party right now ... ... at some fucking fencing club or something , with kinnear , right?
i was just fucking playing around !
go get them .
i'm having a really hard time understanding something , eddie .
what could she have done to you ... ... that was so bad that you'd want to do this to her?
'cause what you did doesn't go away !
she trusted you !
and you raped her .
she was my brother's daughter .
my family .
and it's my fault .
'cause if i had been here , this never would have gone down .
so now i gotta make it right .
i gotta do that .
i mean , what would you do if it was your daughter?
jack , don't kill me , man .
you killed yourself .
jack , stop !
get him !
go !
jack !
jack , stop !
goddamn it !
motherfucker !
fuck !
don't lose him .
straight on .
just get on him .
you cock sucker !
come on .
all right , move !
where is he?
man , jack !
here you go !
don't turn !
is this what you want?
shit .
sorry , mr. carter , you're not on the list .
nobody likes the list guy .
can i help you with something?
i don't think so .
jeremy kinnear .
look , mr. phone guy ... ... do you have any idea who i am?
i'll buy your goddamn hotel so i can fire you !
i wanna talk to mr. fletcher .
les fletcher .
no , you listen to me , you neophyte toady .
i am in the middle of a party here .
i should not have to deal with this .
put me through to your boss !
listen , why don't you girls go in the back room?
i'll meet you back there .
i've got some things to take care of .
did you know who she was?
excuse me?
did you knew she was my blood?
jack , are we gonna go through this goddamn little dance again?
go ahead .
take out your gun in front of all these people here .
put one right between my eyes .
i don't think you could handle jail for the rest of your life , jack .
i want to tell you something , slick .
the man you want ... ... is that little piss ass kinnear .
him and the old guy , so stop breaking my balls , all right?
i'm a goddamn businessman just trying to stay afloat , just like you .
you're nothing like me .
excuse me , wait a minute , jack .
all of a sudden you care?
all of a sudden what are you?
some kind of fucking good guy?
you're the bad brother , remember?
i know who i am .
listen , i would love to sit here and jaw with you ... ... but i gotta get back to the talent .
let it go .
come on , jack , let's see what you got .
jack , come on .
goddamn , jack .
your little brother put up a better fight than you did .
you should finish what you start .
fix your tie a little bit there .
have a good time .
where is it , richie?
you got a car?
let's take a ride .
where are we going , mr. carter?
slow down .
turn the lights back on , please .
i didn't do it .
will you slow down , please?
you're gonna kill us .
please !
what do you want , mr. carter?
you want a clean slate?
just give me five minutes in front of a laptop .
please slow down , you're gonna kill us !
that's the point , jeremy .
okay .
you want money?
you want money , name your price .
i've got more money than god !
you need a drink .
it's okay .
it's all right , jeremy .
is this how you did it to richie?
is this how you did it , jeremy?
you think he screamed too?
you like it?
i didn't kill your brother , mr. carter !
get up .
mr. carter , you're making a mistake .
get up .
move !
listen to me .
you're making a mistake .
cyrus told me your brother was going to go to the police with this disc .
he said if he went down , i'd go down .
i didn't know what to do , mr. carter .
so you had him killed .
no !
i just said to him to get the disc back , that's all .
i had nothing to do with it .
i swear .
i told cyrus to go and get the disc ... ... and that our business together would be over .
that's all .
mr. carter , i swear to you !
i swear to you !
i didn't do anything .
i didn't kill him , mr. carter , please believe me !
he said if i said anything ... ... he would ruin me !
and then you ... ... you came along .
please , mr. carter !
it was cyrus .
he killed your brother and geraldine , not me .
he said he was working with some guy .
it was them .
they did it .
no more talk .
turn around .
please , don't .
turn around .
be a man , for once in your life .
i'm gonna do something for you ... ... nobody ever did for me .
i'm gonna give you a second chance .
please don't make me come back .
no .
no .
i won't , mr. carter .
thank you .
thank you so much .
i promise i won't make you come back .
thank you .
what are you doing?
sorry , jack .
i don't usually get my hands dirty , but i checked your room ... ... and there was nothing there .
listen .
about this ... ... doreen thing .
she'll be all right , i think .
kids are resilient , you know .
and this thing with richie , i mean , christ , that was bloody awful .
i don't know what cyrus was thinking , but ... ... a man's got to make a living .
i tried to keep you out of it , but you insisted on this post facto ... ... big brother thing .
so , i figured ... ... if i left enough dangling ... ... you would find my disc for me .
what a mess .
all over a shiny piece of plastic .
listen .
i'll get rid of the disc .
you seem to have gotten rid of everything else .
you may have hardware concealed about your person .
if you kill me , you'll be on the run for the rest of your life .
it's been nice knowing you , jack .
brumby .
i'm not turning around .
suit yourself .
uncle jack .
your mother told me i'd find you here .
i thought you were gone .
i am gone .
i just wanted to come by ... ... say goodbye to you , face to face .
what happened to your beard thing?
that?
i thought it would be time for a change .
i just got rid of it .
did you fall again?
this?
yeah , i did .
i fell down again .
get new shoes .
we're gonna be okay , you know .
mom and me .
i know .
thanks for being here .
it would've meant a lot to dad .
he was a good man .
yeah .
guess you gotta go?
yeah .
do you remember when i said , " you're special "?
you better remember that or you're gonna have a big problem with me , okay?
take care of yourself , doreen .
you too .
i like the new look .
