i'm the producer , sergei .
we're a small new company ...

as in birds .
look at that shot !
it's innocent tales of youth ...

red bandlts
a sophisticated melodrama .
djordje , would you please turn off that projector?
can't you see we have an agent here? !
is that better?
not agent , i mean ... more like a guest .
sergei !
did you tell this jackass not to drive me home anymore?
call me a jackass again and i'll fuck you !
i dare you to repeat that in front of sergei !
we've got a guest .
quiet down .
our guest .
ivana gvozdenovic , the famous actress .
the man probably knows me .
i'll kill you for that .
ah , here's dusan .
tell him what you said a minute ago .
she called me a jackass .
did you really?
yeah , and then he said he'd fuck me !
did you really?
no .

no one said anything to anyone .
sergei , it's that ugrinovic again .
are you here or not?
god , bosiljka , you ask some stupid questions .
you can see i'm here .
tell him i'm in a meeting .
you know what , mr. ugrinovic .
he's here but he's not here .
well , yes .
that's what us filmmakers say .
the ministry of culture is a great help .

yes .
mrs minister and i are close friends , so she puts her ...

lf we're thinking of the same harvey ... and if we're thinking of belgrade , our belgrade ...
that harvey ...
there'll be war .
there'll be war .
there's a problem with his money .
due to the imminent danger of war we blocked his money .
idiot left it in the bank .
we reckon he belongs to some fairly suspicious groups .
harvey? !
yes .
do you know harvey?
he's like a little baby .
the worst kind .
that money , you know .
it's not his money .
he invested it in our film , so now it's ours .
you're right , the money's ours .
here , take this .
if he contacts you , call me .
i hope we can sort this out .
thank you .
wonderful place this .

i'm half way through filming .
it's not?

dusan , why are we doing it again?

i had no idea .
who stopped the shooting?

if he left any tracking devices , call me immediately .

if you notice anything suspicious , ring me .
fucking cunts !
mother fuckers ...
what are you going to do now , dusan?
let this beautiful part of mine go to waste?
like fuck they won't start on us .
we're warriors , eh?
they'll ruin us .
we won't recover for 100 years .
we wanted the yanks to think we were tough .
dusan , if you've got nothing clever to say , shut up .
have a think and let me know when we'll start shooting again , realistically .
and i mean realistically .
realistically !
wait !
wait !
no one from number 45 and only 8 from number 30 .

you'll kill us all !
we'll go by the list .
i've got kid .

ivana , you forgot your hairdryer ... ... and your curlers .
ahh , our famous actress !
please , go in !
i have to as well ...

oh , fucking hell ...
where's the american?
mind your own business .
it's a government matter .
let me introduce myself .
i am mileta .
from secret service .
where do you think you're going mother fucker?
bosa said we've finished filming .
bosa?
who?
who told you to pack up?
bosa says filming's over .
put everything back !
you think you can decide when to stop shooting?
you all need a damn good kick up the arse .
fucking slave driver .
what's up?
a few bombs and you artists shit your pants !
it's ok for mr. producer to show up when the war's over !
bombs are falling , and he ...
cut the crap , tatula !
what did he say?
he said you're a deaf commie .
what?
i didn't hear .
the sirens went off and then the windows smashed ... where?
upstairs .
it seems anyone can stop filming whenever they want !
i can stop whenever i want !
you haven't paid us .
there's no money for the tapes .
and you strut around belgrade with that american .
i don't want to see him ever again .
anywhere .
is that clear?
if you want to know who stopped filming , i'll tell you .
he did !
and as for communism , that's none of your business .
what's that about communism?
he's winding you up .
you want me to kick the shit out of you , huh?
what shall i do with this guy?
who is it?
ugrinovic again?
no , the police .
please , don't take him to my place .
my mom's sick .
hey , sergei , sorry i'm late .
tatula's only j ... j ... just told me about the money .
pay day , eh !?
no .
tatula , you f ... f ... fucking lying bastard .
why's he b ... b ... bleeding?
yeah !
we're at home lola , where else?
no , the phone's in the other room .
masa's sleeping .
everything's fine .
we're waiting for you .
good evening .
good evening .
good evening .
daddy said that you're the best guy in the crew .
really?
and did daddy bring any money?
no .
but he brought harvey to sleep at your place .
good evening .
i'll throw both of you off the balcony .
not in front of the kid , tatula .
shh , i've only just got her off to sleep .
idiot .
what's happening , sergei?
what'll become of us?
where've you been the whole night?
which question do you want me to answer first?
you're probably the only man not to come home tonight .
there was a problem on set .
fuck the set !
don't swear .
why were the police looking for you?
where were they looking for me?
here .
they left this .
they were here , too?
what's going on , segei?
it's because of harvey ...
our harvey?
he's an american , and so they hate him .
why are they bombing us?
war is the best business .
it'll only be for a few days .
what does 'a few days 'mean?
it means this isn't one of your big wars like 1941 .
how can you eat now?
what?
i'm supposed to starve because there's a war on .
even in world war two people still ate .
fuck , there they go again .
you know , these planes are really turning me on .
get lost , sergei .
they say sex is best when bombs are falling .
honestly !
a guy from sarajevo told me .
it's crazy .
you make love like it's your last time ever .
and what did he say?
who?
ah , that guy .
he said he did it 6 times .
twice will do me .
masa .
damn you .
smile !
cheers .
you bombed belgrade ... ... in 1945 .
at easter .
and we were allies , friends .
yeah , yeah ...
what?
you want something , someone ...?
there isn't anyone .
all the women are underground ... ... in the shelters .
6th aprll 1941
the germans bombed belgrade
thls is how belgrade looked in aprll 1941
fllmed by an amateur belgrade cameraman .
bosa !
listen to me .
you know what you have to do?
i know .
first ring him .
i know .
on the telephone .
you know what to tell him?
of course i do .
go on then , and don't screw up .
when have i ever screwed up?
when haven't you?
so ...
you must have the last word ...
that's not true .
don't you know there's a war on?
so what?
look , bosa's been injured .
it's serious .
put on something decent .
we've got to go to her parents '.
quick .
as if you'd have come with me any other way .
stop the car .
i'm getting out .
wait .
i remembered that film of yours last night ... ... the one you were thrown out of the academy for .
piss off .
man , that was an ingenious film .
what was the name of that young actress i screwed?
milica?
yeah , milica .
nice chick .
i heard she hanged herself after that .
that was your greatest film .
i realized then we'd work together on something big .
it was badly edited .
i didn't like it .
thank god it was in black and white .
excellent story !
a romance between a german officer ... and a resistance girl in occupied belgrade .
yeah , it was really funny !
so , we've got an excellent story .
we've got the crew , the camera , the tape , we've got harvey .
and we've got war !
get it?
he's crazy .
he's off his head .
i don't give a damn .
go on , harvey .
you're a real serb !
they'll arrest us all !
he's ok .
he'll make a good actor .
maybe .
they're all here .
we've got to hurry .
is this any way to begin a press conference?
fucking hell .
what did he drink?
tatula's homemade shit .
ouch !
i told him just a drop .
come on , bosa .
guys .
i'll be doing the killing , jerk !
yesterday belgrade came under heavy bombardment .
our beloved country was attacked without mercy .
nineteen countries began an all out war ... ... against our oppressed nation .
that's a lot !
i believe the time has come ... ... to rise up and defend our homeland .
for you , comrade tito .
tatula !
as you know we recently began filming our latest film ... ... 'chicken '.
the people here before you now were at work yesterday ... ... when the enemy dropped its first bomb on our brave land .
they stayed at work , filming in the face of the enemy .
i don't normally do this but i would ask for ... ... a warm round of applause for these brave souls .
bravo !
thank you .
thank you , heroes !
but whilst bombs fall , with us here , there's an american ... ... brave enough to say a historical 'no '... to his president , his country , and their evil .
plus , he decided to invest his hard earned money ... from who knows what ... maybe the oil platforms ... in our film .
our serbian film !
the wartime love story of an american and a serbian girl .
what's more , the american will star in it .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... i give you the one and only living american in belgrade ... ... mr. harvey jackson .
bravo !
bravo !
here we go again .
working without pay .
finally i'd like to mention a typically artistic gesture ... ... made by the old but enthusiastic tatula .
this brave soundman has told me today ...
he doesn't want one cent for the film .
he said to me
'friend , take my pay and spend it the way you know best . '
now you see what serb film hands are made of !
bravo tatula !
bravo !
thank you everyone .
we'll take questions over cocktails downstairs .
tell everyone about this .
filming starts tomorrow .
long live art !
long live serbia !
congratulations !
thank you .
you're a very cunning man .
the heavy artillery , a press conference , journalists , tv ... ... and all that to save a yankee , eh?
no .
no?
is it then to save his money , eh?
because you need it for the film?
well , there can't be a film without money .
he spoke like the president .
what charisma !
you mean inside?
there as well .
filmmaking during war is an unpredictable matter .
like penalties .
a lottery .
hi , i'm djole , director of photography .
irresistible djole !
we must use all our weapons .
including film .
i think you've underestimated its value up till now .
me?
not you personally .
film is a powerful weapon .
take this press conference .
tonight it'll be shown all round the globe .
if you don't want this crew though ...
the media war must be fought more seriously this time .
being humane is very important right now .
not only us film guys , but you television guys as well .
everyone .
everyone .
why all this patriotism?
are you sick?
why?
you artists aren't exactly the state's best buddies .
it's not you and us anymore .
the first bomb's been dropped .
now we're one .
clearly the whole thing has fermented ... ... and is more elaborate , structurally speaking .
the woman i play is the bravest creature i've known .
i haven't got to know her yet , but i'm working on it .
it's not easy .
she's deep ... ... but that's a greater challenge for us actresses .
it's easy when there's peace , but now when it's ... shit happens ...
sorry , viewers !
thank you .
what?
do you really think he can act?
harvey?
harvey's amazing .
all americans can act .
two of their presidents were actors .
who was the second?
oh yeah !
this one's a musician .
he doesn't look like an actor to me .
what does that matter?
an actor doesn't have to be handsome .
everything's been worked out .
we just need a bit of money .
if you do as you say , that won't be a problem .
dule , bullshit something !
i can't do it all by myself .
yeah , right !
he's never been in cinema .
fuck depleted uranium , depleted war ...
what are you looking at?
i know there was a siren , lola .
i heard it .
i'm in a meeting .
i'll be 5 minutes .
how's masa?
3 minutes .
stay calm .
ok , 2 minutes ...
mlner's hand are covered in blood
chlld crles in the war flame
you're gone and so is your dress ,
wlll the sun ever shlne on us
a llttle vlolet dress , you were wearlng

what was that?

no need to shit yourself from one bomb .
go on , play !
don't screw around .
three , four .
a llttle vlolet dress , you were wearlng
when you went to klss hlm , and you were my true love
bravo , four eyes !
do you like the movies?
i like sport as well .
your colleague's ukrainian , eh?
handsome guy .
we make a film , they bomb us , each to his own ...
but maybe we'll make a good film ...
i think sergei fucked up .
guys , i've n ... n ... never heard such crap .
no , the story's ok , but where did they find this guy?
first , he's no actor , second he's american .
never !
the yank's better than lvana , isn't he aca?
a million times .
she's such a bore .
how can you say that dule's wife's a whore?
me?
i didn't .
shame on you .
you did , you did .
honestly i didn't .
look !
good hit !
you've no chance .
we'll win .
serbia !
serbia !
hi , honey .
we're home .
who's 'we '?
harvey and i.
it's just for a few days ... or a few months , i promise .
good evening , lola .
good evening , harvey .
good thing the whole crew didn't come .
you're an idiot .
bombs , sirens , i'm home alone with masa ... ... and you're gallivanting around bars .
we were celebrating a bit .
today we began a new film .
so i saw .
it was on the state news .
the press conference?
yeah .
you and dule looked great .
you should think about taking up politics .
put on a few kilos and you'll be perfect .
bye !
what's up , sweetie?
are you a bit scared?
shall we frighten them off , masa?
how , daddy , when i can't see any of them?
nor can i.
they can see us .
yeah , they can , the bastards .
put your hand like this .
shoo , stupid planes .
shoo , stupid planes .
again !
shoo , stupid planes .
that's right .
why doesn't harvey join in?
he can't .
he's from their country .
they've gone , daddy .
you're not scared anymore?
no .
the theme's forbidden love .
just like in my student film .
the same bombing .
just it's an american instead of a german .
now , you hug not noticing the people gathering around you who have found out he's an american .
then you start kissing ...
kissing harvey?
yeah .
how?
pretend or real?
with tongues?
pretend .
in front of all these ... ... people in the bomb shelter .
they want to lynch you but ...
god , dusan . ... the yank , who's a total stranger somehow pulls out an
american flag ... and that's the crux of the film .
why?
because he burns it in front of everyone in the shelter .
to save himself and to show how much he loves you .
get it?
well , ok .
they are already starting to smile .
you carry on kissing .
they begin to clap .
then they start chanting more and more loudly
'serbia , serbia '.
he takes you in his arms ... ... and makes for the exit .
wow !
ugh , get lost !
it's just like in 'officer and a gentleman ', isn't it?
dule !
yeah?
this flag burning's great .
excellent stuff .
and harvey?
what about him?
what about him? !
he has to burn his country's flag .
who cares?
he's a bigger serb than the two of us .
will someone get that fucking phone !
just don't expect the film to be big in america .
well , the blacks will watch it .
what do we care?
hey , bosa , answer the phone !
fucking hell ...
what if we forget about burning the flag ... ... and they fuck under it instead?
ivana and harvey?
yeah .
you'll let lvana fuck that hulk?
why not?
lvana's a professional .
it's only film sex .
i know , but screwing in a shelter !
i don't know ...
if i had it my way , i'd make the yank a totally good guy .
are you crazy?
that's why i say let's forget politics .
we'll do an ordinary love story about two people ... ... going out in belgrade , screwing in the shelters .
no pictures to take of the war , nor of the bombing .
and finish the film with a shot of our execution !
listen .
don't complicate things .
don't dodge the bombing bit when it's actually happening .
sergei , i'm out of here .
why do we need a s ... s ... set?
take a camera , w ... w ... walk outside and ... ... there's much better shots everywhere .
you don't need me .
besides , i g ... g ... got called up .
i've got to make m ... m ... mock up planes at the airbase .
not you as well , aca !
what planes?
unbelievable .
each evening ... 8 .
15 sharp .
you can set you w ... w ... watch by it .
they're either stupid or ... ... they just keep dropping bombs on them .
off you go then , aca !
a bomb will hit you ... ... our guys will jump into bed with the yanks soon ... ... and you'll be six foot under .
fine , aca .
finish up and go .
how will we end the film?
the war ends , and we ...
win? !
ok , don't fuck around .
who knows how this shit will end !
how will it end?
they can't just drop bombs on belgrade .
the world will rise up .
the russians , the chinese ...
don't give a shit , sergei !
forget about the russians and the chinese .
they'll fuck us so hard , our eyes will pop out .
the story's so imbecilic , it'll sell everywhere .
don't be stupid and ruin our chances of big bucks .
ok , relax !
all i'm saying is add in some patriotic stuff .
the war ends and we've got a big film .
how do i look?
ivana , we're not filming " versace's murder " .
this is a war film .
find something more suitable .
fine , and why are we going to screw in a bomb shelter?
where do you want to screw him?
in the hyatt hotel?
we're being bombed , for god's sake !
so , what?
i have to strip off in front of my neighbors?
what's he aiming at , sergei?
a balkan romeo and juliet .
ahh , juliet .
how cute !
why didn't you say so , dusan?
dusan , get our friend harvey to burn the flag .
you can always cut it out after if you don't like it ...
bosa , why are you messing around?
look at him , like mccloud himself .
how i love this war !
senka !
her name's senka !
shit , he's bloody useless .
lie a bit , guys , else he'll walk out .
come on , bosa .
well done , harvey !
this is amazing .
once more , only without acting .
without acting?
do you fancy a drive?
maybe in some other life .
how about like this?
don't guys , he's on our side .
he loves serbia .
that's it .
great , honey !
come on , guys , let's go .
while the iron's hot .
we'll can it this time .
quiet !
ready !
scene 5 , shot 8 , take 24 .
action !
calm down , guys .
he's on our side .
he loves serbia .
so why doesn't he burn the flag?
he doesn't have to burn the flag .
we'll film a close up using someone else .
why shouldn't he , dusan?
yeah , why shouldn't he?
who the hell's he?
get out , now !
i'm in charge of the shelter .
what's happening?
no one said cut !
ok , guys .
calm down .
it's war .
we're all a bit edgy .
he'd better burn the flag !
bloody traitor !
guys , this isn't for real .
why can't you see?
he's one of us .
he loves serbia .
serbia !
serbia !
they'll kill him .
he'd better burn the thing .
burn it , harvey .
burn that shit .
burn the flag .
serbia !
serbia !
sergei , what now?
teach him to act .
you managed with lvana .
fine .
that's not a problem .
wood could act better though .
but they wanted to lynch us on day one .
it'll be the same every day .
it'll only last another couple of days .
that's all we need .
that's the last time i'm going to save this asshole .
what? !
we should have let them beat him up?
what if some black guys grabbed you to do you over?
jackass !
you know , it's war .
people are upset ... ... angry .
but , the sort of film i want to make ... ... won't get past the government .
no way !
and without sponsor's approval there is no money .
sponsors , my ass !
after what happened today , we are finished .
dusan !
what now , lvana?
help me .
tell him i'm sorry .
yeah right !
i don't give a damn .
well , he was good .
it's obvious he's got talent .
my prick is more talented !
maybe it's better that they don't deposit the money .
so , we save our asses . ... while we still can .
gentlemen !
i hear we've made a successful start .
what's up , luvvies?
what are you planning?
it looks like the problem's been solved for us .
give me a glass !
harvey !
harvey !
cheers !
cheers !

nelghbours and frlends dashed in front of the camera in
thelr deslre to embrace mr. harvey ,

real nice !
mr. harvey , we thank you .
you've started working for them openly .
working for who?
the government .
and who should i work for?
nato?
forget about enemies and bombs .
just answer me this .
what happened to your integrity and honesty? ... you were fighting for truth .
and what are you doing now?
what i've been doing my whole life .
i'm a filmmaker .
you sold your soul to them , sergei .
and for what?
a few dollars , power , a medal .
what's up with you , lola?
i'm just trying to make a movie .
why's that so bad?
you've never been like th ...
shut up !
my name is senka .
i don't talk to americans .
what's up , lola?
it's me , your sergei .
you know , that tall , dark , handsome guy ... ... with the huge ...
iq .
masa , is he a real american?

come on , sergei , please !
let's leave .
you , me and masa .
please .

you know everything's sorted out .
we only have to leave .
while you can still get out of this shit .

mummy , i've been acting with uncle harvey .
yes?
that's me .
how much?
thanks .
our government has given green light .
cut !
even more .
i want you bursting with joy .
you've done this very well .
the bombing is just like the real thing .
even better .
i need even more for it to be more realistic .
madam minister , if our film looked as beautiful as you ... ... we would do well .
let's take it again .
hang on a second .
the minister of culture would like to say a few words .
quiet , bosa !
my dear artists !
bravo ! " .
thank you .
madam minister , could you repeat that for state tv?
just make it a bit more attractive .
snow , rain , wind ... snow in april?
at this time when the nation is suffering ...
then make the explosions louder .
i have just one word ...
so ... do we get money ... for licking the minister's ass?
shit , you communists only have money on the mind .
allow me !
it came to mind .
maybe ...
i don't want to interfere ...
cut !
brilliant !
fucking hell !
he , that ...
american . ... could still be portrayed as a human being .
you know , after all we are all ...
of course .
for instance , we could ... ... have him save the child in this scene .
or these doctors .
you could?
unbelievable .
amazing , truly amazing .
maybe though ... ... he should be killed at the end by his own people .
that would be a kind of justice .
it is war after all , isn't it?
that isn't in the script?
no , it isn't .
cut !
stop the rain !
3 , 4 , end .
stop the rain .
excellent .
djole?
it's good for me .
that's a wrap .
you don't w ... w ... want your beans?
no .
take them .
you should feed yourself up so we can win the war .
if only they'd g ... g ... go below 5000 meters .
don't give me that war shit .
it's the same for us all .
only i'm not fucking around .
i'm working ...
what do you reckon?
are those two going to f ... f ... fuck?
what?
you think they'll just hold hands?
what's he saying?
he wants to fuck you , as you're so up for it .
what's he really saying , dusan?
so they've started to fuck us on the ground as well !
you couldn't wait for war to sit around on your fat ass .
listen , ugrinovic .
if you've got no dinars , pay in dollars .
what are you doing , bosiljka?
i'm just trying it .
pay it first thing tomorrow , or else .
look , american .
so much for your invisible plane .
we shat on it .
now it's visible .
little shit .
it's alright for them to take it away ... ... but when the people want it back ...
what's up , bosiljka?
i just want to try it .
go on then , try it .
they're done for !
how did they hit it if they couldn't see it?
military secret .
w ...
w ...
why wasn't i there?
fuckers !
hey , what are you doing tonight?
thank god , you've finally remembered !
ten o'clock , yeah?
but where?
djole , come here .
they're spending a lot .
let them .
what do you care?
how's the crane?
you're crazy , man .
what's wrong with it?
nothing .
i've always wanted something like this .
where did you get it?
a present from cnn .
come on , guys !
let's do some work !
ok .
come on .
sorry !
i've got to try it .

dusan , why won't you tell me?
shit , man !
it's not m ... m ... me this time , guys .
how much longer?
how fucking long will you fuckers go fucking on?
i don't believe this .
everyone's in the shelter , and we're on the terrace .
we're watching war live out in the fresh air .
hi , bosa !
where are you off to?
for some wine .
i drink and drink , but i can't get drunk .
hang on , where've you been?
what?
where've you been?
with a ... young female colleague .
checking some lenses ...
good evening , buddy .
evening , djole .
i've something serious to ask you .
have you bedded that camerawoman yet?
get away ...
so you haven't .
she's not that kind of girl .
so you have .
we went out together for the first time today .
what does it matter how many times?
it's war .
when i can look after her , i can .
if i'm filming , i can't .
hey , does this go?
where's masa?
she's downstairs in the shelter with the other kids .
they love it down there at the moment .
ah , so the kids are doing ok , eh?
you think so , eh?
ok , so what's wrong now?
nothing .
i didn't know my kid would grow up in a shelter .
so?
our parents did too , and they were ok .
they were missing half a brain to have made a country like this .
oh , lola ...
don't complain !
i'm killing myself making a film about you , and your ...
i'm sorry , and how does that film end?
what happens to that brave doctor?
that's not in the script .
we haven't decided yet .
you mean you're negotiating with the cop over the ending .
look , sergei .
if you want the film to be truthful ... ... and that woman really to be like me , then you can write ... write that the doctor packs her bags ... ... and leaves for germany with her daughter .
sorry , what are you talking about?
fade to black ... the end .
they're pounding us tonight .
i'm heading s ... s ... south tomorrow .
i swear i'll get even .
again?
after parading around in that uniform for 10 days !
if you're going , go !
you might be joking , tatula , but i'm serious .
i'm off tomorrow .
go then , man .
you want me to i ...
i ... leave now , huh?
why don't you?
now?
now , now !
what the fuck's wrong with you , eh?
go now !
you'll go when it's all over .
it's too late then .
don't you believe me?
not a word .
here , look !
what is it?
my draft letter .
kosovo .
happy now?
you're worse than them up there .
what's up?
nothing ...
aca's ...
shut up !
going to kosovo .
idiot .
hey , mileta ...
wiggle that ass .
how long's this shit going to last?
until we win .
in the film we're winning ; that's all that matters .
now you'll see how we catch spies !
come here , spy !
mileta , look at this , eh !?
go on , bosa?
hang on !
quiet !
when?
ok .
aca's going to kosovo .
give him leave for 2 weeks , please .
you can easily make a
mlg , but try making a film in 2 weeks !
go on !
i can't .
not a hope in hell ... he can have 2 days .
come on , go and pack .
stop it , mileta .
why do you want me to come back when i don't want to?
how can i look people in the eyes?
they're in k ...
k ... osovo and i'm on the s ... s ... set .
forget kosovo !
we've got to finish the film .
besides bosa's crying non stop ...
bosa cries at cartoons .
two days .
come here , sergei .
two weeks .
hey , that's not a bad idea .
what?
that his own people kill him .
well done , aca .
look , now it hits the camera .
shame !
why?
the acting was excellent .
what shall i write?
this one's the best .
the first and the third .
take the second one as well , bosa .
just in case .
44 8 take 1 .
that 's enough smoke , aca .
the way you act , it 's b ... b ... better we don 't see !
why does it have to be him?
can 't it be someone else?
no , it can 't .
shut up , bitch !
let go of me !
i 'm not going to the army .
see , he says he 's not going .
stop taking pictures , fatso !
well done , harvey !
cool !
well done !
i won 't go to the army !
i won 't !
i won 't !
run then , bro !
he 's an american .
don 't lay a finger on him .
an american , eh?
this is a classic !
don't change anything .
cut !
excellent !
you can belt him even harder , just mind the set .
look what you did to him !
the camera 's still running .
you 're wasting tape .
hungover , eh , mile?
i thought you were a good guy ... ... wanting to help his country .
you're just a bunch of assholes making films with other people's money , telling the world the worst lies about your nation .
you're artists and think you're entitled to do it .
i hate the movie ... ... and you disgust me !
wait .
it's not like that .
shut up when i'm talking .
what's the problem?
you don't know , eh?
don't play the innocent .
the nation's being destroyed , children are dying , blood's being shed .
the world's competing to see who can harm us most and you lot are fucking around .
what's the matter , luvvie?
you don't like the movie?
no .
i just thought there's some misunderstanding , so ...
there's no misunderstanding .
it's all as clear as day .
only this isn't the film we wanted , it's a mockery .
there are many different ways of making a patriotic film .
i can't make a film with evil americans and good serbs .
yet you can make love scenes with the yank and our doctor .
this is the greatest tragedy your nation has ever seen and you don't give a damn .
what makes you so scared of offending the west?
can't a serb girl hate an american? !
even when they are bombing us !
i'll teach you how to make a film ... ... how to hate your enemies and to love your country .
you don't know who you're dealing with .
sergei !
what's happened , bosa?
they've said the hospital's been hit .
lola , where's masa?
take his pulse .
he's lost a lot of blood .
well , where is she?
masa , masa !
masa !
sergei , we're leaving .
you've got 2 days to decide if you want to leave with us .
she'll never hear sirens again .
never .
does anyone want to tell me what's happening?
bosa , why's that guy so pissed at us?
and you , dusan , are you going to let him stop the shooting?
when i'm doing the best role of my career .
good afternoon , everyone .
good afternoon .
sorry i'm late .
we've got to pull ourselves together .
what's filmed is filmed , but we can't carry on like that .
we can't mess around while the country's bleeding .
nobody's messing around .
we are making a film , well i am .
why are you giving me a hard time?
go on , tell us .
tell you what?
if we film anything , it has to be the truth about the tragedy our people are suffering .
what truth , sergei?
don't give me that propaganda bullshit .
have we got to change the whole story?
don't screw me around !
we're not changing anything .
everything stays as it is .
a love story .
only we'll be on location more .
we'll go outside , so we can see what they're doing to us .
half the country's been ruined .
we'll put in some authentic , true life shots .
authentic shots .
fine , and the story?
what are we going to do with the characters?
with harvey?
harvey dies trying to save his true love .
ivana could die as well .
that's up to you .
ivana can't get killed .
shut up , lvana .
tell me , please , why harvey has to die?
because i'm sick of us ass licking the americans .
nor do i want us all to look like traitorous pussies .
don't give me all that shit about patriots and traitors .
i well know how you became a patriot .
your bollocks are on the line and you want us to save them .
well , fuck it !
i won't direct that kind of film .
you do it , if you want to .
dule ...
better still , get that cop to direct it .
wait , dule ...
it's ok , bosa .
kids !
kids !
when we began this film , things were different .
people are dying .
i agree .
let's stop filming and wait till the war's over .
what !
stop filming because of that idiot ...
what's he saying?
bravo , harvey !
if we stop filming , we've achieved nothing .
this way we still have a chance .
it's all the s ... s ... same to me ...
i'm heading s ... s ... south ...
listen , dule .
i can get hold of some amazing authentic material .
my girl works on the state tv news , so don't worry .
ok , djole .
go to the tv station and pick out the most dramatic stuff .
i need two days to sort out the script .
that's that .
then we're all agreed?
i don't get where we fucked up .
it was going so well .
we're still filming .
we've still got a chance .
see?
i think we've lost the plot though .
lost?
what if the russians get involved?
forget about the russians .
go on .
you laugh .
see you .
tatula?
we're off to the tv station to get some footage she found to surprise serge .
yeah , yeah !
no , honestly .
who gives a damn about the film right now?
it takes balls to make a film while there's a war on .
see you .
aca's gone .
to kosovo?
how can we make a film while bombs are falling? " ... ... you once asked me .
it's not just any old film .
it takes courage to make because it's after the truth , without compromises , without ideology , without politics , without dreams of success , without donations , without money , without winners and losers decided in advance .
so ...
don't overdo it , serge , " you told me .
of all of us , djole was the best .
his life was more truthful and more important ... ... than the search for truth ... ... than politics ... ... than the film itself .
and so today , we bury our film together with him .
dear djole ...
... may you rest in peace .
rest in peace .
are you sure we should go?
i'm sure . ... more than 20 dead and serlously hurt journallsts
producers , asslstants and other members of technlcal
stuff .
parts of human bodles are found in church yard 300 meters away from state tv bulldlng .
daddy , there's a cool zoo where mommy's taking me .
there's everything there , honey .
call as soon as you get there .
what about you?
when will you come?
i've explained everything to you .
you know everything .
wow , cool .
hold it !
bye , my love .
have you really let the crew go?
yeah .
what?
no more movie?
let's stop the games , mileta .
of course there's no more movie .
a man died .
my friend .
a great guy .
do you know how many of my guys have lost their lives?
all great guys .
have you any idea , eh?
i know .
they're soldiers .
real heroes .
we know how to make films about them ... ... about make believe death .
when it's real though , we can't handle it so well .
what can i say?
i made a mistake .
my fault .
yours?
i thought it was theirs , them with the bombs .
whatever .
the movie's off .
there's a lot of people interested in this movie .
i think it's out of our hands now .
use your head .
this studio looks kind of sad without a crew .
go on , call them back and start filming again .
mileta !
see you some day when things get better .
whllst the majorlty of our natlon are bravely defendlng
the homeland , heads held hlgh splting the nato aggressor ,
certaln corrupt traltors succumb to the lure of
western capltal and the conformlst phllosophy .
on the pretext of maklng a movle ,
thls group of forelgn agents are taklng part in spylng ...
what's this program?
look , it's you lot .
i never knew you were spies .
some new stars in our sky of spies .
now when you go outside , the nation will rip you apart in their adoration .
you know that's not true .
it's on tv .
but you know it's not the truth .
as far as the public are concerned , it's the truth .
you can explain to them after , that it's not true ... ... there's not much to say .
the man was susplcious from the outset .
there were the telephone calls to unbellev ...
it's a tape .
i wanted to hear your professional opinions .
can this make the headlines?
what did you think?
the state pays you to fuck around?
who's for going back to work?
i'm glad it's unanimous .
well done .
you're free to go .
tell the american the plot of our latest movie on your way .
thank you very much .
i don't need you anymore .
stay away from the studio .
is that clear?
go on , get lost !
dad , it 's masa .
why aren 't you answering the phone?
we 're in germany .
sergei?
there 's been no sign of you for days .
sergei , it 's bosa .
if you can , please ... ... please ring ...
80 8 4
action !
stop !
stop !
it's no good at all .
is it ... is it clear to you?
harvey's been killed by an american bomb .
his guys have killed him .
shaken , you take that flag and cover him .
touchingly .
and you with the camera go up , down and then in ... ... on a close up of those tears , to condemn the crime .
come on , you went to film school , didn't you?
come on .
sergej , it 's dule .
i must see you urgently .
urgently .
you're crazy coming to the set in that car .
mileta will suss us out straight away .
he's crazy .
do you know we're not allowed to mention your name on set?
careful , careful .
shut up , if he sees us here , he'll kill us .
we do as he tells us .
he is directing us now .
do you know mileta wants to blow up harvey?
give over .
we have to go to the airport to film them hitting mock ups .
he wants to tie him to a plane with a ton of explosives , to blow him to kingdom come .
i can't believe what i've got into .
at the end of filming , he'll shoot us all .
we know too much .
he told me this was the war against the whole orthodox world .
sergei , brother , save us .
otherwise we're all collateral damage .
and don't tell anyone about this .
bye .
there 's been no sign of you for days .
sergei , it 's bosa .
if you can , please ... please ring .
we 've got news about aca .
bye .
bosa , if i w ... w ... were to go again , would you see me off?
you know , when a soldier g ... g ... goes to the army ... ... and his mother prepares ... you c ... c ... could ... ... not like a mother , but like someone c ... c ... close .
i don't mean close like a g ... g ... girlfriend ... ... just like a f ... f ... friend .
there's 5 minutes of tape .
give it back in the morning .
i had trouble getting mileta to take the day off .
ok .
don't worry , it's all under control .
you know where to pick it up tomorrow .
ok , see you .
sergei .
what are you up to?
i never ask you where you're going ... ... but you always tell me .
and now you won't tell me .
don't think i'm asking you where you're going , but ...
wait !
oh , fucking hell ...
what's up , bosiljka?
didn't i tell you everything was under control?
don't be like that now .
trust me .
take care that you don't ...
that i don't screw up , huh?
you have to have the last word .
no , i don't .
everything's going to be blown up .
any second now .
it'll all be gone in 20 minutes .
or even 10 .
come on , love .
find me those negatives and hurry off home .
i've got to ring mileta .
guys , don't do that .
i shouldn't be telling you this , but ok .
mileta's gone to church .
and you know what that means?
do you want to tell me where you're taking him?
to the military hospital .
but i must call mileta .
on whose orders?
on his own .
go on then , ring him .
on your own head be it .
tell him everything i said .
go on , ring him .
i have to .
you have to?
look , i've got to go .
don't worry , they won't bomb you .
why would they want to hit a film lab?
bye !
this is a four star hotel .
all our food is all checked .
stars? !
poison is more likely !
he nearly died .
well what do you fucking want?
bravo .
success .
bye harvey .
sell the flat , half of it goes into this account in germany ; to my wife and the rest to my secretary .
bosa?
yeah , she's the one .
they'll need money for the film .
is the tape machine ready?
what tape machine?
yours .
you want my tape machine?
i'll look after it , don't worry .
you know what it's been through?
i know , all the war films .
bosa will bring it back tomorrow .
did you hear that milosevic would sign peace agreement?
i heard .
nice town , isn't it?
yeah , beautiful .
it survived this war as well .
it's just a shame i'll never come back here .
listen to him .
sergei got away from us .
like he's left the country .
there's no trace of him .
you lying bastard !
he's worse than us !
he's a greater liar than us !
what's up?
what do you mean he recorded his own death?
what?
how can a dead man film his own death?
mileta , sir , just to let you know .
i told your guys to ... ... he stole your film ...
what press conference?
there isn't one .
i didn't allow it .
listen !
get a team and arrest anything that moves .
but not before i give the sign .
this looks like a good spot to burn a film tonight .
and mileta can 't put this fire out .
mileta 's a silly little policeman shit .
to be or not to be , that is the question , i do believe .
i hope the american bustards are on time this evening .
mileta , this is your film .
it 's coming with me .
only angels will be able to watch it .
but i don 't think even they 'll want to .
bye .
dule , listen to me .
this should be the last scene of a film you must shoot about djole , aca , me and our stupid lives .
you 've got everything the story , war , laughter , politics , emotions , and a good ending .
with a victor who gets killed in front of cameras .
just don 't be sentimental , dule .
and bosa , don 't cry .
i 've gotta go .
it 'll be your greatest film .
thank you all for coming in such great numbers .
we were seeing pictures of tragic dead of our friend .
our enemies say they have intelligent bombs that strike only selected targets .
this time they selected well .
they destroyed one life , one film that wanted to show the truth to the world .
sergei , rest in peace .
bosa , run it once more .
what do you mean there's no body?
there were several powerful explosions , not from above .
he used dynamite , probably strapped to his body .
and this film is ruined .
well , i knew he was crazy .
carry on looking .
i'm sure you'll find something .
go on , don't stand around .
have you found something?
dule , listen to me .
this should be the last scene of a film you must shoot about djole , aca , me and our stupid lives .
you 've got everything ...
you 've got a protagonist , an antagonist , you 've got politics , war , and me as the victor who gets killed in front of cameras .
i hope these shits won 't be late .
