we'd like to take a look at his files .

of course , we have his main files .
it was your personals .
what do you want to know?
we'll have your bishop op reports downloaded ... and sorted in an hour or two ; for now , i'll just take your files .
grab yourself a seat and make yourself comfortable .
it's gonna take me a while to dig 'em up .
call my office as soon as you have 'em .
asap .
oh , muir?
good luck with the retirement .
the director sent this down .
actually , it looks like he signed it himself .
oh , and harker said i'm supposed to collect all your files on tom bishop .
finally get to use one of these burn bags .
hold this , till you hear otherwise .
you didn't see what i put in .
are we feeling a little paranoid on our last day?

before the rain .
hey , billy , you got my hundred?
harker said to bring this file up .
you want to buzz me through?
no , i can't , sir .
but i'll make sure he gets it .
sir?
can you get that chinese translator?
no , that looks pretty good .
looks good . ... as for the upcoming trade negotiations in the far east , a team of negotiators has been working with the chinese ... in an effort to streamline the proceedings ... and lay the ground work for the president's trip next week .
in other world news ...
jeez . now that the cold war is finally over , berliners are proclaiming a new era ... here where soviet and american tanks faced each other ... in the darkest days of the communist
is this it?
it's all i could find .
packed , misplaced you know how it is .
moving day and all .
it's probably mostly up here anyway .
old school , you know?
muir?
step this way?
sit down here , please , muir?
jesus , aiken .
how long has it been?
this task force have a name?
this isa tough one , troy .
i'm gonna see you later .
you got it , cy .
good to see you .
thanks for stoppin 'by .
for the record , we've been joined by nathan muir , near east ops .
we're in the process of dealing ... with a fairly specific ... international flap .
we brought you in here as a stop gap .
fill in a few holes for us .
so i'm like the little dutch boy , huh?
yeah !
we just need you to be a team player on this one , muir .
why is that funny?
every time my coach told me that , i knew i was about to get benched .
due to the nature of this task force , nathan , there will be certain information which you don't need to know .
a week ago , tom bishop disappeared in hong kong .
last night he turned up outside shanghai .
he's been arrested for espionage .
we're working up a profile based on relevant personal histories and op records .
this has to be handled with kid gloves .
how long does the president have to claim him?
twenty four hours .
starting when?
as of now , nathan .
bishop has been classified as a common criminal , and will be executed at 8 : 00 a. m. tomorrow morning , our time .
what about the press?
why not leak it and throw the spotlight on china , and buy us some time?
we need the press on this like we need a third teat .
you using the other two?
we don't want outside influences to ... limit our options .
what was bishop doing in china?
he was with an operation for harry duncan .
was?
yes .
until he took matters into his own hands .
well , where are they holding him?
oh , i'm sorry , nathan .
it would be nice to know what gaps are filled .
i've only got ten fingers here , you know?
i guess , kind of tough timing , hmm?
a week before the president's road trip .
you guys afraid there's gonna be a congressional hearing?
that's why we're transcribing and videotaping .
right?
are you gonna want me to testify?
no .
no?
absolutely not .
you met bishop in vietnam , right?
yeah .
spring of'75 .
hue had just fallen .
danang would go in a couple of days .
and i had flown in country to get an arvn sniper ... who'd been with us throughout the phoenix program .
he was a heavy hitter named binh .
spent the last year rocky mountain way
it's time to open fire
and we don't need the ladies

i volunteered , sir .
he came acrossas one of those idealistic types you know , a little bit of an attitude?
starts out trying to see what he's made of , and ends up not liking the view .
who was the target , muir?
general hun chea .
he's laotian?
yeah .
unofficial enemy .
red shirt .
he's responsible for the western flank of the upcoming saigon offensive .
his name don't need a name , sir .
you don't need it?
or you don't want it?
yeah , i'll do it , sir .
okay .
the target will be at a location ... twenty one clicks away , tomorrow morning at 0900 .
it's a high powered meet and greet with the vietcong .

hell of an ad for the boy scouts .
did you have a presidential finding authorizing those kills?
i don't believe we've met .
who are you?
dr. william byars .
national security council .
was there a finding , muir?
well , we were in a place we weren't supposed to be , assassinating a general from a country we weren't at war with of course , we weren't officially at war with north vietnam , either
is that a " no "?
oh , come on , guys .
we're on the clock .
the president admits bishop is ours , denies he's a spy , we put out the fires and negotiate a deal .
unless i'm missing something .
muir's secretary's on [ indistinct ]
mm .
this will just take a second .
stop recording .
stop tape .
your secretary's got your wife on the line .
she says it's urgent .
go ahead .
want to take it outside?
no , no .
i'll take it in here .
that's fine .
hello?
got your message .
you want me to start a fire yet?
oh , uh , right .
this'll just take a second .
right .
tell you what .
why don't you hold that reservation , and , uh , we may still be able to use it .
you might just .
as we speak , there are three guys rummaging ... through everything i spent a week packing .
uh huh .
okay .
uh huh .
if there were any instances of personal dysfunction , right . emotional or psychological , it could be helpful .
okay .
it's insubstantial .
right .
right .
mm hmm .
okay .
that'll be good .
because presidential findings ...
have no real importance .
you still there?
y yeah .
so he was an assassin , recruited to kill .
sounds good .
bye bye .
sorry .
wife planning a retirement dinner .
assassin?
i think i just figured it out .
the bishop files .
where?
my office .
closet .
it'll just take a second .
i'll send a security officer down .
no , hey , you guys ... have better things to do than to rummage through my office , right , chuck?
he's on his way down .
you were right .
it rained .
what about these?
burn 'em .
what is this about?
money .
free trade .
microchips .
toaster ovens .
and what does that have to do with you?
nothing .
get me digger gibson's number .
shit !
agency's looking for a reason to let the chinese kill tom bishop .
no !
ah , they shut down my secure line last day and all .
can i use yours?
thanks .
aw , well [ clears throat ]
oh , i'm sorry .
it's classified .
do you mind?
oh !
uh , right .
there's nothing there .
it's not in english?
it's not in english either .
this fax just came in a few moments ago , sir .
yeah .
so , sir , you and muir came up together , right?
mm .
how well do you know him?
no one knows nathan .
not really .
do you trust him?
he's a man who got the job done .
is he on the job now?
office of security , hong kong .
ten to seven this morning , a call originated from station to muir's home .
he knew about bishop before he got here .
and he played dumb .
yeah , this is harker .
i need confirmation on all calls ... in and out of nathan muir's office .
gee , i'm hungry .
hong kong herald .
digger gibson , please .
one moment , sir .
hello?
gibby , old boy .
nathan !
to what do i owe this honor?
still have contacts at cnn?
i got something for you .
talk to me .
how about " c. i. a. operative caught in the act ofespionage "?
can you get that on the air?
that's not gonna be easy .
come on , gibby .
that's never stopped you before .
give me 30 minutes .
yeah .
i remember seeing something about bishop in my south american box , but it wasn't there .
those op files downloaded yet?
let's go with this .
bishop's recruitment .
yeah .
well , back then , recruitment took time .
bishop was evacuated with the last of them on the 30th of april , and that gave me a month to do my homework .
i talked to his neighbors , his teachers , his mom scoutmaster
pulled his dad's records from the pentagon .
then started to move some pieces around on the board .
and my plan was to isolate and alienate .
your valleys and your farms
i had his c. o. give him just menial duties ... with non english speaking personnel .
and i kept him in limbo about even the possibility of going home .
and then i watched ... and waited .
this consignment is a complete misdirect .
it needs to go to military h. q in mannheim .
you understand?
fuck !
then , in december , when i didn't think he could take anymore ,
i made the move .
these mist covered mountains
are a home now to me
there she is .
but my home is the lowlands
uh , sorry sir .
it's bishop .
sergeant bishop?
oh , christ .
of course !
hi .
yeah , hi .
sandy , this is tom bishop .
tom , right?
yes , sir .
tom , sir .
tom .
how are you?
nice to meet you .
sandy?
my second wife .
second wife?
he asked me what i was doing in berlin , and i told him i was there as a military liaison of a sort .
it's good to hear an american voice again , i'll tell you that .
i'll bet , i'll bet .
what are you doing for christmas?
no plans .
oh , the weather outside is frightful
but the fire is so delightful
central intelligence?
train you as an agent .
you'd be working for me .
mostly undercover .
europe?
wherever the action is .
what if i preferred ... to just go home?
that's okay .
it's fine .
i can probably make arrangements for you to end your tour of duty in san diego .
in which case , i'll presume you'll forget we ever had this conversation .
but look , it's your choice .
all the way home i'll be warm [ chuckles softly ]
the next day , we started his tradecraft .
the technology gets better every day , and that's fine .
but most of the time , all you need is a stick of gum , a pocket knife and a smile .
that's disappointing .
guten morgen , meine herren .
today we're going to be discussing a radio set .
not just any radio set , but a russian radio set .
every building , every room , every situation is a snapshot .
while i'm sitting here talking to you , i'm also checking the room , memorizing it .
the people .
what they're wearing .
then i ask the question ,
what's wrong with this picture?
anything suspect?
you've gotta see it , assess it and dismiss most of it ...
without looking , without thinking .
without thinking?
it's just like breathing .
you breathe , don't you?
always carry cigarettes and a lighter too .
great ice breaker .
eine kaffee , bitte .
zwei .
okay , i want you to listen , but i want your concentration to be on something different .
anything else , so you don't react .
understand?
yes .
so when do i get my first assignment?
when i decide you're ready .
what is your name?
michael sandville .
the suit in the kitchen .
threat?
wait , how'd you see that?
ah !
see that apartment building?
yeah?
know anyone who lives there?
no .
within five minutes , i want to see you standing on one of those balconies .
come on .
did you serve in vietnam?
no , i did not .
favorite color?
why don't we discuss it over coffee?
you just lost ten seconds .
solicit information from someone .
gladly .
the guy reading the menu .
don't look at him .
he wasn 't reading the menu .
he's not reading at all .
threat?
only to the hostess .
you just gave her four pieces of personal information ... for one dubious , impersonal fact .
just trying to find out where she got that dress .
where are you from?
when's your birthday?
you know everything about me .
i don't know a thing about you .
okay , what did you tell her?
one , you're straight .
two , you're engaged .
three , tomorrow's your girl's birthday , and four , you have no taste in women's fashions .
what if she were an asset?
you told her four lies that now have to be true .
okay .
i thought spies drank martinis .
scotch , never less than 12 years old .
is that right?
agency rules?
my rules .
all right , so what else?
what else do i need to know?
put away some money so you can die someplace warm .
don't ever touch it .
not for anyone .
ever .
okay .
is that it?
don't ever risk your life or your career for an asset .
if it comes down to you or them , send flowers .
he was a natural .
he could take an east german who had just come over the wall ,
look him straight in the eye , and ask him to go back ... to the place he just fled and spy for us .
he got so good at it he could close in a single afternoon , send the guy out with a smile .
let me get this straight : you allowed a contract agent to develop assets?
he was that good .
i thought he'd make a fine case officer someday .
let's get on with it .
i'd like to hear whatever you can offer about ...
operation rodeo .
rodeo?
the cathcart affair?
hold transcription , hold tape .
i'll be right back .
you know , this would go a lot faster , you guys , if you'd tell me a little something about the op .
what's it called?
sideshow?
what about it?
how'd you come by this information?
just stuff we learn in the field .
sorry about that .
okay , where were we?
i think we were talking about ...
operation rodeo right , chuck?
you're on .
my east german contacts ... discovered that we had an unidentified mole in the embassy .
we had the ambassador in our crosshairs , until some information leaked when he was out of the country .
so that just left one possibility .
ah , ann .
hello .
ann  ... cathcart .
yeah .
bishop was involved in a small but integral part of the operation going east to bring across an east german functionary named schmidt .
ready?
yeah .
ah , fuck !
the passport's in the glove box .
there's some vodka .
spill it on your coat .
if they stop us , don't say a word .
remember , you're drunk .
and where is mrs. muir?
patricia left me and filed for divorce .
oh , i'm so sorry , nathan .
how is it i always say the wrong things?
patricia?
yeah , my third wife .
my god , how many wives have you had?
four .
you want to hear about them , or bishop?
you see that gentleman?
yeah?
he's the ambassador .
why don't you go over there and say hello to him?
okay .
okay?
your scotch is older than she is .
am i supposed to feel bad about that?
they know .
they have my family already , i know it .
if they knew , they would have stopped us .
tomorrow , your wife , your kids , will all be safe in munich .
i gotta make a stop .
what?
it's a scheduled stop .
i gotta make a phone call .
they follow you .
friedrich , it's all taken care of , okay?
if they ask , tell 'em i got sick .
why don't we go outside?
i'm sure we won't be missed .
i wish i could .
i have to stay near the phone .
working on a saturday night?
are you bringing someone across?
bitte .
yes?
vodka did me in .
i'm comin 'home .
throw out the bottle .
repeat that?
throw out the bottle .
they know .
they don't know .
they don't fuckin 'know .
they'll be waiting .
drop as close to checkpoint as possible .
negative , we're comin 'across .
no .
that's an order .
let him go .
they will kill him .
change of plans , friedrich .
no .
you will drive me across , just as you said .
if i do that , they'll kill us both .
this way , we still have a chance .
you're a liar .
this way , you still have a chance .
i can't help you .
just get out of the car .
i will not get out .
get out ofthe car !
get out !
i will not get out !
i will not !
no !
no !
no !
no !
get out .
get out !
please .
my wife .
my children .
i can't help you !
nathan , what happened?
what went wrong?
nothing .
nothing?
actually , one thing .
don't ever question me again .
ever .
what?
i gave you an order , you take it .
you don't ask why .
those ten seconds on the phone could have blown the op .
the op was bringing schmidt across !
the op was setting up ann cathcart .
and your end had to look legit .
what are you telling me?
schmidt was bait?
yes .
nathan , they executed him on a shitty cellar floor !
it could have been you .
let me tell you something about schmidt .
he went to the russians a week ago , and said he had a contact , an american .
somebody he could use .
don't tell me that .
you didn't look in his eyes .
don't tell me that !
he was your asset .
somebody you used for information .
aw , jesus christ !
you don't just trade these people like they're baseball cards .
it's not a fuckin 'game !
oh , yes , it is .
that's exactly what it is .
and it's no kid's game , either .
this is a whole other game .
and it's serious and it's dangerous and it's not one you want to lose .
nathan , we killed this man .
we used him , and we killed him .
okay , then you gotta help me understand this one .
you nathan , what are we doin 'here?
don't give me some bullshit about the greater good .
that's exactly what it's about .
because what we do is unfortunately very , very necessary .
and if you're not willing to sacrifice scum like schmidt ... for those that want nothing more than their freedom , then you better take a hard look at your profession , my friend .
because it doesn't get any easier .
why did you use me?
do you want to walk?
walk .
you should have told me about the op .
you used me .
i did .
and listen to this , because this is important .
if you had pulled some stunt over there ,
i wouldn't come after you .
you go off the reservation , i will not come after you .
fuck your rules , nathan .
okay .
but tonight , they saved your life .
can we have the relevant files on ann cathcart?
ann cathcart's body was found ... in the lobby of a cheap hotel in east germany , just two months after she defected .
yeah .
beaten to death .
vopos never solved the case .
and bishop was in berlin when this happened .
we were both in berlin do you recall bishop's reaction ... to the news that ann cathcart was dead?
motive and opportunity .
nathan , you should leave here knowing that we're looking into every possible scenario .
what's " sideshow "?
you don't need to know .
why are you trying to burn bishop?
troy?
hold transcription , hold video .
sideshow was a bugging op .
listening to government offices in eastern china .
the trade talks?
mm .
and you're afraid the lid to the cookie jar is gonna slam shut on our hand?
oh , come on , guys !
chinese need trade status more than we need to give it .
that's not necessarily so .
twenty four hours after capture , bishop's allowed to start talking .
that gives you , what?
ten , twelve hours to make a trade .
come on .
you're on the clock .
he doesn't know anything .
bishop wasn't on sideshow .
he wasn't working for us .
he was arrested during a rescue attempt ... at a prison outside su chou .
who was he after?
don't know .
let go of me !
for more on this late breaking story , we go live to hong kong .
it has been confirmed that the chinese claim ... to have arrested an american operative for the c. i. a.
while the state department remains quiet , official sources say that the individual , working out of american consulate in hong kong , was captured in an act of espionage .
if confirmed , this comes at a bad time for an administration ... which is in the middle of trade negotiations with china .
the u. s. government is in the process of negotiating his release .
the embassy promised to keep us a breast ...
we are so fucked . of the situation as it develops .
this is frank nall , live in hong kong .
guess that limits our options .
i want to know what you have to say about this , and i want it on the record .
when i was a kid , i used to spend summers on my uncle's farm .
and he had this plow horse that he used to work with every day .
he really loved that plow horse .
one summer she came up lame , and could barely stand .
the vet offered to put her down .
you know what my uncle said?
no , muir .
what did he say?
he said , " why would i ask somebody else to kill a horse that belonged to me?
get me peter brody at the fcc .
i don't care .
just get him .
looks like bishop's gonna be okay .
good .
what about the flag?
keep it .
something to remember me by .
you know where to store this stuff , right?
yeah .
what do i do with the storage key?
if i need it , i'll send for it .
i'll send you a postcard .
from where?
not a chance .
you'd show up and try to clean the place , and scare the native girls away .
i wish .
i'll be working for andy unger down the hall .
you're gonna miss it .
you know that , don't you?
thank you .
thank you .
mm hmm .
have a nice day .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
mm hmm .
thank you .
for more on this story , we go live to hong kong .
and , in a late breaking development of the incident reported earlier , rumors that tom bishop , an alleged c. i. a. operative , had been captured in an act of espionage , now appears to be a hoax .
tom bishop died 14 months ago .
while the c. i. a. has made no official comment , sources close to the agency have confirmed bishop's death late last year .
the discredited story has been attributed ... to an overzealous member of the chinese government , who leaked the false information in the hopes of undermining the current u. s. trade negotiations .
this is frank nall , live in hong kong .
mr. muir?
told you you'd miss it .
who do you trust in military intelligence?
i co signed martha rayburn's car loan .
listen , gladys .
i gotta buy some time here .
i'm gonna need imagery analysis fora military prison near su chou .
and if you use the phones , don't use these .
any chance i could lose my job over this?
good .
i didn't want to work for andy unger anyway .
i know who it is .
i know who bishop was after .
well , so do we .
but do you know why?
i mean , if anybody knew the back story ,
i mean , it would , well , uh ,
it's just that it would make a congressional hearing really worth watching .
by the way , that's not in the op reports .
muir , you're not cleared to be in here .
relax , kappler .
if i didn't have clearance , how did i get in?
where's this report?
i just came from the seventh floor , and there's some people pretty disappointed it hasn't arrived yet .
hold on !
what report?
you were at the briefing .
i'm talking about tom bishop .
bishop went rogue .
yeah , and they were gonna ... pull him out until somebody up there and i'm not gonna say who said that your department claimed there weren't enough resources .
who said that?
look , i can buy some time while you pull this together .
now , operation sideshow .
that's near the prison , right?
near su chou .
china .
come on .
any air support?
oh .
shit , that's probably folger .
yup .
p'eng hu islands .
commander wiley's outfit .
