when i was born my parents felt they had won the lottery .
but they didn't know me yet .
they weren't as pleased later on .
especially not dad .
he likes me , but i think he'd rather have a more normal boy .
the kind that plays soccer instead of the piano .
then he might not have left , and mom wouldn't be so lonely .
martin !
mom says dad's taking a time out .
it might be cold up north .
i guess he's trying to figure out what to do about us .
i could stay home ...
or maybe dad could come here , so you could see him too .
no ...
sometimes i wish i was someone else , someone more outspoken .
i'm julia .
from day one l knew i had a lousy deal .
they weren't were wild about me either , though mom pretended to be .
a kaleidoscope !
then she met this new guy , who had a daughter , so she didn't need me .
but who cares , i don't need her either .
julia !
no way i'm going to visit that bitch !
this weekend is special for your mother ... and that peter guy .
even though things were rough last christmas , you can't just give up .
and that daughter of his , what's her name ...?
my , that's it .
you'll practically be sisters .
i don't want to have a sister !
i want to have a dog !
that's nasty ...
i don't like traveling but until dad's made his mind up , what can i do?
go figure ...
mom gets herself a new family but i get passed around like some kind of parcel !
i should go get myself a whole new family too .
a whole new family ...
here , take this mobile phone .
how can parents let their kids use mobile phones and fry their brains?
it's not like i enjoy sending my only child off to a strange man's house .
i do it for you , so you can interact with both your parents even if one is ... absent .
will you tape robert wells tonight?
sure .
but doesn't your dad have a tv set too?
it's time to go !
i really don't want to do this .
have a good time ...
i'm not going , and that's final .
let go !
can't you come along?
you know i can't .
i'll see you soon , honey .
here we are .
you're martin , right?
i'll come and get you when it's time to board the plane .
thank you ...
why did you say thank you?
you thanked that lady .
it's their job to take care of us .
you don't need to thank them .
where are you going?
up north , to see my dad .
he lives close to the norwegian border .
what about you?
i'm going south , to see my mom .
do you go there a lot?
i've only been there once since ... ... since she ... moved out .
she's got a new boyfriend .
what about you?
my mother's not ready for a new relationship .
i meant , how often do you visit your dad?
every four weeks and every other holiday , only ...
you don't want to .
i wish dad would come back home .
so mom wouldn't be sad all the time .
want one?
no , i'm a vegetarian .
i don't eat dead animals .
got any money?
160 kronor .
and ten norwegian kronor .
why do norwegians water flag poles?
don't know .
they want the bulb on top to bloom .
want to go buy something?
i'm not supposed to go anywhere .
do you have a best friend?
nah , that's just silly .
i agree .
check it out !
come on in !
that's london .
robert wells played there , at the royal albert hall .
who?
robert wells .
some day i'm going to play there too .
maybe we're twins .
we don't have the same parents .
we're cosmic twins .
what's that?
pieces of the same whole , like broken bits of glass that fit together .
broken bits of glass?
just something i heard somewhere .
let me try these ...
wow , what a trip ...
give them back ...
try this on .
want to trade places?
if we trade places we get out of seeing our parents .
martin , where did you go off to?
your flight's ready for take off , we don't wait for little kids you know .
excuse me ...
could you help me out?
julia , it's time to go .
julia?
welcome aboard .
hurry up , honey .
this isn't the right plane , i'm going to see my dad .
i'm supposed to go to norrland .
may we have your attention please as we demonstrate our safety procedures .
this information is also available in the folder in your seat pocket .
emergency exits are located in the back , over the wings , and up front .
a light strip along the floor will direct you to the way out .
please check which exit is the closest to your seat .
come on , martin !
how about some adventure?
i don't know ...
is it true that you're a wimp?
well , are you a wimp?
no .
then go for it !
discover new frontiers .
show people what you're made of !
good , it's about time you showed some spunk .
let's hear it for martin !
we would like to remind you that smoking is prohibited .
and we'd like to wish you a pleasant trip .
where could that dad of yours be?
i don't know .
i hope your mother told your dad when your flight would be in .
what's his phone number?
i don't know .
you don't know?
i've forgotten it .
is that your dad?
well?
martin !
i'm so sorry ...
thank you , i apologize for the delay .
i was busy breeding .
bye .
look at you ...
does robert wells have a new hairdresser?
wow , muscles ...
have you been working out?
how's school?
fine .
and your classmates?
everything's fine .
great .
good .
sverker will be surprised .
he thinks all you do is sit still and play the piano .
i can't sit still , and i don't play the piano either .
have you quit playing?
not really ...
but i'm trying to cut back .
i see ...
but you will play for us at the party , won't you?
gran's birthday party .
oh , that party ...
gran's really looking forward to it .
as you can see , it's still a bit cold up here .
but down south in malm they're already wearing swim trunks .
julia !
kicki wanted me to pick you up .
i know you're a tough cookie ... ... but you'll find i'm a worthy opponent .
good , then we won't have a repeat of the christmas incident .
you've changed .
yeah , my hair is nicer .
what do your friends say?
tell me .
they don't say much ...
your stepfather is a world famous gladiator , of course you've bragged about it .
be like pollux : big , bad and beautiful !
the gladiators , on tv .
don't you watch the show?
no , mom ...
mom doesn't like shows like that .
are you nuts?
she yells her head off cheering .
you'll see , tonight .
listen , don't give my a hard time .
get in the back .
hi ...
my !
hop in .
i don't usually sit in the front seat .
funny ...
i'm so glad you're here .
i've missed you like crazy .
you have?
of course i have .
pop upstairs and say hi to your gran , i'll start cooking dinner .
i'll take your jacket .
martin ... is that nail polish?
isn't it neat?
it might not go down well here ...
i'll take it off if you want me to .
long hair is one thing ...
but some folks might think nail polish is strange .
all the guys wear nail polish in stockholm .
people would think it was strange if you didn't .
i see ...
i don't want you to get in trouble .
why would l?
martin , is that you?
wait here in the car .
knock it off .
what?
you are so busted .
it wasn't my idea ...
it's not my fault your parents got divorced .
i know that .
you do?
you told me you'd still have a mom if it wasn't for me .
did i say that?
and you said you'd cut my hair off when i was asleep .
oh ... that was a rotten thing to say .
you should have seen the way the shop girls stared at me .
their eyes were like this .
excuse me !
i knew it .
right , do you have a pen?
i can't sign autographs without a pen .
you forgot your change .
oh ...
thanks .
people are always asking dad for his autograph .
and he came to my school and showed everyone his muscles .
why?
everyone wanted to see them .
hi ...
you've changed .
thanks .
come on in .
what do you think?
pretty .
but the shoes are a pain , i can barely walk in them .
they set off your legs , kicki .
and no one's got legs like yours !
go and unpack , you can try on your dresses later .
stay out of my room !
sorry , i'll go to my room ...
i need to freshen up .
flying leaves you all grimy .
those pigs are the cutest !
i wish i could have one as a pet .
what's that?
a cream sauce .
it's very rich , so don't tell your mom i'm feeding you stuff like that .
about your mom ...
does anyone come around to see her?
in the evenings ...
guys that come to date ...
she's not ready for a new relationship .
i'm sorry , i shouldn't have asked you that .
but that's just what she says .
some people meet someone when they walk into a 7 eleven store .
has your mom ...?
no , not her .
other people .
oh ...
could you tell gran that dinner's ready?
gran ...
dinner's ready .
who are you?
where's martin?
are you coming?
who is this little girl , torkel?
mother ....
it's martin .
that is not martin .
stop it , mother .
dinner's ready , come down when you're ready .
i don't eat meat .
since when?
since ...
thursday .
i told you it's not martin .
stop it , mother .
may i come in?
have you seen ... the room?
we weren't sure ...
after what happened at christmas we weren't sure you'd be here much , and peter needed some space .
so we packed away your things .
but they're in the boxes .
we really want to see you , and you do have a room at your dad's place .
is his computer still in there?
you should tell him to throw it out .
your room isn't a junkyard , you tell him i said that .
take your time and unpack your things .
you can try your dress on later .
right ...
i'm just going to work out a little .
your mother is lucky in love , that's for sure .
let's speed things up ...
no ... that was a little too fast .
set it for ten .
aren't they gorgeous?
this one's yours , julia .
this is what we'll look like .
i don't usually wear dresses .
i know ...
that's why i was so happy that you agreed to wear one on this special and wonderful day .
what's this?
strange ...
you seem to have gotten smaller .
doesn't your dad feed you?
sure , he serves lots of pork .
you don't eat meat .
that's right , i forgot that she ... ... that i'm a vegrarian .
maybe i should wear something else?
no , i can fix it .
i really appreciate that you've started combing your hair again .
here they come , martin .
who?
hello , torkel .
good to see you .
how was the trip?
a bloody nightmare !
where's ma?
i'm worried about her .
she didn't recognize martin .
she didn't?
hi there , you poor little thing .
mother's resting .
well if it isn't martin , the piano mistress .
are they still mean to you at school?
i've got even more super powers .
i can move myself with my mind .
it's true , i'll show you later .
joakim could teach those stockholmers a thing or two .
he never says no to a fight .
hello , joakim .
show uncle torkel how good you are .
up with the left ...
come on , show him .
not bad .
he's good .
what are you doing with that?
are you going to sleep in here?
got something against it?
it sounds like fun .
you like norwegian jokes?
you know , the kind that poke fun at norwegians .
i know loads .
that's news to me .
want to hear one?
know why jesus wasn't born in norway?
they couldn't find three wise men .
want to hear another one?
know any dirty jokes?
do you know the difference between a mailbox and a horse's ass?
then we can't send you to mail letters .
you've grown up .
you think so?
you used to be like a girl .
excuse me , is it all right if i turn on the tv?
go ahead .
oh my god , it's eight !
peter !
my !
are you coming?
welcome to the gladiators !
featuring pollux !
what a cool dude !
pollux he's big , bad and beautiful !
he really cleaned up last week ...
what am i doing here?
i don't want to be here .
why don't you do something about it?
aren't you on tv?
take charge of your life , martin .
it's not easy .
sometimes you have to do hard stuff .
follow your heart , martin .
i don't know what that means , or what to listen for .
well , you can hear me .
are you the voice of my heart?
now you see me , but before you know it , i will be transported ...
... without moving a muscle .
fat chance !
are you still here?
how are you , ma?
hello .
hello ...
martin ... it's martin !
it's for me ...
i have this friend in malm called martin .
are you out of your mind?
you can't call me here .
i've decided to follow my heart and tell the truth .
what?
speak up , closer to the phone .
these people are nuts and they're making me wear a dress .
say no , i would .
then come here and say it .
i'm not staying .
we agreed to trade places .
i didn't agree .
you said you didn't want to go .
i said i wanted my dad to come home .
i might be able to help you .
torkel's been asking if your mother is seeing someone .
that means he's jealous .
he might be thinking about coming home .
let's wait until tomorrow and i'll find out what he's up to .
i don't want to spend the night here !
how are you ever going to reach london if you can't even go to malm?
by the way , your cousin's cute .
jonathan?
oh no , not joakim ...
if he tries to take grandpa's moped again , you've got to stop him .
okay , it's your turn .
i didn't know you could drive .
you don't know me very well .
want to go into town and check out the chicks?
don't you know what chicks are?
or would you rather practice piano?
then hop on .
hold on .
maybe there aren't any chicks around here .
look !
now don't make a fool of yourself .
hi there .
don't you recognize us?
unfortunately , we do .
is it all right if i pet your dog?
go ahead .
what's his name?
rhonda , she's a girl .
it's hard to tell the difference .
i know .
what's up?
want to have a ride?
on that?
is it fun to have a dog?
not if you have to walk it a lot .
we could come along .
or we could walk rhonda .
wait !
what a cutie !
well , i think you're cute .
really cute .
are you going to bed?
yeah .
me too .
oh ...
you're so different .
compared to what you were like last christmas .
i never thought you'd wear a dress .
neither did i.
you looked nice in it .
really?
it was a little big , though .
yeah ...
you know what?
as of tomorrow , we'll be family .
is that good or bad?
i just wanted to say goodnight .
the kaleidoscope ...
i thought you threw it away?
why did you say you threw it away?
i don't know .
funny how broken bits of glass can be so pretty ...
and if two pieces of glass fit together ...
then maybe they're ...
... cosmic twins !
you still remember that nonsense , do you?
it's not nonsense , it's true !
julia ...
my julia .
i love you so much .
good night .
good night .
listen ... about the dress ...
i know you don't really like dresses .
it's actually kind of pretty .
will you wear it?
29 ...
and one for ma ... ... and one for pa .
good morning .
two more , and that's it .
it's awful , but i haven't been able to sleep .
i'm so darned nervous .
but a tough cookie like you wouldn't understand that .
i would too ...
i know i shouldn't worry .
but i have this funny feeling something will go wrong .
gran says that a troubled soul is a living soul .
right ...
want to try some?
it's an energy drink .
sometimes you need a boost ...
want to give it a go?
no ...
come on , girlie .
give it a whirl .
you sit there and put your feet up there .
whoops , that was too much ...
i'll lose a couple more .
good .
good job , one more ...
come on !
come meet ...
rosa ... ... and linda .
we work together at salon rosalinda !
on monday they leave for the barrier reef , their honeymoon .
that's in australia , you know .
won't that be fun?
they're not taking me .
don't you know what grown ups do on a honeymoon?
they mess around !
no peeking !
i need to take a leak .
go outside , this place is a ladies 'room only today .
but it's my regular week to be with mom anyway .
actually , this week was mom's week , only they switched .
it makes you wonder if they would do the same for us , move around , i mean .
i think my mother would like to have me all the time .
now it's your turn , girls .
exciting , isn't it?
that your mom is getting married?
i don't think so , i think she misses dad too much .
oh ...
has she told you that?
no , mom always says everything's fine even when it isn't .
let's see what we can do ...
oh , not ...
martin's wearing girlie underwear !
check it out !
yuck !
i knew there was something wrong with him !
dad !
could i do my vanishing trick at the party?
what a nut you are .
something's wrong with martin .
to say the least ...
if my son wore floral panties , i'd send him to military school .
he'd have no say in the matter , and how fair would that be?
well if it isn't the piano mistress .
i'm not a mistress ...
that's not what i hear .
i hear you're pretty girlie girlie .
what the hell are you doing?
let's go fix dinner , martin .
does it hurt?
of course not ...
i dislike violence , but it was about time someone taught him a lesson .
why haven't you done it?
he's always been like that .
listen , there's something i've got to tell you .
you see , i'm going to move out at the end of the month .
was that why you asked about mom?
i want her to be okay with this .
i'm sure she'll be glad .
i want you to be glad too .
see ...
i've met someone i like .
dinner , coming up !
her name is eva karin ...
martin !
i should have told you ...
it's disgusting !
all you think of is your own pleasure even if means death !
does it seem that bad to you?
i never wanted to hurt anyone ...
what do you use for brains? !
i want you to be okay with this , that's the most important thing .
i'll never do something like this again without talking to you first .
promise?
i promise .
what about the dinner?
it's too late to make any changes at this point , but if you give me the chance
i'll tell eva karin how you feel .
eva karin?
what about the pigs?
the pigs?
what are you doing here in the dark?
the guests are arriving .
don't be afraid , he's promised to talk to me beforehand .
and i'll never , ever let you die !
welcome !
please have a drink .
everyone at twilight cottage wishes you a happy birthday !
for me?
evert and anna mrta chipped in .
but not ke and mrs. lsaksson .
you can have two sets of china .
is my hearing aid ringing?
this is martin and eva karin .
all the grandchildren are here .
it would have been nice if martin were here .
he promised to play for us .
martin will play for you .
i can assure you he will .
let's go inside .
is it hard to walk with those sticks?
yes , it's very difficult .
i can carry them for you , i'm really strong !
we will be hearing ...
what?
i think i'll improvise .
the boy's improved .
don't waste our time ...
he might not feel like playing .
considering ...
this family loves music .
right?
we love music .
i wish i could play .
so , go ahead .
do this .
and you do this .
any more music lovers?
how is everything?
your dad is moving back in .
really?
at the end of the month .
thanks for helping me out .
you're helping me .
go , you're free !
what are you , stupid?
you can't trust a guy like that !
save yourselves , run !
all right ...
if you'd rather be christmas dinner , suit yourselves !
i certainly do ...
i do ...
i do .
i do .
oh , kicki !
i don't have the words ...
your waist is like a wasp .
your hair is like a wedding cake .
and those legs ... ... are divine !
you look good too .
so do you .
could you pull over?
i need to pee .
why didn't you go before we left?
well she didn't , so stop the car .
i don't get it , she spent all day in the ladies 'room , and all ...
i've got to go too .
again?
see ...
wait , julia ... ... or whatever your name is , wait !
where is julia?
in renvattnet .
up north , by the norwegian border .
everything fine?
yeah .
need to make a call?
you can borrow my phone .
but only if you look after rhonda for a while .
the bride's a knock out .
welcome to the church .
i'm peter .
aren't you ...?
you're pollux , right?
i always root for you .
thank you .
come along , kids .
how are you doing?
i'm fine .
you know ...
a troubled soul is a living soul .
i guess we won't be related after all .
is that good or bad?
what do you think?
let's go upstairs to the gallery .
hello !
come here .
look at all those people .
i don't see well at a distance .
i usually wear glasses .
i'll help you out .
here come our neighbors .
dad says they're filthy rich .
and those guys work with dad .
rosa and linda are over there .
hello !
forget everything i told you , he's just like the rest .
what do you mean?
he's met someone !
but what about mom?
all he cares about is himself .
just like my mom , who doesn't care about me or anyone else .
that's not true , kicki loves you .
when did she say that?
yesterday .
she said it to you .
yes ...
then it's you she loves .
she thought i was you .
but it wasn't me .
this just isn't working out !
i've looked all over for you .
how long were you on the phone?
i'll pay for it .
that's all right , he took care of rhonda for me .
bye , martin !
you can watch rhonda anytime .
what did she say?
she told me ... that things weren't the way i thought they were .
dad's met someone .
so?
you didn't expect him to move back in with your mom , did you?
are you going to tell kicki?
i have to .
it's your call , just listen to your heart .
robert ...?
robert wells .
how could you be so careless?
you know it's a rare antique .
i thought it was a moped .
rare means valuable and special ...
just like you .
i wish you would tell me what's wrong .
then maybe we could start trusting each other again .
where's my old martin?
doesn't that look scrumptious !
no , i think it looks tasty .
i'm not martin .
i already know that .
i'm julia .
it's time .
you look great .
are you ready , my?
go get julia .
hurry up .
give me a kiss .
come on .
come on , julia .
hurry up .
we make our entrance when the bells stop ringing .
what's the matter?
i have to talk to you , kicki .
it's not a good time .
right now .
let go of me ...
what is it , julia?
i'm not julia .
that's not funny !
she's got cold feet , she's going back to her ex .
i can sense it .
no , kicki would never do that .
i know it's hard to understand ...
but it's like those pieces of glass in a kaleidoscope , two identical pieces lock into place .
that's impossible .
that's what happened .
but ...
why?
she traded me and my dad for a new guy and a new kid .
a kid with pretty hair .
your hair is pretty too , but it wouldn't hurt to comb it .
may l?
mom said she wanted to live on her own .
but then she met this new guy right away at a 7 eleven store .
he has a daughter , so she doesn't need me anymore .
and now they're getting married .
i told you so .
peter " pollux " bergvall ... ... and kristina linnea lindstrm .
we are gathered here to bless this union ...
i'm sorry ...
i can't go through with this .
not without julia .
well?
what are you doing?
what's your dad's number?
what's going on?
peter , please .
does this have anything to do with anders?
what's this , peas?
don't you want to be big and strong?
peas are good for you .
is pig farming profitable?
how are you doing?
i'm worried about martin .
if he was my son , i'd send ...
that's it , i've had enough !
i'm sick and tired of being bullied by you all my life !
i'll have you know that i'm proud of martin just the way he is !
i was going to say i'd send him to a music academy .
could you put julia on?
who is this?
put julia on !
what are you talking about?
let my daughter go !
i don't have your daughter .
dad , it's me , martin .
i'm sorry .
but ...
it's all my fault .
no , it isn't , martin .
and it's not julia's fault either .
it's all my fault .
but i've realized one thing ...
you can't run away from who you are .
you taught me that , martin .
we might as well get used to it .
goodbye .
it was fun , wasn't it , ma?
goodbye , bodil .
take care .
i was wondering ...
would you like to be my girlfriend?
you wouldn't even talk to me a few hours ago .
now you're a girl .
i'm still the same person .
bye , joakim .
look at me !
where did you come from?
bye , jonathan .
i've booked the first flight out to stockholm tomorrow , and so have they .
do you think she'll want to see me?
i can assure you she will .
how about it , toots?
want to go fishing?
you're not like other guys .
that's what they tell me .
you're so brave .
i'm not exactly a gladiator .
no , but you speak your mind .
you're brave for real .
how did it go , martin?
did you have an adventure?
good .
here ...
hi , dad .
hi , martin .
i'm so happy ...
me too .
boy , you've changed !
don't say that .
no , you haven't changed a bit .
so you're a newlywed , i guess .
no ...
i couldn't go through with it .
not without julia .
so it's up to me?
yeah ...
if i do it , what's in it for me?
you can ...
you can have a ...
a dog?
don't worry , dad , i don't need a dog , but then again ...
come , let's play together .
you're doing fine without me .
please , just for the heck of it?
so , you're going to renvattnet .
and then to malm .
i'll be back .
uh ...
thanks .
