curtain's going up !
a big broadway opening .
everybody who's anybody in new york is here tonight .
everybody but one man .
this man .
me .
where are you going?
didn't you direct this?
i just have to ...
one or two things .
get out of this theatre !
is anything wrong with your seat?
it's facing the stage !
it's going to be a disaster .
i can't just sit there and watch .
five seconds and we still haven't got a laugh .
i'm not running away .
i just don't like watching a car crash .
particularly when it's mine .
it's going to be a catastrophe .
they'll forget their lines .
we won't get out of new york alive .
there's pictures of us in the lobby .
i'll get on a plane .
i should have done when we opened in des moines , before we opened , at the dress rehearsal , as soon as the curtain went up .
as soon as the damned phone rang and dotty came on with the sardines .
hold on !
hold your horses !
oh , lord love a duck !
shut up !
i'm on my way .
it's no good you going on .
i can't open sardines and answer the phone .
i've only got one pair of feet .
hello?
yes , but there's no one here , love ...
no , mr brent's not here .
he lives here , yes , but not now because he lives in spain .
yes , philip brent , who writes plays , only now he writes them in spain .
she's in spain , too .
they all are .
am i in spain?
no , i'm not in spain .
i look after the house for them .
only i go home at one on wednesdays , so that's where i am .
no , because i've got a nice plate of sardines to put my feet up with .
and they've got colour here , and it's the royal ... you know , the horse race .
where's the paper?
if it's about letting the house , you'll have to ring the house agents .
squire , squire , hackham and ...
who's the other one?
no , they're next to the phone in the study .
squire , squire , hackham and ...
hold on !
i'll go and look .
as soon as you take the weight off your feet , down it all comes on your head .
and i take the sardines ...
no , i leave the sardines ...
no , i take the sardines .
you leave the sardines and you hang up the phone .
yes , right .
i hang up the phone .
and you leave the sardines .
i leave the sardines?
you leave the sardines .
i hang up the phone and i leave the sardines?
right !
we've changed that , have we , dear?
no , dear .
that's what i've always been doing?
i wouldn't say that , dotty .
how about the words?
am i getting some of them right?
some of them have a very familiar ring .
it's like a slot machine up here .
i know that .
i never know what's going to come out : three oranges or two lemons and a banana .
anyway , it's not midnight yet , and we don't open till tomorrow .
you're holding the receiver .
right .
squire , squire , hackham and ... hold on ! " and noises off .
squire , squire , hackham ...
hold on !
hanging up the phone .
put your feet up for two minutes and they come running after you .
hold it !
this is her afternoon off .
hold it , garry .
dotty !
we've got the place to ourselves .
wow !
hold it , brooke .
dotty !
come back?
yes , and go out with the newspaper .
the newspaper .
oh , the newspaper .
hang up the phone , leave the sardines and go out , with the newspaper .
here .
sorry .
don't worry .
it's just the tech .
it's the dress , garry .
when was the tech?
when's the dress?
we open tomorrow .
we're thinking of it as the tech .
it's the words .
don't worry about the words .
and that accent .
it's like oranges and lemons .
your words are fine .
better than the ... you know?
isn't that right?
sorry?
i mean , ok , he's the ...
but , dotty , you've been playing this kind of part for , well , i mean ...
jesus , dotty , you know?
garry and brooke are off , dotty is holding the receiver .
we open tomorrow , we've only had two weeks rehearsal , we don't know where we are , but here we are .
right , lloyd?
beautifully put .
we're playing des moines , then pittsburgh , then god knows where and we're all feeling , you know?
aren't you?
sorry?
garry , you're off .
sorry , lloyd , but ... you know?
i know .
thanks , lloyd .
so you're off ...
lloyd , let me just say one thing .
i've known many directors , some geniuses , some bastards , but i've never met one who was so totally ... i don't know .
thank you , garry , i'm very touched .
now get off the fucking stage .
and brooke?
yes?
are you in?
in?
are you there?
what?
you're out .
ok , i'll call again .
and on we go .
so , there you are , holding the receiver .
i hold the receiver .
i hang it up .
i leave the sardines .
always the same story ...
and you take the newspaper .
i take the newspaper .
i leave the sardines .
a weight off your mind , a load off your stomach .
and off i go at last .
leaving the receiver .
my housekeeper , yes , but ...
and noises off .
stage !
this is her afternoon off , so we've got the place to ourselves .
wow !
i'll just check .
hello?
anyone at home?
there's no one here .
what do you think?
great !
it's all yours?
just a shack in the woods .
converted mill , 1 6th century .
must have cost a bomb .
ideal for business .
someone's coming at 4 . 00 .
arab .
oil .
i've got to get those files to basingstoke by 4 . 00 .
we'll just manage to fit it in ...
do it ...
right .
we won't chill the champagne .
all these doors !
just a handful .
study , kitchen and housekeeper's flat .
which one's the ... you know?
oh , through here .
fantastic !
now i've lost the sardines .
i thought no one was here .
i'm not .
only it's the royal ...
the race where they wear those hats .
who are you?
from squire , squire , hackham and dudley .
which one are you , then?
i'm tramplemain .
i thought you were a burglar .
i just dropped in to go into a few things ...
check some measurements ...
do one or two odd jobs .
oh , and i've got a prospective tenant .
what's wrong with this door?
her interest is aroused .
that's not the bedroom .
no , that's the downstairs bathroom and wc .
the housekeeper , mrs crockett .
clackett , dear .
she's not here .
it's the royal .
it's black and white at home .
don't worry about us .
we'll just inspect the house .
now i've lost the newspaper .
sardines !
sorry about this .
that's all right .
we don't want the tv .
sardines !
i forgot the sardines .
lloyd !
these damned sardines !
we can't go on like this .
can't go on like what , garry?
it's ok for you , but we work with them , don't we?
sorry?
the sardines?
we're working our asses off and there are four plates of sardines in act one .
poppy !
you want something instead of sardines?
you want mashed banana?
we don't want mashed banana .
we're changing the sardines .
we're not angry at you , poppy .
i'm happy with the sardines if you are , hon .
i'm happy if you are .
garry , what are you saying?
here we are , busting our guts up here and , christ !
i see .
you got that , poppy?
well ...
right .
on we go from dotty's exit .
and poppy?
don't let this happen again .
no .
sorry . just getting that straight .
as long as dotty's happy .
absolutely .
do something for me , dotty .
anything .
take the sardines off with you .
i'm sorry about this .
that's all right .
we don't want the tv .
she's been in the family for generations .
come on .
i've got to be in basingstoke by 4 . 00 .
perhaps just some champagne?
upstairs .
and bring my files .
only ...
what?
her?
she has been here for generations .
sardines , sardines ...
it's not for me to say , but i will say this : take the plunge , you'll enjoy it here .
won't she?
yes , well ...
we'll enjoy having you , won't we?
terrific !
sardines ...
can't put your feet up on an empty stomach .
she thinks it's great .
she's making us sardines .
she's terrific .
terrific .
so , which way?
all right .
before she comes back with the sardines .
up here?
in here?
yes , yes , yes .
another bathroom .
you always try to get me in the bathrooms !
i mean in here .
ooh !
black sheets !
that's the linen closet .
this one , this one !
you're in a real state .
can't even get the door open .
it's mrs clackett's afternoon off .
hold it !
look at it !
hold it !
and god said , " hold it !
and they held it .
and god saw that it was terrible .
the door won't open .
this door won't close .
and god said , " poppy !
you know i'm stupid about doors .
you're doing perfectly .
as long as i didn't break it .
and there was poppy .
and god said ,
be fruitful and multiply and fetch tim to fix the doors .
i love tech rehearsals !
she loves tech rehearsals !
isn't she , just ...
where's dotty?
everyone's always so nice .
belinda's being all , you know?
freddy , don't you like an all night tech?
only because you can sit on the furniture .
it's good to see you making jokes .
oh , was that a joke?
this is such a nice company to work with .
broadway in six months !
cleveland in three !
all right , lloyd?
i know what god felt like when he sat in the dark , creating the world .
what did he feel like?
pleased he'd taken his valium .
he had six days .
we've only got six hours .
and god said , " where the hell is tim?
and there was tim .
and god said , " let there be doors that open and close .
do something?
i was getting the bananas .
doors !
i bet god had a stage manager who understood english , too .
that door won't close .
and the bedroom won't , you know?
he hasn't been to bed for 48 hours .
don't worry !
only another 24 hours .
look , he's come down to earth amongst us .
listen , since we've stopped ...
it took two days to do the set , so we shan't have time for a dress rehearsal .
don't worry .
think of the first night as the dress .
if we can just get through tonight for doors and sardines .
it's all about doors and sardines , getting on and off , getting the sardines on and off .
that's farce .
that's the theatre .
that's life .
oh , god , lloyd .
you're so deep .
so just keep going .
bang !
bang !
bang !
bang , you're on !
bang , you've said it !
bang , you're off !
where's selsdon?
oh , god !
selsdon !
poppy !
i thought he was out front .
is mr mowbray in his dressing room?
would he , during a tech?
would who?
selsdon .
he wouldn't during a tech .
half a chance , he would .
what?
be fair .
let's not jump to conclusions .
get the understudy .
tim !
yes?
hurry up with the doors .
you're going on for selsdon .
he should never have been let out of our sight .
i said that .
he's been good in rehearsals .
in the rehearsal hall , it was all ... you know?
you could see everyone .
here , there's a front and a back and we've lost him .
he's not in his dressing room .
bathroom?
prop room?
paint shop?
call the police !
doors finished?
get the gear on !
i'm sorry , dotty , my precious .
no , it's my fault .
i cast him .
i said , " give him one last chance .
we did summer stock together when i was a kid .
it's my fault , sweetheart .
this tour is her life savings .
we know that , garry .
i'm not out to make my fortune .
i just wanted to put something away .
we know .
a little house .
it's not much to ask .
don't blame yourself .
sorry?
don't cry .
i've got something behind my lens .
it's not brooke's fault .
he was right there before we started .
who?
it's all right .
we know you can't see .
you mean selsdon?
i'm not blind .
i can see selsdon .
selsdon !
he's here !
standing there like hamlet's father .
we thought you were ... not there .
where have you been?
are you all right?
speak to us .
is it a party?
is it a party?
is it?
how killing !
i thought there was going to be a rehearsal .
i was having a post prandial snooze so as to be ready for the rehearsal .
isn't he lovely?
now we can see him .
what are we celebrating?
what are we celebrating?
tim , you look strained and anxious .
i can't find the gear .
i've looked in his wardrobe ...
oh .
beer?
in the wardrobe?
no , selsdon .
you need a break .
why don't you sit down and do the payroll?
i'll do the bananas first .
he's been up for 48 hours .
and don't fall down , tim .
we may not be insured .
what's next?
i thought we might try a rehearsal .
i won't , thank you .
you won't?
no , i'll watch .
is this the beer in the wardrobe?
no , he wants to rehearse .
but shouldn't we rehearse?
i knew you'd think of something .
from belinda and freddy's entrance .
what's happened now?
the police .
they've found an old man in a doorway .
thank you .
they say he's dirty and smelly .
i thought , " oh , my god ! " because when you get close to selsdon ...
poppy !
no , if you stand anywhere near him , you can't help noticing this very distinctive ...
i tell you , poppy , once you get it in your nostrils , you never forget it .
sixty years now , and the smell of the theatre still haunts me .
bless him !
poppy , how did you get a job like this that requires tact?
you're not somebody's girlfriend?
don't worry .
he did not hear .
not here?
yes , there .
go to sleep .
you're not on for 20 pages .
i might go back to sleep .
i'm not on for 20 pages .
on we go .
dotty in the kitchen with sardines .
garry and brooke on the stairs , freddy and belinda waiting outside , time sliding into the past .
aren't they sweet?
garry and dotty .
you mean , they're ...?
it's supposed to be a secret .
but she's old enough to be ... !
didn't you know?
i'm just god .
i don't know anything .
what's happening?
you tell me .
what are we waiting for?
her 1 8th birthday?
or maybe just the cue .
brooke !
you can't even get the door open .
you can't even get the door open .
door closed , garry , love !
you can't even get the door open .
we've got the place entirely to ourselves .
look at it !
i can't believe it !
a perfect place for an assignation !
home .
our secret hideaway .
the last place anyone will look .
it's funny creeping in .
if the inland revenue find out , bang goes our claim to be resident abroad , bang goes most of this year's income .
i wonder if mrs clackett's aired the beds .
darling !
why not?
no children , no friends .
we're on our own .
true .
there is something to be said for being a tax exile .
leave those !
shh !
the inland revenue may hear us .
what i did with that first lot of sardines i shall never know .
mrs clackett !
my heart jumped out of my boots !
so did mine .
i thought you were in spain .
we are .
we're not here .
the income tax are after you?
they would be if they knew .
all right , love .
you're not here .
i haven't seen you .
off to bed , are you?
well ...
nowhere like bed when it all gets on top of you .
you'll want your things .
yes .
that bed isn't aired .
i'll get a hot water bottle .
all your letters are in the study .
you forward them , don't you?
not the ones from the income tax .
oh , my god !
where are they?
in the little pigeon house , dear .
in the pigeon house?
i could hear voices .
what sort of voices?
hold it !
what's the trouble?
you know how stupid i am about moves .
sorry .
why do i take the things into the study?
shouldn't i leave them?
no .
i thought it might be more logical .
no .
i know it's late in the day , but ...
no , several minutes before we open .
as long as we're not too rushed .
why does he carry the bag and groceries into the study?
they have to be out of the way .
i see that .
and selsdon needs them in the study .
where is selsdon?
is he there?
selsdon !
selsdon !
am i on?
no , no .
i thought i heard my voice .
no .
go back to sleep .
you're not on for 10 pages .
i see all that .
oh , no .
but why?
why does anyone do anything?
why does that other idiot go out with sardines?
i'm not getting at you .
of course not .
jesus , why do i?
who knows?
who knows?
the wellsprings of human action are deep and cloudy .
maybe something happened when you were a small child that made you frightened to let go of groceries .
it could be genetic .
or ... you know .
it could be .
i understand all that ...
i'm telling you i don't know .
i don't think the author knows .
i don't know why the author came into this industry .
or any of us .
if you could just give me a reason .
all right .
i'll give you a reason .
you carry them into the study because it's slightly after midnight and we're not going to be finished before we open tomorrow .
correction .
before we open tonight !
and on we go , from after freddy's exit , with groceries .
lloyd , sweetheart , his wife left him this morning .
oh .
freddy?
i think the point is , you had a great fright when she mentions income tax and you felt insecure and exposed and you wanted something familiar to hold on to .
thank you , lloyd .
bless you !
and on we merrily go .
yes , but i could hear voices .
yes , but i could hear voices .
what voices?
people's !
no one's here .
i saw the door handle move .
must you put your tie on to look?
mrs clockett .
she's been here for generations .
look , she's opened our sardines .
you can't go down like that .
why not?
mrs crackett .
she's irreplaceable .
sardines here , sardines there !
it's like a sunday school outing .
you still poking around?
yes , still poking .
still around .
in the linen closet?
no , no !
yes , just checking the sheets , going through the inventory .
mrs blackett ...
clackett .
is there anyone else in the house?
no one .
i thought i heard voices .
no voices here .
i must have imagined it .
oh , my god !
i beg your pardon !
oh , my god !
why?
what is it?
oh , my god !
the study door's open .
oh , my god !
there's another car outside .
that's not mr hackham's , is it?
nothing but flapping doors in this house .
final notice , steps will be taken , foreclosure , proceedings in court ...
a gentleman come about the house .
i'm not here .
he's got a lady quite aroused .
leave it to the agents .
shall i let them go all over?
anything , but don't tell anyone we're here .
i'll just sit down and ...
sardines !
i've forgotten the sardines .
if it wasn't fixed to my shoulders , i'd forget what day it was .
i didn't get this .
i'm in spain .
if i didn't get it , i didn't open it .
did i have a dress like this?
i shouldn't buy anything this tarty .
did you give me it?
never should have touched it !
stick it down !
never saw it !
i'll put it in the attic with your other precious gifts .
all right .
now the study door's open again .
what's going on?
knocking !
upstairs .
oh , my god !
there's something in the linen closet .
oh , it's you !
of course it's me .
you put me in there with the black sheets .
why did you lock the door?
why did you?
i didn't !
someone did .
we can't stand here ... in your underwear .
ok , i'll take it off .
in here !
this glue isn't the sort you can never get unstuck , is it?
hold it !
mrs clackett's made us sardines .
we have a problem .
which one this time?
left .
it's the left one .
left one !
left one !
could be anywhere .
could have bounced .
where did you last see it?
it was in her eye .
she opens her eyes very ... don't you?
i feel i should rush forward .
careful where you put your feet .
everyone look under their feet .
no one move their feet !
put your feet back where they were !
pick up your feet one at a time .
brooke , is this going to happen during a performance?
she'll keep going .
can she see?
can she hear without them?
sorry?
oh , sorry !
you stepped on his hand !
oh , look at freddy , the poor thing !
what's the matter?
nose bleed .
no one touched him .
violence makes his nose bleed .
sorry .
i thought you spoke to me .
hit the manager with this to finish off theatre in des moines .
anyway , i've found it .
where?
in my eye .
nice going .
your left eye?
yes .
round the side .
i knew it hadn't gone far .
ok?
i think so .
clear the stage .
walking wounded carry stretcher cases .
all right , freddy?
i just have a thing about ...
we understand .
on we bloodily stagger .
freddy , i'll rephrase that .
on we blindly stumble .
brooke , i withdraw that .
anyway ...
where's selsdon?
selsdon !
selsdon !
she might have dropped it out here .
good .
keep looking .
only another five pages , selsdon .
anyway , we can't stand here ... in your underwear .
ok , i'll take it off .
darling , this isn't the sort of glue that never comes unstuck , is it?
oh , mrs clackett's made us sardines .
now what?
a hot water bottle .
i didn't put it there .
i didn't .
someone in the bathroom filling it .
is something creepy going on?
darling , are you coming to bed?
what did you say?
nothing .
the door handle , the hot water bottle ...
i've got goose pimples .
get something on .
under the covers .
what did i do with the sardines?
you hear funny things about old houses .
but this one has been modernised .
nothing creepy could survive ...
what?
what is it?
what's happening?
the sardines !
they've gone !
there is something funny going on .
i'm going to put my head under the ...
i put them there .
bag !
mrs sprockett must have taken them away .
bag !
what?
what is it?
bag !
bag !
what do you mean?
bag !
bag !
what bag?
no bag !
your bag suddenly here , now gone !
it's in the bedroom .
don't go in there !
the box !
they've both gone .
my files !
what's happening?
wait here !
no !
get dressed !
i'm not going in there .
i'll fetch your dress .
your dress has gone .
don't panic !
don't panic !
there's some rational explanation .
mrs splodgett will tell us .
you wait here .
no , you can't stand here like that .
wait in the study .
study , study !
roger , there's something in there .
where are you?
i know this is going to sound silly , but ...
i'm going to clear out the attic .
i'm glued to a tax demand .
why don't you put the sardines down?
i'm stuck to the sardines .
get that bottle marked " poison " .
it eats through anything .
i've heard of people being stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous !
selsdon !
you're on , selsdon !
we're there .
the moment's arrived .
it's all right .
he's coming .
the arm should have come through .
ah !
here it comes .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be ...
hold it , selsdon .
let's take it again .
hold it , selsdon !
hold it !
lloyd wants you to hold it .
stop , selsdon !
my god !
like the band playing on as the titanic sank .
stop?
thank you .
selsdon ...
my dad was nearly on the titanic .
he can hear better than i can .
from your entrance .
it was before the war , so ...
thank you .
poppy !
no .
stops me sleeping .
put the glass back .
come on again?
right , only sooner .
like yesterday .
freddy !
start when freddy opens the door .
what's the line?
i've heard of getting stuck with a problem .
start moving on , " i've heard of getting stuck with a problem .
i want your arm through the window , right?
may i make one suggestion?
what?
would it perhaps be better if i came on earlier?
only there's a hiatus between freddy's exit and my entrance .
no , selsdon , listen .
yeah?
i've got it .
what?
come on a little earlier .
we're thinking along the same lines .
am i putting him on or vice versa?
freddy , from your exit .
i've heard of getting stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .
it makes me weep when i think i used to do banks , bullion vaults .
what am i doing now?
breaking into paper bags .
i know they're in spain because the old turkey in the kitchen said so .
and i saw her go out in her swimming costume .
get the van loaded .
no rush .
only got all flaming afternoon .
what have they got to offer?
one microwave oven .
# 50 .
hardly worth lifting it .
cor !
come here !
junk , junk , junk !
well , yes , if you insist .
now , where's his desk?
they all say the same thing : it's hard to adjust to retirement .
the prospective tenant wishes to know of any history of the paranormal .
yes , everything's nice and paranormal here .
has anything ever dematerialised or flown about?
no , things move on their own two feet , just like in any house .
i'll tell the prospective tenant .
she's inspecting the study .
there's a man !
there's no one !
he's searching for something .
i can't see no one .
this is extraordinary !
where's my prospective tenant?
she's gone !
disappeared !
oh , my god !
now what?
the sardines !
can you see them?
yes .
i can see the way they're going .
i'm not letting them out of my hand .
but where is she?
i can see i'm going to be opening sardines all night .
he said , " it's time to hand over the ammonia bottle to a younger man .
where's she gone?
i may be 70 , " i said ,
but i've still got all my wits about me .
he didn't have an answer to that .
vicki !
vicki !
or , if he did , i didn't hear it .
darling , where are you?
that stuff doesn't eat through glue , just trousers .
you don't think it eats through ...?
i'd better get these trousers off .
this is an emergency !
if it eats through anything ...
i can feel it !
it's eating through everything !
an evil house !
the inland revenue !
he's back !
i'm not here !
oh , my god !
i'm abroad .
i must go .
stay !
speak !
only in the presence of my lawyer .
hold on !
you're just an intruder !
an ordinary intruder .
nice to meet you .
have a sardine .
no , you're a sex criminal .
you've done something to vicki .
i'll sort you out .
you've got sardines .
if there's nothing i can offer , i'll be running along .
come back !
hello?
police?
someone has broken into my house ... ... into someone's house , and a young woman is missing .
it's in the garden now , a man !
she's reappeared .
are you ok?
no !
he almost saw me !
he almost saw her !
he's taken our things .
the things are here !
they're back !
we're just missing sardines .
here they are !
we've found them .
this is the police?
you want the police here?
in my underwear?
let's say no more .
i thought something terrible had happened .
it has .
i know him .
you know him?
he's dealt with by our office .
he mustn't see me like this .
the inland revenue has standards .
put something on .
i haven't got anything .
try the bathroom .
and bring the sardines .
i said , " when have i had to run off in the middle of a job for a piddle?
oh , my god !
where is it?
stay there till you're dressed .
i can't talk about tax in this !
i knew i shouldn't have brought the subject up .
help !
where are you?
put it on !
it's a start .
i'll find a bottom .
i'll find a top .
something .
someone in there !
it's him , it's him !
i'm finding such lovely things .
remember the biscuit tin you gave me on our first anniversary?
who are you?
oh , my god !
i've taken your dress off you .
where have you been?
i've been going mad !
look at the state i'm in !
i was trying to explain about the inland revenue and my fingers got stuck .
don't wave it in my face .
i'm trying to find something .
pair of gold taps .
oh , god !
who are you?
doing the taps .
income tax?
that's right .
in come the new taps , out go the old .
tax inspectors everywhere !
oh , my god !
boxes flying about !
there is something funny going on .
are you dressed yet?
i've got the dress stuck to my head now .
a man !
doing the taps .
attacks?
on women?
i'll do the taps on the bath first .
sex criminals everywhere .
where is vicki?
vicki !
i'm off .
tax on women?
they'll tax anything these days .
you're in trouble , you see?
wc?
i'll fix it .
vicki !
sheikh !
i thought you were coming at 4 . 00 !
and this is your charming wife?
you want to see over the house now?
since you're upstairs ...
him and his floozy !
let's start downstairs .
who are you?
i don't know who she is .
no connection with the house .
this good lady with the sardines ...
this time , i'm eating them . ... is fully occupied .
the toilet facilities ...
mrs clackett , who are these people?
just arab sheikhs .
i'm sorry .
this is the downstairs bathroom .
upstairs , we have ...
your ballcocks have gone .
we have him .
irish linen sheets off my own bed !
in the study , however ...
give me that sheet !
there she stands in her smalls for all the world to see .
it's my little girl .
dad !
my little vicki that ran away .
would you believe it?
what are you doing here?
what about you?
i'm taking our files on tax evasion to basingstoke .
where's my other sheet?
ah , a house of heavenly peace !
i rent it !
you !
is it?
i still have my trousers round my ankles .
i have no dresser .
get tim to help you .
tim !
where's tim?
come on , tim !
what?
oh , you're acting .
i must have dozed off .
never mind .
do something?
no , we'll struggle through .
tim sleeps while we run around with our trousers round our ankles .
ok , freddy , from your entrance with trousers round ankles .
so , where's my other sheet?
some other problem , freddy?
since we're stopped ...
why did i ask?
i'm stupid about plot .
could i ask another dumb question?
all of my studies in world drama lie at your disposal .
why is the sheikh philip's double?
he comes in and we think he's , you know ...
that's the joke .
i see that .
the plot depends on it .
but it is a coincidence , isn't it?
it is kind of a coincidence , freddy , yes .
until you reflect that there was an earlier draft of the play .
in this , it's clear that philip's father , as a young man , travelled in the middle east .
i see .
you see?
interesting .
yes .
will the audience get it?
you show them .
that's what acting's about .
thank you , lloyd .
so , from your entrance , freddy .
what's going to be left of this show when i'm back in new york and you're up there on your own?
so , where's my other sheet?
ah !
a house of heavenly peace !
i rent it !
you !
is it?
who else?
you ask to view this house when you're a trouserless tramp !
you took the clean sheets !
you snatched my nightdress .
you tossed me aside like a broken china doll .
i won't ask what you were up to with my girl , but i'll tell you one thing .
brooke !
sorry .
your line !
we're two lines from the end of the act .
i don't understand .
tell her .
" what's that , dad?
but i don't understand .
i say , " i'll tell you something .
you say , " what's that , dad?
i don't understand why the sheikh looks like philip .
poppy !
bring the book !
is it " i don't understand why the sheikh looks like philip "?
can we consult the author's text?
what's that , dad?
right .
that's the line .
we know you've worked in places where you make it up as you go along , but we don't want that here , not when there's a polished line already .
not at 1 a . m . , not two lines from the end of act one .
not when we're about to get a coffee break .
we merely want to hear the line " what's that , dad? " that's all .
nothing else !
i'm not being unreasonable , am i?
exit?
does it say " exit "?
oh , my god .
she's going to wash away her lenses .
oh , dear .
a little heavy .
i thought it was going to be poppy .
this is all my fault .
why brooke?
it was sweet .
sweet?
a lovers 'quarrel .
you mean lloyd and brooke?
where do you think they've been all weekend?
that's why he didn't realise the set was wrong .
shh !
here they come .
all forgotten .
i was irresistible .
i'm going to throw up .
what?
oh , no !
oh , god !
poppy?
you pig !
you mean ...?
i didn't know that .
i'm going to faint .
head between your knees .
nothing she didn't know !
two weeks 'rehearsal .
that's all !
what's next?
most exciting .
is she all right?
she will be .
something she ate .
this one's a bit , you know?
i'm feeling a bit , you know , myself .
i need that coffee break .
you're certainly overdoing it .
can we just have the last line of the act?
me?
last line?
right .
well , i'll tell you one thing , vicki .
what's that , dad?
when all around is uncertainty , there's nothing like a good old fashioned plate of sardines .
and curtain !
oh .
all right .
let's reset for night , act two .
in fact , they loved it in des moines .
at the end of act two , they laughed .
what's this?
there's only one thing missing : a plate of sardines .
yeah .
they clapped and clapped .
in des moines .
well , they clapped .
even selsdon heard them .
but then there was decatur , illinois , then there was cairo , missouri , and paducah , kentucky .
i wasn't there for the difficulties in decatur or the problems in paducah , but i couldn't always hold their hands .
how could i be in decatur and paducah when i was doing hamlet in new york?
i caught up with the show in miami beach .
i was right in there with them when they did that famous matine .
sir , your ticket?
i'm the director .
don't tell anyone .
act one places .
your calls , miss otley , miss ashton ,
mr lejeune , mr dallas , miss blair .
act one places , please .
do you think we'll get act one places?
she'll pull herself together now we've called places .
won't she?
will she?
you know dotty .
we're only at miami beach .
what will it be like by cleveland?
if only she'd speak .
or unlock the door .
if she won't go on ...
won't .
if she won't ...
of course she will , but if she doesn't ...
she must !
she will .
but if she didn't ...
i'd have five minutes to change .
four .
if only she'd say something .
i'll try again .
helps take your mind off your own problems .
has she gone?
lloyd !
i didn't know you were coming to miami beach .
i wasn't .
good you're here !
dotty and garry ...
no one must know i'm in .
hide this somewhere .
right ...
they've had a fight .
there's a flower stall round the back .
buy some expensive looking flowers .
right .
dotty's locked herself in .
don't let poppy see .
she won't speak to anyone .
the matine finishes by five .
i want two hours alone with brooke in her dressing room , then i'm back to new york .
there may not be a show .
she's walked out already?
she's locked in and won't speak .
you've called places?
yes .
i can't do it in five minutes .
she's broken up with garry before .
brooke?
not brooke , dotty .
there was the one the week before last in pittsburgh .
she went out with a reporter , but garry threatened to kill him .
don't worry .
dotty's got money in the show .
but last night , garry wakes me at 2 a . m . asking where dotty is .
let me tell you about my life .
hamlet's ghost complains every evening that polonius is sucking sourballs through his speeches .
claudius is off doing a soap and gertrude is off doing a commercial .
hamlet himself has come down with a psychological problem .
then brooke rings to say she's got a doctor's certificate for exhaustion .
i can't find a new vicki .
i have just one afternoon while hamlet sees his shrink to cure brooke of her exhaustion with some whisky , a few flowers you've got the money and a certain fading bedside manner .
i haven't come to hear others 'problems , but to be taken out of myself and not put back .
but ...
done the front of house calls?
front of house calls .
don't let poppy see those flowers !
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the curtain will rise in three minutes .
we're going to be so late .
no luck?
i haven't even started the front of house calls .
money .
is that for me?
no , no !
whisky .
where did you find that?
not up here?
he's hiding it up here !
i'll put it downstairs where he can't find it .
no?
you know dotty .
freddy's trying .
god !
he's hiding them here .
no?
no .
you didn't try for long .
he's hiding them here now .
garry came rushing out .
i couldn't understand him .
i am stupid .
but i think he wanted to kill me .
you poor thing !
i left him alone .
is he all right?
anything but !
he's going on?
going on?
garry?
of course garry's going on !
if you have to go on for garry , poppy can't go on for dotty .
oh , god !
money !
for us?
no ...
oh , my god !
dotty's so up and down .
she was perfectly all right last night .
last night?
she took me to a pub she knows .
she was with you?
you were with her?
she was very sympathetic .
she's not sinking her teeth in !
no .
she came up for coffee and told me her troubles .
we talked till 3 a . m .
i don't know what room service thought .
and another thing .
where's selsdon?
it turns out freddy ...
selsdon?
not in his dressing room .
front of house calls !
do them .
i'll get selsdon .
what should i do?
nothing .
you've done enough already .
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the curtain will rise in three minutes .
he wants to kill someone?
selsdon?
garry .
we've lost selsdon .
oh , my god !
flowers !
they're just , you know .
tim , that's sweet of you .
isn't that sweet?
charming .
i'll look in the bar .
hold these .
i'll take those .
front of house calls !
hold these .
poppy's done them .
did she give them two minutes?
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the curtain will rise in one minute .
i think she said three minutes .
did she?
i think so .
hold these .
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the curtain will rise in two minutes .
any luck?
no , but i found this .
hidden behind the fire extinguisher .
i'll take it .
put it somewhere out of sight .
he's ... not in the bar .
have you checked the green room?
yes .
i'll check again .
take your seats .
the curtain will rise in two minutes .
tim's said that .
he has?
take your seats .
the curtain will rise in one minute .
what the fuck is going on?
lloyd !
i didn't know you were here .
i'm in new york .
but i can't sit out there and listen to that .
we're having big dramas back here .
and out there .
this is a matine .
senior citizens !
curtain up in three minutes , we all start for the gents .
one minute , we run out again .
i've got to talk to you .
just tell me one thing .
is brooke going on?
brooke?
you're going on , aren't you?
sorry?
all right?
all right?
she sounds like her usual self .
lloyd !
what's this?
i was lying on the floor and ...
on the floor?
for relaxation .
i saw it behind the radiator .
oh , my god !
i'll hide it .
in brooke's dressing room .
what's this?
oh , yes .
sorry .
tim bought them for me .
you?
we've got to talk .
i've heard all i want .
what about dotty?
no !
selsdon?
this show is beyond my help .
just do it .
i'll sit out there with a bag of sweets and enjoy it .
one minute was the last call , if you remember .
is she all right?
it's her way of relaxing .
i couldn't concentrate back there with the shouting .
it's her breathing .
you don't have to go on .
it's only a matine .
i'm sure poppy would love to do it .
i'll see what's up with dotty .
freddy , my darling !
what?
where's tim?
where have you been?
we looked for you everywhere .
everywhere .
there's no sign of him .
he's been looking for you .
great shindig going on back there .
i thought tim should know .
he's heard .
everything !
he really went for her !
i've seen the way you're looking at freddy , " he says .
oh , god !
me?
yes , darling .
are you sure?
maybe teddy .
teddy or freddy .
anyway ...
they're coming !
i knew they wouldn't .
and you're here?
yes .
every word .
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats .
the performance is about to begin .
they're coming !
we found selsdon .
how did you get here?
how?
she took it amiss .
ladies and gentlemen , take your seats ...
i've done it !
i've done it !
oh .
lloyd will choke on his sweets !
garry , darling !
trying to give a fellow a leg up , or a leg over ...
oh , there he is .
are you all right?
what did he say?
nothing .
very sensible .
you've got your claws into freddy , " he said .
dotty !
is she all right?
she's fine .
all right , everyone?
teddy or freddy .
hush , dear !
places , please .
garry , dotty , i won't make a big speech , but we've got to go and perform .
and , well ...
we can't do it in silence .
we have to speak to each other .
what's the house like?
that's the spirit !
well done !
good for a matine .
there's a crowd at the back of the orchestra .
come on .
some of those seniors haven't got long .
quiet , then , please .
pre set , please .
quiet on stage , stand by , curtain up , act one .
now what?
we're going up .
we've been sitting out there an hour .
i was just saying a few words .
you need a brain transplant .
wrong moment .
i see that .
any other thoughts to communicate?
not right now .
later .
you bought these flowers for poppy?
no , well , yes .
and none for ... b?
well , no .
have you heard of jealous rage?
yes .
then take $ 1 0 of your money and buy some flowers for me !
you two can have freddy's old brain .

i can't open sardines and answer the phone .
i've only got one pair of hands .

this is my housekeeper's afternoon off ,
so we've got the place to ourselves .
wow !

yes , yes , yes !
it's another bathroom .
no , no , no !
ooh !
black sheets !
it's the linen closet .
this one , this one .
you're in a state .
you can't even get the door open .
it's mrs clackett's afternoon off .
we've got the place to ourselves .
look at it !
do you like it?
i can't believe it !
a perfect place for an assignation ...
sardines here , sardines there !
it's like a sunday school outing .
oh , my god !
i beg your pardon?
oh , my god !
why , what is it?
my god , the study door's open ...
nothing ... but ... flapping ... ... doors ... in ... this ... house ...
give it to me !
darling , i never had a ...
i never had a dress ...
or , rather , flowers like these?
oh , didn't you?
i shouldn't buy anything as tarty ...
oh , god !
all right !
now the study door's open again .
what's going on?
knocking !
knocking?
knocking .
upstairs !
there's something in the linen closet !
oh , it's you .
is it you?
i mean , hidden under all the sheets and towels in here?
i can't , you know , just stand here indefinitely .
of course it's me .
you put me here with all the black sheets .
darling , why did you lock the door?
i didn't .
why did you lock the door?
i didn't .
anyway , we can't stand here like this .
like what?
in your underwear .
ok , i'll take it off .
you !
on !
darling , this isn't the glue you can never get unstuck , is it?
oh , look !
mrs clackett's made us some sardines .
a hot water bottle?
i didn't put it there .
i didn't ...
i mean , i'm standing here with this hot water bottle in my hand !
of course it's me !
you put me in here with all the black sheets .
someone in the bathroom?
what?
don't panic !
don't panic !
why did you lock the door?
don't panic !
don't panic !
there's a rational explanation ...
you wait in the study .
study , study !
oh !
there's something in there ...
i've heard of getting stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous .
i've heard of getting stuck with a problem ... ... but this is ridiculous !
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .
lloyd .
ooh , yes ...
a line?
a prompt?
get the van loaded .
what?
get the van loaded !
right ...
get the van loaded .
there's a man in there !
no one's there .
look !
he's searching for something .
no one ...
oh , no !
oh , dear !
there's something even in this ...
you're a sex criminal !
i'm going to come and sort you ...
you've got sardines?
if there's nothing i can offer you ...
are you all right?
you killed him !
police !
i think i'll be running along .
come back !
hello?
police?
someone has broken into my house ...
and a young woman is missing .
and a young woman is missing .
and a young ... ... woman is missing !
it's in the garden now , and it's a ...
tim !
no sheikh yet?
i thought he was coming at four .
i mean , it's nearly ... ... four now , well , it's after three .
i've been standing here for ever .
lloyd , listen !
i've got to talk to you now .
now is ...
not a good time .
i know .
it never is .
you're right !
freddy's quick change !
christ , his change !
those thieving devils !
give me that sheet !
there she stands , in her sheet that won't come off so no one can see her .
my little girl !
as far as i could see .
dad !
surely that was my little vicki ...
so , where's my ...?
so , where's my other sheet?
ah !
a house of heavenly peace !
i rent it !
i've tried calling you .
i know you're in rehearsals , but you're never there .
no !
i'm not going to be put off !
i know you'll be seeing her .
she's being difficult , isn't she?
then you'll be on the next train to new york .
i bet there's somebody else in hamlet , but you can't just walk away .
i'm sorry , but you've got to hear because i'm pregnant .
and curtain !
if you thought miami beach was as bad as it could get , you were mistaken .
things got a lot worse backstage by the time we got to spartanburg .
after spartanburg was lynchburg .
after lynchburg , parkersburg and petersburg .
after parkersburg and petersburg , there was peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers burg .
but nothing could have prepared us for the final horror .
cleveland .
i'm something you'll never be , and that's a star !
your cockney accent sounds like dolly parton .
stay away from freddy !
he never did anything to you !
garry was using you !
quiet !
hold on !
i'm coming !
hold your horses .
i'll be right there .
hold on !
i can't get sardines off the floor and answer the phone .
i've only got one leg .
hello?
hello?
yes , but there's no one here , love .
mr brent's not here now .
he lives in spain .
yes , he writes plays , though why he wants to get mixed up in plays , god knows .
he'd be safer in a snake pit .
no , she's in spain , too .
they're all in spain .
am i in spain?
no , i'm not in spain !
i'm in agony , that's where i am !
we haven't been on the road three months and she's trying to kill me !
i'm standing with a plate of sardines and she kicks me in the ...
where the hell are they?
if it's to do with renting ...
selsdon !
selsdon?
i can't find him .
i'll find him .
no , they're next to the study in the phone .
squire , squire , hackham and ...
hold on !
i'm going to do something wrong here .
oh , yes !
always the same .
as soon as you've got too much on your plate , you go putting your foot in it .
oh , speak of the devil .
they'll all go putting their foot in it now , won't they?
well ...
i'll just put that down .
that'll keep them out of harm's way .
what i'm holding now i don't know .
and off i go at last .
my housekeeper , yes , but this is her afternoon off .
so we've got the place entirely to ourselves .
wow !
i'll just check .
hello?
anyone at home?
no , there's no one here .
so , what do you think?
great !
is it all yours?
just a little shack in the woods .
converted mill , sixteenth century .
well , one has to have somewhere to entertain business associates .
someone on the phone now , by the look of it .
probably this arab , saying he's coming at four .
i'll have a word with him .
i've got to get those files to basingstoke by four .
we'll just manage to pick it in , to fit it up , i mean ...
right , then .
we won't pull the champagne .
all these doors !
only a handful : study , kitchen and the flat for the ... receiver .
terrific !
which one's the ...
what?
you know .
oh , yes , through here .
it's , umm ... through here .
fantastic .
i've come for my sardines .
i thought no one was here .
i'm not .
i'm from the agents .
lost the phone now .
never lost the phone before .
i'm tramplemain .
i'll put it here in case it's wanted .
thanks .
i dropped in to check some measurements , do some odd jobs .
the plate's gone .
i've got a prospective tenant .
what's wrong with this door?
her interest is aroused .
that's not the bedroom .
no , no .
that's the bathroom .
this is the housekeeper , mrs crockett .
sardines !
sardines !
she's not really here .
you're standing on them .
it's the royal .
you shouldn't have !
don't worry about us .
i need them !
we'll inspect the house .
i'll have to wash the floor .
sorry about this .
that's all right .
we don't want a tv .
a tv?
right .
she didn't explain about wanting to watch the royal because of this thing with the ...
in case somebody's looking at this and thinking , " my god !
i've got to be gone by four .
just getting that straight .
we'll take it up .
bring my files .
where are we?
what?
her?
her?
ok , her !
she's been in the family for generations .
i'll wash the floor with this and they'll be out of your way .
look what i've got .
great !
like a battlefield back there .
terrific !
i'll put this here .
then , if he wants it , he won't know where to find it .
you'll have to do the sardines because i've got to do more sardines .
see?
she's even making us sardines .
what do you think?
she's terrific .
do you want ...?
which way?
i don't know .

box !
oh !
black sheets !
box , box , bag , bag !
you're in a real state .
if we haven't got the , you know , upstairs , i mean ...
you can't even open the door .
this is mrs clackett's afternoon off .
we've got the place to ourselves .
look at it !
i can't believe it .
perfect for an assignation .
home !
the phone was in the garden .
i'll put it back .
someone's bound to want it .
put it on the table .
the wire's caught .
look !
it's caught round the downstairs bathroom .
i've disentangled it .
i climbed in the window and ...
oh .
anyway , our secret hideaway .
the last place anyone will ...
look for us?
yes .
it's funny creeping in like this .
what?
you're thinking it's damned serious .
sorry , yes .
damned serious .
about the inland revenue .
absolutely .
to cut a long story short , i think i'll wash up and go to bed .
but we must talk about the inland revenue .
if they find out we're in the country , bang goes our claim to be resident abroad .
leave those !
downstairs !
not upstairs !
the inland revenue may hear !
one moment they're kicking you , the next they expect more sardines .
mrs newspaper !
my heart jumped right out of itself !
we thought you'd gone .
i thought you were in sardinia .
we are !
you haven't seen us .
they brought me a present .
the taxman is after us .
i know who thought of this .
we're off to bed .
leaves them on the sofa !
is it aired?
i've got a surprise for you !
no?
i'll get a hot water bottle .
no !
no !
let me at her !
oh , dear !
she's left you on your own?
must you talk to yourself?
has she told you about your letters?
what?
the tax letters are in the study .
i say that !
in the pigeon house .
the pigeon house?
the pigeon hole !
anybody would think you were married .
but i could hear voices .
voices?
what sort of voices?
box voices ...
people's boxes .
there's no one here .
i saw the door handle move , and these bags , i mean ...
i'm not sure they were , you know , when we went in .
do you have to put your tie on?
if someone left them outside ,
i mean , they obviously wish them to be downstairs in the ...
mrs clockett?
could be .
carrying various things .
who knows?
you can't go like that .
mrs crackett .
she's irreplaceable .
well , at least i thanked her properly for the sardines .
still poking around , are you?
yes , still poking .
still pulling .
lucky i can't see far with this leg .
just trying all the doors , checking all the door handles .
mrs blackett .
clackett .
is there anyone else in the house?
no one .
i heard boxes ...
i found these voices .
no .
i must have imagined it .
oh , my god !
i beg your pardon?
oh , my god !
what is it?
oh , my god !
the study door's open .
they'll need these inside the ...
so i'll just put them outside the ...
then they can , you know?
nothing but flapping doors in this ... handle .
final notice , steps will be taken , foreclosure , proceedings in court ...
oh , my god !
who are you?
i'm philip .
you're philip?
what happened to you?
there were sardines on the floor and i slipped .
she's killed him !
she's killed you !
no , he's just a bit shaken .
i'll be all right in a minute .
you weren't going to tell me a gentleman had come about the house?
what?
a gentleman about the house?
a gentleman come about the house .
don't tell me .
i'm not here .
you haven't hurt himself?
leave everything to squire , squire , hackham and poppy .
all right , i'll just sit down and turn on the sardines .
i've forgotten the sardines .
no , i haven't .
i remembered the sardines .
well , what a surprise !
i'll just go and fix some more sardines to celebrate .
i didn't get this .
i'm not here .
i'm in spain .
but if i didn't get it , i didn't open it .
darling ...
i never had a handle like this .
didn't you?
i shouldn't buy anything this brassy .
or did you give it to me?
i should never have touched it .
it's lovely .
stick it down , put it back .
never saw it .
i'll put it in the attic in case anyone else wants to have a try .
all right .
now the study door's ... closed again .
what's going on?
knocking !
upstairs !
there's something in the linen ...
oh , my god !
listen , i can't .
i can't because the handle seems to have ...
you'll just have to ...
come on !
whatever's in there ...
can you hear me , darling?
there's no need to keep banging .
it won't , you know?
there's no place to ...
listen , climb round into the ...
squeeze through the , you know?
shin down the ...
there must be some way .
for god's sake !
final notice , steps will be taken , foreclosure , proceedings in court ...
it's you !
of course !
you put me in there with the black sheets .
i put you in there , but you squeezed through .
why did you lock the door?
i couldn't .
it's come off .
someone locked the door .
sorry .
you can't stand here like that .
i mean , with people going in and out .
ok , i'll take it off .
in here !
final notice , steps will be taken , foreclosure , proceedings in court ...
now what?
a hot water box !
i didn't put it there .
sorry .
is someone in the bathroom filling first aid bottles?
darling !
darling , are you coming to bed or aren't you?
what did you say?
nothing .
the door handle , the first water box .
i've got goose pimples .
get something on .
under the covers !
what about the sardines?
wait !
you hear funny things about old houses .
but this one has been modernised .
nothing creepy could survive ...
what?
what is it?
what's happening?
the sardines !
they've gone !
no , they haven't !
they're here !
oh !
well !
my god !
you put a plate of sardines down for two minutes and the last thing you expect to find , these days ...
you do not expect to find a plate of ...

i'm going to get into bed and put my head under the ...
because there they are , exactly where i ...

i'm not going in there .
i'll fetch your dress out here .
your dress has gone .
don't panic !
don't panic !
there's a rational explanation ...
... for this .
this is going to sound silly , but ...
i'm going to clear out the attic .
are you all right?
oh , my god !
she's killed him .
he's stunned .
oh , dear .
she put sardines on the stairs .
don't panic !
he's all right !
she'll get you next time .
there's a rational explanation .
i'll fetch mrs splodgett .

she'll tell us what's happening .
no , she won't .
she doesn't know .
i'll tell you .
a man's there .
no , he's not there .
he's here , and so am i.
no , no .
there's no one in the house .
no , i know this is a surprise .
it's quite a shock finding a man lying at the bottom of the stairs .
but now we've all met , we'll just have to introduce ourselves .
this is my husband .
he hates surprises .
so , why don't you get that stuff in the loo that eats through anything?
eats through anything .
right .
thank you .
i've heard of getting stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .
come in and join the party , honey .
a burglar !
this is most exciting .
it's my fault .
i say , " i've heard of getting stuck with a problem , " and open this door ...
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .
oh , dear .
i've done it again .
it makes me want to weep .
i know .
it's getting like a funeral .
when i think i used to do banks .
just keep going !
when i remember i used to do bullion vaults .
what am i doing now?
breaking into paper bags .
keep going .
i thought the coast was clear .
i saw him go through .
we'll think of something .
i was listening .
what's it he says?
i've heard of getting stuck with a problem , but this is ridiculous .
no bars , no burglar alarms .
they should be prosecuted for incitement .
oh , no !
they always come in threes .
when i think i used to do banks .
when i remember i used to do bullion vaults .
hold on !
we know this man !
he's not a burglar , he's our social worker !
he's that nice man who comes and tells us what to do .
i've been working on hamlet .
you think he needs it more?
he's playing the burglar now?
no .
let me think ...
fetch the sardines .
i've fetched the sardines .
you have?
she's fetched the sardines .
get the tax demand .
he has .
all right .
i suggest , i suggest ...
what's he saying?
he's saying , " ring the police !
ring the police !
it's for you .
no phone !
get the phone .
here's the phone .
we've found the phone !
pick it up !
pick it up !
it's the police .
i'll just tell them a young woman is missing .
it's in the garden now , and it's a man !
oh , it's her !
we forgot all about her .
no , he almost saw me .
what do you think of that?
i've got to get the 8 . 40 to new york .
ah !
house of heavenly peace .
i rent it .
oh , it's the other one !
in her wedding dress .
yes , yes !
it's their wedding day .
what a happy ending .
to the first act .
of their new life together .
they just want to be alone , if only someone would pull the shades .
come in?
it's the bride's mother .
go out?
pull the shades !
last line !
i'll tell you one thing , vicki .
what's that , dad?
when all around is uncertainty , there's nothing like a good , old fashioned plate of ... curtain !
what's this?
only one thing we're missing now : a plate of ...
sardines !
bravo !
yes !
i did it !
we did it !
my wonderful cast !
i knew we'd make it .
never doubted it for a moment .
let me tell you , you are a wonderful stage door keeper .
look at these two .
don't they make a wonderful couple?
tim's wonderful , she's wonderful , whoever she is .
poppy's wonderful , the baby's going to be wonderful .
we're all wonderful .
i'm wonderful .
that's all it takes for success . : wonderful actors , teamwork , dedication , six months on the road , professionalism .
plus something else i think some kind of miracle .
don't forget the miracle .
and by the way , another funny thing happened on the road .
i didn't tell you about this one .
you don't believe this?
neither do i.
never seen anything like it .
but what did shakespeare say?
there's no business like show business
like no business i know
