okay , there i am , and i'm gettin 'it on ...
with this perfect female body .
uh huh .
but ...
what?
what?
i can't say .
come on , man .
you can't give a buildup like that and not deliver .
a perfect female body .
it's not a bad start .
but the head of abraham lincoln .
aaah .
i mean , the hat and the beard .
oh , well .
best not think too deeply on this one , right?
best not .
i gotta get some stuff from mr. birchfield .
see ya in a few minutes .

sorry .
gilligan's transistor radio .
that was a good one .
what about that one where that sexy surfer guy catches that huge wave?
do you remember that?
oh , yeah !
the mosquitos .
remember that?
pink , let's go .
they were a rock group .
ginger and mary ann formed their own group ...
i can't go until miss wilk gets here , so get benny ... and check me out on the way back .
what?
coach gave me something to give to you .
they're really doin 'this .
yeah .
he wants 'em all back by the end of the day .
can you believe that?
and everybody's signing it?
just to get him off our backs .
the coach is just a big fuckin 'asshole .
you sign it , never think about it again .
just let it go .
you're gonna make a big deal outta this , aren't ya?
you're gettin 'air from there , man .
it's no good .
you see this?
it's gotta be tight .
put some gum around the base to get a good hit .
slate .
benny .
i ain't believin 'that shit about bonham's one hour drum solo .
one hour on drums?
you couldn't handle that shit on strong acid .
we're gonna go to the bathroom .
could you let miss wilk know?
all right .
this is totally amazing .
i voluntarily agree to not indulge in any alcohol , drugs or engage in any other illegal activity ... that may in any way jeopardize the years of hard work ... we as a team have committed to our goal ... of a championship season in '76 .
what bullshit .
guys are actually signing this crap?
apparently .
what are they gonna do next , give you guys urine tests?
i didn't know drugs and alcohol were such a big problem ... that they had to resort to neo mccarthyism .
they're just afraid some of us might be having too good a time .
it's the old age suppressing youth thing .
neo mccarthism .
i like that .
that's good , tommy .
and there you guys were in class trying to list all the gilligan's island episodes ... without even a hint of irony .
what the hell are you talkin 'about?
you weren't thinking about it , were you?
gilligan's island?
it's what's called a male pornographic fantasy .
oh my ...
think about it !
one a seductive sex goddess type , the other a healthy girl next door type with a nice butt .
so guys have it all ... the madonna and the whore .
women get nothing .
we get a geek , an overweight middle aged guy , some nerdy scientific type .
i mean ...
the professor is sexy .
pink !
come on , man .
we're off to raise some hell .
look at that !
let's go kick some ass !
hey , you guys .
you guys , wait up .

major bullshit .
he's a dead man .

shotgun !
check it out .
i been waitin 'three long years for this .
those junior high kids are dead meat .
i promise .
we're gonna beat 'em !
oh , yeah .
okay , you freshman fucks , listen up !
it's your lucky day .
usually you spend your freshman summer getting your asses busted ... and running for your worthless little lives .
but this year , because we feel so sorry for you , we're gonna take it easy on you ... and save us all a lot of time .
so if you meet here ... right here ... after school today , you'll only get one lick from each of us .
but you run like cowards , well , it's open season all summer long , boys .
oh , yeah , mitch kramer?
mitchie?
mitchie , mitchie , mitchie !
we're lookin 'for you , pal .
your ass'll be purple before the day is over .

hop on .
let's go , boy .
shit .
hey , coach .
so tell me .
any of you girls gonna be ready to play football this fall?
oh , yeah .
i don't know , coach .
i've been doing so good in english classes ,
i figured i'd become a writer .
what do you think about that?
you wouldn't know how to write your name if it wasn't stenciled on your locker .
seriously , everybody .
don't go getting soft on me this summer .
you're sitting around the pool all day , chasing the muff around .
break down !
uh !
hell , man .
my grandmother's quicker and tougher than you pansies .
course she's 6'3 " , 250 and runs a 4 . 540 .
what's the matter with you , floyd?
quarterbacks don't have to do what their coaches say?
dawson , did you give him that pledge sheet?
huh?
the pledge sheet .
did you give it to him?
yeah , coach , it's right here .
if you could get that to us by the end of the day , we'd feel a lot better .
you guys see that he does .
all right , coach .
randy floyd .
shit .
before next fall , you're in need of a serious attitude adjustment , young man .
you better get your priorities straight .
and watch out with that other crowd you're runnin 'with .
don't think i haven't noticed .
hey !
i want that piece of paper on my desk ... before you leave here today , do you hear me?
attitude adjustment .
you know what i mean?
priorities .
runs with that bad crowd !

i was waiting for one of them idiot coaches to piss me off again .
i think you take the whole thing too personally .
you just gotta ...
you gotta shake it off .
don , have you ever thought about why we play football?
how many times have you gotten laid strictly because you're a football player?
i don't know .
a few , probably .
a few?
all i'm sayin 'is ...
i bet we could do just as well if we were in a band or something .

every second that you could let us out early ... would really increase our chances of survival .
men !
fifty of you are leavin 'on a mission .
twenty five of ya ain't comin 'back .
okay .
the '68 democratic convention was probably ...
the most bitchin 'time i ever had in my life .
okay , guys , one more thing .
this summer when you're being inundated ... with all this american bicentennial fourth of july brouhaha , don't forget you're celebrating the fact ... that a bunch of slave owning , aristocratic , white males didn't want to pay their taxes .
yeah !

what's fascinating is the way not only the school , but the entire community , seems to be supporting this or turn their heads .
they apparently have permission to use the parking lot .
no parents seem to mind .
they're selling concessions .

we gave you all a chance .
but since you little prick teases can't follow instructions , we're just gonna have to try something else , won't we?

yeah , i know .
it's like it's all ... preparation .

# deep in the south of texas #
# not so long ago #
# there on a crowded island #
# in the gulf of mexico #
# it didn't take too much money #
# man , but it sure was nice #
# you could dance all night if you felt all right #
# drinkin 'whiskey and throwin 'dimes #
man , someone's tokin 'some reefer .
hey , man .
hey , slow down .
yeah , what?
what's up?
what'd you just say?
when?
just now , man , when you walked past .
what'd you say?
a about what?
you said , " someone's tokin 'some reefer .
no , i may have said somethin 'about smellin 'some pot .
it was just an observation .
oh , an observation , huh?
well , who the hell are you , man , isaac fuckin 'newton?
well , guess what , genius?
i'm the one smokin 'marijuana?
you got a problem with that?
no , of course not .
well , why'd you say that?
come on , man .
don't let your mouth write a check your butt can't cash .
i'm blazin 'with my friends , so i'm a fuckin 'pothead , man .
what's it to you , huh?
huh?
outta observations?
observe while i punch your teeth down your throat !
come on , dude , relax !
he's cool , man .
relax .
hey , i'll be watchin 'you , newton .
kick some ass and drink some beer .
looks like we're almost outta beer .
you okay , man?
yeah .
why's it called the moon tower?
uh , i guess they just decided to put it up here when they were buildin 'the power plant .
actually , it's a good idea .
i mean , you got a full moon out here every day of the year , you know?
yeah , but nothing's ever been repaired , so this whole place could fall down at any time .
so you better watch your step , junior .
whoa !
this place used to be off limits , man ,
'cause some drunk freshman fell off .
he went right down the middle , smackin 'his head on every beam , man .
i hear it doesn't hurt after the first couple , though .
autopsy said he had one beer , man .
how many'd you have?
four .
you're dead , man .
you're so dead .
look at the bloodstains right there .
shut up .
i'm gonna get that guy .
what guy?
that asshole on the way in .
clint .
that superdominant male in a '50s greaser uniform .
i wouldn't suggest that , mike .
most fights at places like this ... never get past a punch or two before they're broken up .
there's an almost natural instinct not to upset the herd .
so all i gotta do is get in one good punch , play defense and wait .
what?
what are you talking about?
at first , i was relieved to get out of the situation , but now there's this ...
level of humiliation setting in that's gonna be with me for fucking ever !
i'm not gonna let this be another situation which contributes to me being ... a little ineffectual nothing the rest of my life , you know?
would you look at this fucking town , man?
it's dead .
imagine how many people out there right now are fuckin ', man .
step inside my ...
just goin 'at it .
hey .
hey .
remember me?
sure .
you're sabrina , right?
right .
how ya doin '?

hey , let's go .
what brings you here?
oh , just hangin 'out .
you havin 'fun?
yeah .
yeah .
so , uh , does your offer from this afternoon still stand?
what am i supposed to say?
anything you want .
# do you , you #
# feel like i do # #
why'd we even come here?
i always feel a little out of place at these things , you know?
you're tellin 'me .
i'm being stalked by a nazi .
that a little bit of reefer i smell on you , boy?
coach is right .
you're running with that bad crowd again .
you've got an attitude adjustment you've gotta make right now .
like i'm the only athlete at this fuckin 'party .
coach is right , don .
those guys don't care if we win or lose .
just remember that .
check this out .
