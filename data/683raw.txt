harry , take my waist .
what?
now !
are you ready?
move your body like a hairy troll
learning to rock and roll
spin around like a crazy elf
dancing by himself
boogie down like a unicorn
no stopping till the break of dawn
put your hands up in the air
like an ogre who just don't care
can you dance like a hippogriff?
ruddy pumpkinhead , isn't he?
i don't think it was the books that had him going to the library .
may i have your arm?
arm .
leg .
i'm yours .
hot , isn't it?
viktor's gone to go and get drinks .
would you care to join us?
no , we'd not care to join you and viktor .
what's got your wand in a knot?
he's a durmstrang .
you're fraternizing with the enemy .
the enemy?
who was it wanting his autograph?
besides , the whole point of the tournament ... ... is international magical cooperation ... ... to make friends .
i think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind .
are you going to ask me to dance or not?
no .
he's using you .
how dare you? !
besides , i can take care of myself .
i doubt it .
he's way too old .
what? !
what?
that's what you think?
yeah , that's what i think .
you know the solution then , don't you?
go on .
next time there's a ball ... ... pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does !
and not as a last resort .
well , that's ...
i mean , that's just completely off the point .
harry .
where have you been?
never mind !
off to bed , both of you .
they get scary when they get older .
ron , you spoiled everything !
what's this about?
no , don't let
this magic die
the answer's there
let me see it again .
yes , the time is close now .
harry , at last !
step aside , wormtail , so i can give our guest a proper greeting .
you all right , harry?
i just got in .
me .
harry , you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago .
the task is two days from now .
really?
i had no idea .
i suppose viktor's already figured it out .
wouldn't know .
we don't actually talk about the tournament .
actually , we don't really talk at all .
viktor's more of a physical being .
i just mean he's not particularly loquacious .
mostly , he watches me study .
it's a bit annoying , actually .
you are trying to figure this egg out , aren't you?
what's that supposed to mean?
it just means these tasks are designed to test you ... ... in the most brutal way .
they're almost cruel .
and ... ... l'm scared for you .
you got by the dragons mostly on nerve .
i'm not sure it's going to be enough this time .
hey , potter !
potter !
cedric .
how ...?
how are you?
spectacular .
i realize i never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons .
forget it .
i'm sure you would've done the same for me .
exactly .
you know the prefects 'bathroom on the fifth floor?
it's not a bad place for a bath .
just take your egg ... ... and mull things over in the hot water .
i must be out of my mind .
i'm definitely out of my mind .
i'd try putting it in the water if i were you .
myrtle !
hello , harry .
long time no see .
i was circling a blocked drain the other day ... ... and could swear i saw a bit of polyjuice potion .
not being a bad boy again , are you , harry?
polyjuice potion?
kicked the habit .
myrtle , did you say , " try putting it in the water "?
that's what he did .
the other boy ... ... the handsome one ... ... cedric .
well , go on .
open it .
come seek us where our voices sound
we cannot sing above the ground
an hour long you'll have to look
to recover what we took
myrtle ... ... there aren't merpeople in the black lake , are there?
very good .
it took cedric ages to riddle it out .
almost all the bubbles were gone .
harry , tell me again .
come seek us where our voices sound .
the black lake , that's obvious .
an hour long you'll have to look .
again , obvious .
though , admittedly , potentially problematic .
potentially problematic "?
when's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour , hermione?
look , harry , we can do this .
the three of us can figure it out .
hate to break up the skull session .
professor mcgonagall wants you in her office .
not you , potter , just weasley and granger .
but , sir , the second task is only hours away , and ...
exactly .
presumably potter is well prepared by now ... ... and could do with a good night's sleep .
go .
now !
longbottom !
why don't you help potter put his books back .
you know , if you're interested in plants ... ... you'd be better off with goshawk's guide to herbology .
do you know there's a wizard in nepal who's growing gravity resistant trees?
neville , no offense , but i really don't care ... ... about plants .
now , if there's ... ... a tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour ... ... then great .
but otherwise ...
i don't know about a turnip .
but you could always use gillyweed .
any bets?
any bets?
come on , place your bets !
step up , mates !
don't be shy .
three lads .
one lady .
four go down .
but do four come up?
don't be so mean .
any bets?
fleur's 10 1 .
you're sure about this , neville?
absolutely .
for an hour?
most likely .
most likely?
well , there is some debate among herbologists ... ... as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water ...
you're telling me this now?
you must be joking !
i just wanted to help .
well , that makes you a right sight better than ron and hermione .
where are they anyway?
you seem a little tense , harry .
do i?
welcome to the second task .
last night , something was stolen from each of our champions .
a treasure of sorts .
these four treasures , one for each champion ... ... now lie on the bottom of the black lake .
in order to win ... ... each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface .
put that in your mouth .
they will have but one hour to do so , and one hour only .
after that , they'll be on their own .
no magic will save them .
you may begin at the sound of the cannon .
what's the matter with him?
i don't know , i can't see him .
oh , my god .
i've killed harry potter .
yeah !
what?
the beauxbatons champion , miss delacour ... ... has unfortunately been forced to retire ... ... so she will take no further part in this task .
but she's my friend too !
only one !
let's get down below .
krum !
krum !
krum !
yes !
ascendio !
harry !
he's all right .
he's all right .
barty !
go get him another towel .
i want all the judges over here now !
you saved her , even though she wasn't yours to save .
my little sister .
thank you .
and you !
you helped .
well , yeah , a bit .
harry !
hermione !
are you all right?
you must be freezing .
personally , i think you behaved admirably .
i finished last , hermione .
next to last .
fleur never got past the grindylows .
krum !
krum !
krum !
come on !
come on !
attention !
attention !
the winner is mr. diggory ... ... who showed innate command of the bubble head charm .
however , seeing as mr. potter would have finished first ... ... had it not been for his determination to rescue not only mr. weasley ... ... but the others as well , we've agreed to award him ... ... second place ...
second place !
well done ! ... for outstanding moral fiber !
yes !
right on .
all that moral fiber , eh?
it's great .
moral fiber?
blimey .
even when you go wrong , it turns out right .
yeah , well done , moral fiber .
congratulations , potter .
a fine achievement .
thank you .
well done , boy .
see you at hagrid's , harry .
i'm sorry we haven't spoken .
after all , your story is one i've heard so many times .
quite remarkable , really .
tragic , of course ... ... to lose one's family .
never whole again , are we?
still , life goes on ... ... and here we stand .
i'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today , potter .
bartemius !
not trying to lure potter into one of the ministry's summer internships , are we?
the last boy who went into the department of mysteries never came out !
and they say i'm mad .
now , i remember ...
i remember when i first met you all .
biggest bunch of misfits i ever set eyes on .
suppose you remind me of meself a little .
and here we all are , four years later .
we're still a bunch of misfits .
well , maybe , but we've all got each other .
and harry , of course .
soon to be the youngest triwizard champion there's ever been !
hooray !
hogwarts , hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts
teach us something , please
mr. crouch?
a man has died here , fudge .
and he won't be the last .
you must take action .
i will not .
in times like these , the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength , dumbledore !
then for once show them some !
the triwizard tournament will not be canceled .
i will not be seen as a coward !
a true leader does what is right , no matter what others think .
what did you say to me?
excuse me , gentlemen .
it may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private .
oh , harry !
harry , how good to see you again .
i can come back later , professor .
not necessary , harry .
the minister and i are done .
i'll be back in a moment .
minister , after you .
there you are .
your hat .
oh , harry , do feel free to indulge in a little licorice snap in my absence .
but i have to warn you , they're a wee bit sharp .
professor?
professor .
yeah .
igor karkaroff , you have been brought from azkaban at your own request ... ... to present evidence to this council .
should your testimony prove consequential ... ... council may be prepared to order your immediate release .
until such time , you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted death eater .
do you accept these terms?
i do , sir .
and what do you wish to present?
i have names , sir .
there was rosier , evan rosier .
rosier is dead .
he took a piece of me with him ... ... though , didn't he?
i didn't know .
lf that is all the witness has to offer ...
no , no , no .
there was rookwood !
he was a spy .
augustus rookwood?
of the department of mysteries?
yeah , the same .
he passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself .
very well .
council will deliberate .
in the meantime , you will return to azkaban .
no !
wait !
wait , please !
please , i have more !
what about snape?
severus snape?
as the council is aware , i've given evidence on this matter .
severus snape was indeed a death eater and , prior to lord voldemort's downfall ... ... turned spy for us at great personal risk .
it's a lie !
today he's no more a death eater than i am .
snape remains faithful to the dark lord !
silence !
unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence ... ... this session is now concluded .
oh , no , no , no .
i've heard about one more .
what's that?
the name .
yes?
i know for a fact ... ... this person took part in the capture ... ... and , by means of the cruciatus curse ... ... torture of the auror frank longbottom and his wife !
the name .
give me the wretched name !
barty crouch ... ... junior .
hold him down !
get your filthy hands off me , you pathetic little men !
hello , father .
you are no son of mine .
curiosity is not a sin , harry .
but you should exercise caution .
it's a pensieve .
very useful if , like me , you find your mind a wee bit stretched .
it allows me to see once more things i've already seen .
you see , harry , i have searched and searched for something ... ... some small detail ... ... something i might have overlooked ... ... something that would explain why these terrible things have happened .
every time i get close to an answer , it slips away .
it's maddening .
sir?
mr. crouch's son .
what exactly happened to him?
he was sent to azkaban .
destroyed barty to do it .
but he had no choice .
the evidence was overwhelming .
why do you ask?
it's just that i ...
i had a dream about him .
it was in the summer , before school .
in the dream , i was in a house .
and voldemort was there , only he wasn't quite human .
and wormtail was there too .
and mr. crouch's son .
have there been others like this dream?
yes .
always the same one .
sir , these dreams ... ... what i see , you don't think it's actually happening , do you?
i think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams , harry .
i think it's best if you simply ...
... cast them away .
it's a sign , severus .
you know what it means as well as i.
potter !
what's your hurry?
congratulations , your performance in the black lake was inspiring .
gillyweed , am i correct?
yes , sir .
ingenious .
a rather rare herb , gillyweed .
not something found in your everyday garden .
nor is this .
know what it is?
bubble juice , sir?
veritaserum .
three drops of this and you know who himself would spill his darkest secrets .
the use of it on a student is , regrettably , forbidden .
however ... ... should you ever steal from my personal stores again ... ... my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice .
i haven't stolen anything .
don't lie to me .
gillyweed may be innocuous , but boomslang skin , lacewing flies?
you and your little friends are brewing polyjuice potion , and believe me ... ... l'm going to find out why !
yeah !
yeah !
sonorus !
earlier today , professor moody placed the triwizard cup deep within the maze .
only he knows its exact position .
now , as mr. diggory ... ... and mr. potter ... ... are tied for first position ... ... they will be the first to enter the maze , followed by mr. krum ... ... and miss delacour .
come on !
krum !
krum !
krum !
the first person to touch the cup will be the winner !
i've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter .
should , at any point , a contestant wish to withdraw from the task ... ... he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands .
contestants !
gather around .
quickly !
in the maze , you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep .
instead , you'll face something even more challenging .
you see , people change in the maze .
oh , find the cup if you can .
but be very wary , you could just lose yourselves along the way .
champions , prepare yourselves !
good luck .
my boy .
see you later , dad .
on the count of three .
one ...
fleur?
fleur .
periculum !
get down !
get down !
expelliarmus !
no , don't !
stop !
he's bewitched , cedric !
get off me !
he's bewitched !
yes .
harry !
harry !
harry !
harry !
reducto !
thanks .
no problem .
you know , for a moment there , i thought you were gonna let it get me .
for a moment , so did i.
some game , huh?
some game .
go !
go on , take it .
you saved me , take it !
together .
one , two ...
two ... ... three ! ... three !
you okay?
yeah .
you?
where are we?
i've been here before .
it's a portkey .
harry , the cup is a portkey .
i've been here before , in a dream .
cedric !
we have to get back to the cup .
now !
what are you talking about?
harry !
what is it?
get back to the cup !
who are you?
what do you want?
kill the spare .
avada kedavra !
no !
cedric !
do it !
now !
bone of the father ... ... unwillingly given .
flesh of the servant ... ... willingly sacrificed .
and blood of the enemy ...
... forcibly taken .
the dark lord shall rise ... ... again .
my wand , wormtail .
hold out your arm .
master .
thank you , master .
the other arm , wormtail .
welcome , my friends .
thirteen years it's been , and yet ... ... here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday .
i confess myself ... ... disappointed .
not one of you tried to find me .
crabbe !
macnair !
goyle !
not even you ...
... lucius .
my lord , had i detected any sign , a whisper of your whereabouts ...
there were signs , my slippery friend .
and more than whispers .
i assure you , my lord , i have never renounced the old ways .
the face i have been obliged to present each day since your absence ... ... that is my true mask .
i returned .
out of fear , not loyalty .
still , you have proved yourself useful these past few months , wormtail .
thank you , master .
thank you .
such a handsome boy .
don't touch him !
harry .
i'd almost forgotten you were here .
standing on the bones of my father .
yeah .
i'd introduce you ... ... but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days .
the boy who lived .
how lies have fed your legend , harry .
shall i reveal what really happened that night 13 years ago?
shall i divulge how i truly lost my powers?
yes , shall i?
it was love .
you see , when dear , sweet lily potter gave her life for her only son ... ... she provided the ultimate protection .
i could not touch him .
it was old magic .
something i should have foreseen .
but no matter , no matter .
things have changed .
i can touch you ... ... now .
yeah .
astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do , eh , harry?
pick up your wand , potter .
i said , pick it up !
get up !
get up !
you've been taught how to duel , i presume , yes?
first , we bow to each other .
come on , now , harry .
the niceties must be observed .
dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners , would he?
i said , bow .
that's better .
and now ...
no .
crucio !
crucio !
attaboy , harry .
your parents would be proud .
especially your filthy muggle mother .
expelliar ...
i'm going to kill you , harry potter .
i'm going to destroy you .
after tonight , no one will ever again question my powers .
after tonight , if they speak of you ... ... they'll speak only of how you ... ... begged for death .
and i , being a merciful lord ... ... obliged .
get up !
don't you turn your back on me , harry potter !
i want you to look at me when i kill you !
i want to see the light leave your eyes !
have it your way .
expelliarmus !
avada kedavra !
do nothing !
he's mine to finish !
he's mine !
harry , when the connection is broken , you must get to the portkey .
we can linger for a moment to give you some time ... ... but only a moment .
do you understand?
harry , take my body back , will you?
take my body back to my father .
let go .
sweetheart , you're ready .
let go !
let go !
accio !
no !
he did it !
harry !
harry !
no !
no !
no , don't !
for god's sake , dumbledore , what's happened?
he's back .
he's back .
voldemort's back .
cedric , he asked me to bring his body back .
i couldn't leave him , not there .
it's all right , harry .
it's all right .
he's home .
you both are .
keep everybody in their seats .
a boy has just been killed .
the body must be moved , dumbledore .
there are too many people .
let me through .
let me through !
let me through !
that's my son !
that's my boy !
it's my boy !
come on .
get up .
easy , easy !
no .
this is not where you want to be right now .
come on .
no !
it's all right , i got you .
i got you .
come on .
easy , now .
no !
no !
are you all right , potter?
does it hurt?
that?
not so much now .
perhaps i'd better take a look at it .
the cup was a portkey .
someone had bewitched it .
what was it like?
what was he like?
who?
the dark lord .
what was it like to stand in his presence?
i don't know .
it was like i'd fallen into one of my dreams ... ... into one of my nightmares .
were there others?
in the graveyard , were there others?
i ...
i don't think i said anything about a graveyard , professor .
marvelous creatures , dragons , aren't they?
did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods ... ... if i hadn't suggested it?
do you think cedric diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater ... ... if i hadn't told him first myself?
did you think neville longbottom , the witless wonder ... ... could've provided you with gillyweed if i hadn't given him the book ... ... that led him straight to it?
it was you from the beginning .
you put my name in the goblet of fire .
you bewitched krum , but you ...
" but ...
but ...
you won because i made it so , potter .
you ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so .
and now the deed is done .
the blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord .
imagine how he will reward me when he learns ... ... that i have once and for all ... ... silenced the great harry potter .
expelliarmus !
severus .
that's it , take it .
do you know who i am?
albus dumbledore .
are you alastor moody?
are you?
no .
is he in this room?
is he in this room?
harry , away from there !
you all right , alastor?
i'm sorry , albus .
that's moody .
but then who's ...?
polyjuice potion .
now we know who's been stealing from your stores , severus .
we'll get you up in a minute .
harry !
barty crouch junior .
i'll show you mine if you show me yours .
your arm , harry .
you know what this means , don't you?
he's back .
lord voldemort has returned .
i'm sorry , sir .
i couldn't help it .
send an owl to azkaban .
i think they'll find they're missing a prisoner .
i'll be welcomed back like a hero .
perhaps .
personally , i've never had much time for heroes .
today , we acknowledge ... ... a really terrible loss .
cedric diggory was , as you all know ... ... exceptionally hard working ... ... infinitely fair minded ... ... and , most importantly ... ... a fierce , fierce friend .
now , i think , therefore , you have the right to know exactly how he died .
you see ... ... cedric diggory was murdered ... ... by lord voldemort !
the ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this .
but not to do so , i think , would be an insult to his memory .
now , the pain ... ... we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me ... ... and reminds us ... ... that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues ... ... our hearts beat as one .
in light of recent events ... ... the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be more important than ever .
remember that , and cedric diggory will not have died in vain .
you remember that ... ... and we'll celebrate a boy who was ... ... kind and honest ... ... and brave and true , right to the very end .
i never liked these curtains .
set them on fire in my fourth year .
by accident , of course .
i put you in terrible danger this year , harry .
i'm sorry .
professor ... ... when i was in the graveyard , there was a moment ... ... when voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected .
priori incantatem .
you saw your parents that night , didn't you?
they reappeared .
no spell can reawaken the dead , harry .
i trust you know that .
dark and difficult times lie ahead .
soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy .
you have friends here .
you're not alone .
hermione .
this is for you .
write to me .
promise .
bye .
au revoir , ron .
do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at hogwarts?
no .
no .
no , i didn't think so .
oh , well .
what's life without a few dragons?
everything's going to change now , isn't it?
yes .
promise you'll write this summer .
both of you .
i won't .
you know i won't .
harry will , won't you?
yeah .
every week .
