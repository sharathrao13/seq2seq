we'll get one down the road .
hurry .
for god's sake , harold , can we please get a taxi?
i'm trying to get a ....
taxi !
we're going the wrong way !
jimmy , put that away .
we look like tourists .
let's cut over to seventh .
seventh is that way .
i know where we are !
hey , give me a dollar .
how about it?
one dollar .
are you deaf?
you don't speak english?
come on !
up here .
hey , lady ... ... do the kid a favor .
don't scream .
hey , all right !
american express card .
don't leave home without it .
get out of here .
i don't like it up here .
are you scared of heights?
i don't know .
after what happened to johnny gobs
look , johnny gobs got ripped and took a walk off a roof .
no big loss .
that ain't what i heard at all .
i heard that the bat got him .
the bat?
give me a break , will you?
five stories .
straight down .
there wasn't no blood in the body .
no shit .
it was all over the pavement .
i'm getting out of here .
shut up .
listen to me .
there ain't no bat .
you shouldn't have turned the gun on that kid .
you want your cut of this money or not?
now shut up !
shut up !
don't kill me !
don't kill me !
don't kill me !
don't kill me !
i won't kill you .
i want you to do me a favor .
tell all your friends about me .
what are you?
i'm batman .
across this nation ... ... the words " gotham city " are synonymous with crime .
our streets are overrun , our public officials are helpless .
as mayor , i promise to root out the source of this corruption ... ... boss carl grissom .
now , our new district attorney , harvey dent ... ... will carry out that promise .
thank you , mayor borg .
thank you .
people of gotham city ... ... i'm a man of few words .
but those words will count , and so will my actions .
commissioner gordon informs me ... ... that he has targeted those businesses ... ... suspected of fronting for the syndicate in this city .
before this week is out ... ... we are going to knock down their doors ... ... and shed the light of the law on that nest of vipers .
together , we can make this city safe for decent people .
decent people shouldn't live here .
they'd be happier someplace else .
pretty tough talk about carl .
forget about it .
if this clown could touch grissom , i'd have handed him his lungs by now .
if grissom knew about us ... ... he might hand you something .
don't flatter yourself , angel .
he's a tired old man .
he can't run this city without me .
and besides ... ... he doesn't know .
you don't worry about anything , do you , jack?
you look fine .
i didn't ask .
yeah .
hanging on .
let me guess .
giant , menacing , supernatural form .
kind of like a bat .
that's it .
what are they seeing up there?
they're drinking drano .
it's weird .
thanks for the tip .
christ .
knox .
lieutenant , i hear we had another bat attack .
that's eight sightings in a month .
i hear the commissioner's opened a file .
sorry , knox .
these two slipped on a banana peel .
i'm telling you , a giant bat !
don't write about this .
it will ruin your already useless reputation .
lieutenant , every punk in this town is scared .
they say he can't be killed .
they say he drinks blood .
i say you're full of shit , knox .
you can quote me on that .
is there a six foot bat in gotham city?
is he on the police payroll?
what's he pulling down , after taxes?
brought you a little snack , eckhardt .
why don't you broadcast it?
shut up and listen .
harvey dent has been sniffing around one of our front companies .
that's my territory .
if there's a problem , i deal with it .
your problems are our problems .
i answer to grissom , not to psychos .
you ought to think about the future .
you mean when you run the show?
you got no future , jack .
you're an a 1 nut boy , and grissom knows it .
better be sure .
see?
you can make a good decision when you try .
where've you been spending your nights?
i don't care if this festival is in debt , i want a parade .
i want hot dogs , balloons , everything .
we'll celebrate this 200th anniversary proudly and publicly .
we may celebrate in bankruptcy court .
it's $250, 000 in debt and we haven't seen one balloon .
you fill the square with people , and businesses will come back .
a lot of people may stay away .
they're scared .
they won't be scared when you get grissom in the courthouse .
i promised that , remember?
welcome , count dracula .
had any sightings of big foot lately?
they buried your story on batman .
they bury garbage .
this is pulitzer prize stuff .
i got something for you .
very funny .
you should have put more gore under the fangs .
what a dick .
hello , legs .
i'm reading your stuff .
well , i'm reading yours .
hi , i'm vicki vale .
yeah , photographer .
vogue , cosmo .
yeah .
if you want me to pose nude , you'll need a long lens .
actually , i was in the corto maltese .
you could get hurt doing this stuff .
what brings you here?
i'm here to see the wildlife in gotham city .
wildlife?
mm hmm .
like what?
like ... bats .
who sent you?
nobody , really .
i just loved your story , and ... ... l like bats .
yeah?
my pictures , your words .
pulitzer prize material .
just think .
okay , you're a visionary , and also the only one who believes me .
i need something tangible .
gordon's got a file .
i can't even get him on the phone .
he'll be at bruce wayne's benefit , right?
yeah .
i don't seem to be on the guest list .
no .
yes , yes .
vale , will you marry me?
no .
buy me lunch?
maybe .
i eat light .
say this ... ... son of a bitch ... ... makes a connection with us and with axis chemicals .
what kind of damage are we looking at?
if he ties us with axis chemicals , we're dead and buried .
we should move immediately .
i say we break into the place ... ... trash the office ... ... and make off with the records and say it was industrial espionage .
jack ....
smart thinking .
that's the way to go .
in fact ... ... i'd like you to handle this operation personally .
me?
hello , sweetheart .
would you mind waiting in the next room?
that's all , gentlemen .
thank you .
that's all .
carl ....
can somebody else do this?
the fumes in that place ....
jack ....
it's an important job .
i need ... ... someone i can trust .
you ... are my number one guy .
now ... ... don't forget ... ... your lucky deck .
my friend ... ... your luck is about to change .
police department .
get me lieutenant eckhardt .
can i help you , sir?
oh , thanks .
thank you very much .
that's very nice of you .
here you go .
good evening .
a little crowded .
excuse me .
excuse me .
could you tell me who is bruce wayne?
i'm not sure .
thanks anyway .
eight .
i can make that eight .
i can make that eight .
commissioner !
mrs. gordon , you look lovely .
is it true the commissioner has a file on the batman?
there is no bat .
if there were , we would find and arrest him .
be straight with me , commissioner .
how're you making out?
mr. dent , i love that tie .
we were discussing winged vigilantes .
what's your stand?
we have enough problems in this city ... ... without worrying about ghosts .
pardon me , but that's not a denial .
excuse me , i'll be back .
won't anybody go on record?
your honor , great suit .
no comment .
robert , what's up?
anonymous tip .
napier's cleaning out axis chemicals .
why wasn't i told?
who's in charge?
eckhardt .
oh , my god !
come on , let's go .
mr. gordon?
mr. gordon?
wait , wait .
living room , dining room , arsenal .
look at this stuff .
who is this guy?
he gives to humanitarian causes , and then collects all this stuff .
he probably does it to get chicks .
they like his charity balls .
don't leave out his very large bankroll .
the more they've got , the less they're worth .
this guy must be the most worthless guy in america .
check this out .
he must have been the king of the wicker people .
where'd this come from?
i have no idea .
it's japanese .
how do you know?
i bought it in japan .
who are you?
sorry .
bruce wayne .
alexander knox .
i read your work .
i like it a lot .
thanks .
can i have a grant?
vicki vale .
hi .
bruce wayne .
are you sure?
yeah .
i've seen your pictures from corto maltese , haven't l?
you've got a wonderful eye .
some people think she has two .
this is an amazing house .
i'd like to shoot it sometime .
mr. wayne , we need more champagne .
is that all right?
sure .
go ahead .
how many cases?
six?
six?
six is good .
six .
thanks .
will you be in gotham for a while?
i'd love to .
i'm intrigued by alex's " giant bat " stories .
oh , right .
the bat ....
batman .
a bit light after the war in corto maltese , no?
what do you do for a living?
commissioner gordon was compelled to leave .
very unexpectedly , sir .
will you two excuse me?
i think perhaps this way , sir .
they need wine in the front room , and a mrs. daley needs a copy of the menu .
and give knox a grant .
nice talking with you , wayne .
the rich ....
know why they're so odd?
they can afford to be .
look at this mirror .
maybe it should be bruce vain .
what's up?
anonymous tip .
napier's cleaning out axis chemicals .
gordon : if we could get him , we'd have grissom .
why wasn't i told?
who's in charge?
eckhardt .
oh , my god !
come on , let's go .
take a good look .
this is the guy .
get a good look .
shoot to kill .
you know what i mean?
let's move out .
we've been ratted out , boys .
watch it .
freeze !
you take the right .
move it .
what the hell's going on?
what are you trying to do?
i'm in charge , not carl grissom .
this is commissioner gordon . i want him taken alive . i repeat .
any man who opens fire on jack napier will answer to me .
let me down !
let me down !
let me down !
oh , my god !
get up on the catwalk , on that side .
you take that side .
be very careful .
jesus !
let him go ... or i'll do gordon .
nice outfit .
come on , jack , let's go !
come on !
eckhardt !
think about the future .
goddamn it , we had him !
hold it right there !
who is this guy?
i don't know .
until we find out , keep a lid on it .
if there's no bat , then who dropped napier into the acid?
suicide?
i want to get this on tape .
hello?
he hung up .
what have you got?
here's the inner city .
here's the sightings so far .
maybe batman has some sort of flight pattern .
this is very good .
tonight we'll go to dinner , then we'll walk the trail .
no can do .
i got a date .
bruce wayne .
wayne !
wayne !
oh , no !
the guy's a stiff .
you could do much better .
thanks for being so concerned .
bye .
how's the soup?
excuse me?
the soup .
how is it?
it's great .
could you pass the salt?
sure .
did you have trouble finding the house?
no ....
it was no problem .
good .
do you like eating in here?
oh , yeah .
i don't think i've been in this room before .
you want to leave?
yes .
there was young master bruce ... ... leading his gray pony with me on its back ... ... like a sack of old potatoes , covered in mud and nursing a sprained ankle .
that was the first and last time i gave him a riding lesson .
i think i've embarrassed him for long enough .
i'm off to bed .
please , leave everything .
i'll tidy up in the morning .
good night , miss .
good night , alfred .
good night , sir .
good night , alfred .
he's really wonderful .
he loves you a lot .
alfred's great .
i couldn't find my socks without him .
he reminds me of my grandfather .
were you close to him?
i used to spend summers with him and my grandmother .
they had a house on the lake .
nothing like this , but ... ... it was fun .
that sounds nice .
yeah .
what about your family?
actually , alfred is my family .
this house and all this stuff doesn't seem like you at all .
some of it is very much me .
some isn't .
that dining room is definitely not you .
the dining room isn't .
let's see how we did .
oh , my god !
mirror .
mirror !
you understand that the nerves were completely severed , mr. napier .
you see what i have to work with here .
there are an awful lot of stairs in this place .
my feet are killing me .
i feel a little drunk .
and you're not anything .
one drink and i'm flying .
why are you afraid of flying?
that you , sugar bumps?
who are you?
it's me .
sugar bumps .
you're alive !
i heard you'd been
fried?
is that what you heard?
you set me up over a woman .
a woman !
you must be insane .
don't bother .
your life won't be worth spit !
i've been dead once already .
it's very liberating ... ... if you think of it as ... therapy .
jack , listen .
maybe we can cut a deal .
jack?
jack is dead , my friend .
you can call me ... ... joker .
as you can see ... ... i'm a lot happier .
oh , what a day .
gotham city .
it always brings a smile to my face .
winged freak ... " ... terrorizes ....
wait'll they get a load of me .
oooh ....
i've got an idea .
how about lunch at my place?
i'll show you some photos .
sure .
okay .
wait a minute .
no , i can't .
i can't make it .
okay , we'll do it later in the day .
i can't make it then , either .
i've got a very important meeting today .
what's wrong?
nothing .
i have to leave town for a few days .
okay , we'll do it when you get back .
all right .
i have to go .
i'm late .
bye .
nice to see you again , ma'am .
nice to see you , too .
i'll talk to you guys when you get back .
back , miss vale?
we'll be here for quite a while .
well , bye .
honey ....
you'll never believe what happened to me today .
so , gentlemen , that's how it is .
until grissom ... resurfaces ... ... i'm the acting president .
and i say , starting with this anniversary festival ... ... we run this city into the ground .
why don't we hear this from grissom?
yeah .
and what's with that stupid grin?
life's been good to me .
what if we say " no "?
well , tony ....
nobody wants a war .
if we can't do business , we'll just shake hands and that'll be it .
yeah?
yeah .
i got a live one here .
there'll be a hot time in the old town tonight .
antoine got a little hot under the collar .
you're crazy .
haven't you ever heard of the healing power of laughter?
now get out of here !
let's go !
move it !
you think it over .
go to the globe , follow that reporter knox .
take your camera .
see what he knows about this batman .
and , bob ...
... remember ... you ... ... are my number one ... ... guy .
yes , sir .
your pals ... ... they're not bad people .
maybe we ... ... ought to give them a few days to think it over .
no?
grease them now?
okay .
you are a vicious bastard , rotelli .
i'm glad you're dead .
i'm glad you're dead .
i'm glad you're dead .
i need that .
i'm losing confidence in you .
i thought we were a team .
is this a personal issue for you?
i just want you to do your job .
i am doing my job .
and i'm protecting my partner .
there's nothing in these files .
who is this guy?
who cares?
forget bruce wayne .
i'm onto batman .
they'll be out any second .
i can't wait to hear the explanation .
what is this affidavit you filed?
grissom gave you his business?
mr. grissom asked me , as a personal favor ... ... to take over all his businesses until he returns .
that's a big favor .
you two must have been very close .
did you do time together as children?
our accountants are looking into it .
the affidavit is legitimate .
i smell fresh ink .
you can prove this?
of course you can .
we have witnesses .
grissom's signature is legitimate .
it is legitimate .
i saw it .
i was there .
i saw it all .
he reached up with his dead hand ... ... and signed it in his own blood .
and he did it ... with this pen .
hello , vinnie .
it's your uncle bingo .
time to pay the check .
the pen ... ... is truly mightier than the sword .
get down !
won't this gang war dampen the city's 200th anniversary?
the festival opens .
the police will stop these gangsters .
what about the theory that the batman is a mob enforcer? i don't have any comment .
batman .
batman .
can somebody tell me what kind of a world we live in ... ... when a man dressed as a bat ... ... gets all my press?
this town needs an enema !
may i have a glass of ... water?
i'm relieved that you're home .
miss vale telephoned .
she was rather concerned .
i feel there's a certain weight that lifts when she is here .
alfred ... ... why don't you marry her?
that's not exactly what i had in mind , sir .
i can't go on with that right now .
if not now ... ... when?
i don't know .
jack napier's still alive .
he's running grissom's men .
i need any information on him .
yes , sir .
thank you .
alfred ....
she is great , isn't she?
yes .
knox .
hi .
check something out for me .
find out what's special about the alley at pearl and phillips .
pearl and phillips?
yeah .

okay .
okay , bye .
mr. wayne .
so much to do and so little time .
the photos .
who's that loss?
knox .
bad tie .
no style .
stop the press !
who is that?
vicki vale .
the photographer working with knox .
that girl has style .
jesus marimba !
a lovely beast like that running around ... ... could put steam in a man's strides .
she's dating some guy named wayne .
she's about to trade up .
it's hard to stay inside the lines .
i'm about ... ... to get a new girl , bobby .
i'm of a mind to make some mooky .
phone book .
yes , sir .
so much to do ... ... and so little time .

yes , sir .

ten seconds to transmission .
five ... four ... three ... two ... one .
cue music .

chemistry .
let's go shopping .
yes , sir .
... six new deaths , with no clues as to the joker's deadly weapon .
and what is the pattern?
foods , alcohol , or beauty and hygiene products?
cologne , mouthwash , underarm deodorant?
or worse yet , there may be no pattern .
the search goes on through gotham's shopping nightmare .
we are having a festival , if i have to use a gun to get people there myself .

terence , brush .
all hail the new king in town
young and old , gather 'round
black and white , red and green
the funkiest man you've ever seen

partyman , partyman
rock a party like nobody can
rules and regulations no place in this nation
partyman , partyman
party people say it now
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
the one dollar bill .
somebody holler if you wanna party
hold it !
i kind of like this one .
leave it .
you can take that off now .
you're beautiful ... in an old fashioned kind of way .
but i'm sure we can make you more ... today .
your portfolio?
i'm meeting someone who wants to see my work .
crap .
crap .
crap .
crap .
crap .
now that's good work .
the skulls , the bodies .
you give it such a glow .
i don't know if it's art , but i like it .
let me tell you what i'm thinking about .
i was in the bath one day ... ... when i realized why i was destined for greatness .
you know how concerned people are about appearances .
this is attractive , that is not .
that is all behind me .
i now do what other people only dream .
i make art ... until someone dies .
see?
i am the world's first fully functioning homicidal artist .
what do you want?
my face on the one dollar bill .
you're joking .
do i look like i'm joking?
no .
listen .
we mustn't compare ourselves to regular people .
we're artists .
for instance , let me challenge you with a piece i did .
bob .
alicia .
you will photograph and record my work .
you will join me in the avant garde of the new aesthetic .
jack , you said i could watch you improve the paintings .
i'm in trouble now .
why is she wearing a mask?
she's just a sketch , really .
alicia , sit down .
show the lady why you wear this mask .
alicia's been made over in line with my new philosophy .
so now , like me ... ... she is a living work of art .
i'm no picasso , but ... do you like it?
it's great .
so ... what can i do for you?
a little song , a little dance .
batman's head on a lance .
what do you know about ...?
i don't know anything about batman .
really?
well , how about a little " you and me "?
you're insane .
i thought i was a pisces .
come on .
let's make up .
have a little ... ... whiff of my posy .
help me !
i'm melting !
i'm melting !
help me !
i'm melting !
hold on .
where does he get those wonderful toys?
get in the car .
which one?
let's go .
shields .
how much do you weigh?
about 108 , i think .
hold on .
grab that thing on my belt .
don't let go .
no blood .
who is this guy?
check his wallet .
wait .
what is that?
some kind of body armor .
he's human after all .
take off the mask .
shoot her !
shields open .
you weigh more than 108 .
really?
let's go .
stop .
where are we going?
be careful .
bats .
they're great survivors .
what is all this?
the police have got it wrong .
they're looking for one product .
the joker's tainted hundreds of chemicals at the source .
then whole shipments would be poisoned .
and we'd all be dead .
no .
the poison only works if the components are mixed .
hairspray won't do it alone .
but hairspray mixed with lipstick and perfume will be toxic , and traceable .
how did you figure this out?
take that to the press .
i might have trouble with that .
a lot of people think you're as dangerous as the joker .
he's psychotic .
some people say the same thing about you .
what people?
well , let's face it .
you're not exactly normal ... are you?
it's not exactly a normal world .
why did you bring me here?
you could have sent that stuff to the press yourself .
you're right .
there is something else you have that i want .
what?
he took the film .
yeah?
where have you been?
are you okay?
should i come over?
no , allie .
if i bring something to you , can we make the evening edition?
just barely .
is it hot?
yeah , it's real hot .
yeah , bye .
copy !
deodorants with baby powder , hairspray , and lipstick .
safe products are flying in as gotham city goes on a forced fast .
and all of gotham is wondering what to make of batman .
friend or foe?
i have given a name to my pain ... ... and it is batman .
you must possess strength to inflict pain , bob .
we've got a flying mouse to kill ... ... and i want to clean my claws .
sir , miss vale called again .
dare i suggest that your present course of action ... ... might simply strengthen her resolve?
she is quite tenacious .
you're right .
and quite special .
perhaps you could try telling her the truth .
coming .
hi .
may i come in?
this is a nice apartment .
lots of space .
listen , i came over to ...
... clear  i don't know who you think you are !
you hurt me .
i know .
i called you and called you .
and you lied !
you lied about leaving town .
let me tell you why .
let me tell you !
i thought we felt something .
and i trusted you .
i even slept with you .
then you wouldn't return my calls .
you must be some kind of jerk .
you're a real nice girl and i like you a lot , but right now , shut up .
i have something to tell you .
you know how people have ... different sides to their personality?
uh huh .
sometimes ... ... a person will have to actually lead a different life .
oh , my god , you're married .
no , i'm not married .
you see ... ... my life is really ...
... complex .
all right , listen .
you know how a normal person gets up and ... ... goes downstairs ... ... and eats breakfast ... ... and kisses somebody good bye , and goes to ... ... a job , and , you know ....
no .
no .
look .
what i'm trying to tell you is ....
hey , it's okay .
you can tell me .
okay .
what i'm trying to tell you is ....
i'll be right back .
miss me?
nice place you got here .
lots of space .
vicki , we've really got to talk .
i'm very upset .
we were having dinner .
i was a man doing well with a beautiful woman .
and without so much as an apology ... ... you ran off with that sideshow phony .
you know ... ... i've recently had a tragedy in my life .
alicia ... ... threw herself out a window .
oh , my god .
but ... ... you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs .
well , miss vale ... ... another rooster in the hen house?
take thy beak from out my heart .
bruce ....
bruce ... wayne , n'est ce pas?
most of the time .
i know who you are .
let me tell you about this guy i know , jack .
mean kid .
bad seed .
hurt people .
i like him already .
you know what the problem was?
he got sloppy .
you know , crazy .
he started to lose it .
he had a head full of bad wiring , i guess .
couldn't keep it straight up here .
he was the kind of guy who ... ... couldn't hear the train until it was two feet from him .
you know what happened to this guy , jack?
well ....
he made mistakes .
then he ended up with his lights out !
now you want to get nuts?
come on !
let's get nuts !
tell me something .
have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
what?
i always ask that of all my prey .
i just like the sound of it .
never rub another man's rhubarb .
why is it , every time i come for you ... ... somebody always gets in the way?
i'll need a moment alone .
i'm only laughing on the outside .
my smile is just skin deep .
if you could see inside ... ... i'm really crying .
you might join me for a weep .
you really wouldn't believe it .
while you were entertaining , i've been finding out about your street corner .
i think your friend is screwed up .
more good news .
oh , my god !
his parents were murdered in that alley .
that's why he went there .
he watched it happen in front of him .
look at the look on his face .
it was the same at city hall .
what do you suppose this does to a kid?
vale ....
don't get personal !
alfred ....
did you get the file on my parents?
it's on your table .
thank you .
what's on your mind , alfred?
i have no wish to fill my few remaining years ... ... grieving for the loss of old friends ...
... or their sons .
the 200th anniversary birthday gala ... ... has been indefinitely postponed .
we cannot guarantee public safety .
joker here .
we got interference .
now you fellows have said some pretty mean things .
some of which were true under that fiend ... ... boss grissom .
he was a thief ... and a terrorist .
on the other hand , he had a tremendous singing voice .
he's dead now , and he's left me in charge .
i can be theatrical ... ... and maybe even a little rough .
but one thing i am not ... ... is a killer !
joker : i love a good party .
so , truce .
commence au festival !
and i've got a surprise for gotham city .
at midnight , i will dump 20 million in cash ... ... on the crowd .
don't worry about me . i've got enough .
we are not prepared to discuss any deals .
you heard it , folks , 20 million .
and there will be entertainment .
the big dukeroo .
with me in one corner , and in the other corner ... ... the man who has brought real terror to gotham city ... ... batman .
can you hear me?
just the two of us .
mano y mano . i have taken off my make up .
let's see ... ... if you can take off yours .
tell me , kid .
have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?
let's go !
let's go , jack !
see you around .
am i crazy?
that wasn't just another night for either of us , was it?
we both got to each other , didn't we?
why won't you let me in?
why?
you got in .
i've loved you since i met you .
but i don't know what to think of all this .
sometimes i don't know , either .
it's just something i have to do .
why?
because nobody else can .
look ....
i tried to avoid all this , but i can't .
this is how it is .
it's not a perfect world .
it doesn't have to be a perfect world .
i just have to know , are we going to try to love each other?
i'd like to .
but he's out there right now .
and i've got to go to work .
joker : into the air , junior birdman !
miss me?
yeah !
watch me !
get them .
take the pictures .
gotham's greed .
and now , folks ... ... it's time for , " who do you trust?
hubba , hubba , hubba !
money , money !
who do you trust?
me? i'm giving away free money .
and where ... is the batman?
he's at home , washing his tights .
winged battle flies through the night and finds me ready .
bob .
mask .
masks !
put them on now !
and now ... ... comes the part ... ... where i relieve you , the little people ... ... of the burden ... of your failed ... ... and useless lives .
but , as my plastic surgeon always said , " if you've got to go ...
... go with a smile .
my god .
smylex gas .
he's going to kill everybody !
get in the car .
get in the car !

aaa ....

they're my balloons !
he stole my balloons !
why didn't somebody tell me he had one of those ... things?
bob .

i'll need a minute or two alone , boys .
get out of here !
come on , you gruesome son of a bitch .
come to me .
darling .
i've got to get you to the church on time .

gotham city cathedral .

right away , sir?
five minutes .
better make it ten .
let's go .
point those searchlights at the tower .
now !

shall we dance?
you know , without you ... ... l just wouldn't want to go on .
we were made for each other .
beauty and the beast .
of course , if anyone calls you " beast " ... ... i'll rip their lungs out .
mr. joker?
you say such beautiful things .
and you're so powerful .
and purple !
i love purple !
excuse me .
have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
i'm going to kill you .
you idiot !
you made me , remember?
you dropped me into the chemicals !
that wasn't easy to get over !
and don't think i didn't try .
i know you did .
you killed my parents .
what?
what are you saying?
i made you , but you made me first .
i was just a kid .
i say you made me , you say i made you .
how childish can you get?
you wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on?
what are you laughing at?
let me lend you a hand .
lend you a hand !
they don't make them like they used to !
hey , batsy !
there he is !
down there !
it's time to retire .
feel free to drop in .
sometimes i just kill myself !
hold on !
our police have rounded up all of the joker's men .
the reign of crime is over .
public safety in gotham city is no longer a laughing matter .
aren't you covering the press conference?
no .
what about our pulitzer prize?
what about us?
what about your picture of batman?
take care .
we received a letter from batman .
please inform the citizens of gotham ...
... that gotham city's earned a rest from crime .
but if the forces of evil should rise again ...
... to cast a shadow on the heart of the city ...
... call me .
question .
how do we call him?
he gave us a signal .
i thought champagne would be in order , ma'am .
hi , alfred .
mr. wayne told me to tell you ... ... that he might be a little late .
i'm not a bit surprised .
