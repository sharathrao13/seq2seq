you are the enforcer ofyour laws?
no , but ifwe're going to survive here , then we have to learn how to get along with each other .

foryour people , itwas just that a theory .
for mine , itwas a practice .

the great debate in mytime ... was the possibilitythat life existed on other planets .

how many?
an infinite number .
but to end up on this planet with your particular life forms ... in this strange dimension beyond life itself that i had not planned on .

yesterday , by a man who claims to be the roman emperor nero .

though i guess the true nero has to be somewhere on this planet .
everyone comes here eventually , so it'spossible ,
he saved our lives , sam .

oh , you're not on earth anymore .
come on .
welcome to the go forbroke ,
for my sins , i am the captain .
it must have taken years to build a vessel ofthis six anda half , to be exact , ifyouplease ,
i modeled her on the steamers i used to pilot up and down the mississippi .
add a couple ofsails forthe scaredy ancients among us to make them feel comfortable .
those ofus from the civilized democracies , we are in the minority here in this world .
the average riverworlder wouldkillyouas soon as look atyou ,
but on this vessel, you're gonna find some rules and freedoms that don't exist on the land ,
and with those liberties , we are gonna travel everywhere and anywhere this riverwill take us .
areyou going downriver?
you got a reason we should go upriver?
yeah .
nobody ever learned anything sailing awayfrom the source .
howaboutseeingthe engine room?
everything you need to see you can see from up here .
we usedthe best materials andmen ,
and we got fellas here who worked on st , paul's cathedral , the pyramids , the titanic , which they tell me was quite an engineering feat , despite its later mishap .
i'm sure any question you have will be answered soon enough .
in the meantime , there's plenty ofjobs around here foryou to earn your keep .
these areyourshadows ,
doesn't look like we have much ofa choice .
it's nothing personal .
just can't afford a security risk this close to launching her .
sam , a word , excuse me .
well , what is it?
i found enough palladium to start thewheels and keep them turning .
where?
a decoration on valdemar's throne .
it's pretty rare , monat .
any cetian can smell saturated metal hydride a mile away .
ourtechnology is based on it .
timing's good , with valdemargone , it'llbeprettyconfusedaround there , i'm sure i can get it ,
valdemarwe knew .
nero we don't .
what if one of us gets caught?
no .
can't risk it .
sam , the whole rock gives us enough critical mass to finally launch this boat .
i saywaiting is the risk .
this is not a democracy , tane .
i decidewho goes , who stays , when we launch and when we don't .
and what i'm tellingyou both is
i'll think about it .
howyou everconvincedme to develop this cockamamie technology ofyours , i'll neverknow ,
what's the matterwith a wood burning furnace anyway?
myboat powered byrocks ,
pull it close .
gwen , look .
i could makeyou a pretty dress .
me?
look , i've almost forgotten what it's like to wear civilized clothes .
how about i teach you to sew as well?
i'm just gonna take a bath .
what , you wanna comewatch me?
whoo !
what doyou mind?
no , i don't .
in mytime , when a bunch ofus wouldget togetherin a hot tub , we'dcallit aparty ,
but i guess you didn't do that kind ofstuffin your time .
not if one had manners .
i wonderwhat my children would thinkofme now?
did you have a family?
i had a son .
he died ofleukemia .
and his ... mother , well , she tried
she tried , butshe couldn't standthepain , she took herown life ,
i'm so sorry .
so who's gonna get out first?
not me .
howmuch ofit is mine?
as far as the eye can see .
to expandfurther , we need the ship the rebels are building ,
ourspies tell us it's nearlyreadyto launch ,
then we should act soon .
we mine enough ore from the rocks that fall from the sky to keep our men fullyarmed ,
the rebels steal from the harvest fields occasionally , but it never amounts to much ,
valdemar couldn't catch them?
they are highly skilled .
sometimes it is better to allow them some freedom .
their ingenuity can be useful .

besides , we're goin 'downriver .
that doesn't seem to interestyou .
sam , listen to me .
in all youryears here , haveyou ever seen a native ofthis world?
not in 1 0 years .
there's stories , but that's all they are .
they're not stories .
someone came to me while i was still under the water ... and he gave me the power to see the future .
i saw nero .
i saw a dark tower wrapped in ice and snow ... and i saw this exact boat headed upriver and i was on it .
well , i reckon ifthat's ourfuture , then it'll happen just theway you saw it .
you don't believe me .
i don't believe anyone , and i don't believe in anyone except myself .
then believe in what your eyes are telling you .
believe in that .

there's some things there that we need .
he's been mining the meteors , iron forweapons mostly .
but meteors contain otheruseful metals , hale ,
the rarest is hydratedpalladium , which we intend to use as a fuel for ourboiler ,

lev , i'm going after alice .
good luck .
i was inexperienced .
impatient .
i lacked thejudgment ofthe elder emperors .
but i've learned from my mistakes .
and now i know i need a strong empress by my side ... to steady me , to teach me ... compassion , an emotion i was never allowed to develop in rome .
choose someone else .
look , you have secrets .
i don't know whatyou're talking about .
you have such pain behind your eyes .

we need power now , orwe're gonna hit the rocks .
what about the sails?
it's keeping us from drifting , but that's about it .
we're doing all we can .
we got a kink in here somewhere .
not a technologically sound idea .
necessity is the mother ofinvention .
hit it ! it's working !
wait !
enough already .
she's coming around .
i've got her , we're in the clear ,
good going .
sam , there might be morevandals on the boat .

i'll sweep aft .
stay put !
watch yourself .
we're almost clear , hale , be careful ,
your fight's with me .
i suppose it is .
but i askedmyself , " whybother?
what an artist the world loses in me .
famous last words , right?
you've studied me .
how gratifying .
yeah , i've studied you .
i've studied nero the emperor , nero the coward .
according to history , you poisoned yourwayto the top , and then , underyourfine leadership , thewhole empire fell .
well , history is mistaken .
you were thesadend to theaugustan dynasty andthe endofrome ,
no !
no !
i tried to resurrect a crumbling republic .
myown mother , mywife octavia they all plotted against me ... and against rome .
i died fighting against false accusations .
you died on the run , and then you killed yourself becauseyou were afraid to faceyour enemies .
that wasyourlegacy ,
bevery , very careful .
give him yourweapon .
i said ...
come on ! give him yourweapon .
move !
i'll die fighting false accusations again , ifthat's what the gods demand ofme .
so neptunewill have my sacrifice .
the first person you have ever killed .
yeah .
yeah , up close .
hewon't be the last .
not byfar .
nero's dead .
dropyourweapons .
drop it !

it looks likewe're going with you whetheryou like it or not .
i guess so .
yes !
goodwork !
you were right .
itwas one hell ofa launch party .
come on in .
well , here's to life on the river .
well , they all wantyou to be  sam , i did what i had to do to get us out ofthere .
this isn't my boat .
i didn't build her .
i'm not asking you to buy her , hale .
truth is , all i reallywant is to be the pilot ofthe go forbroke ,
mess about on the river .
i don't know , maybe maybe find myself a little adventure .
mess about on the river , huh?
kind oflike tom sawyer?
uh huh .
i don't know ifaunt polly would approve ofthat .
but ibet mark twain would ,
orsam clemens , as he was known to his friends back in the days when he was ,,, piloting that steamboat up and down ole'miss ,
mark twain .
i haven't heard that name in years .
born under a comet , died under a comet , partial to meteors ,
come on , sam .
why don'tyou tell them the truth?
whydon'tyou tell them whoyou reallyare?
doyou miss your family , hale?
i do .
but they know someone named marktwain .
when i look back on my earthly life , i realized that i was the most happiest ... when i was plain old sam the boat pilot .
maybe iknewwho i was andwho i wasn't ,
now i figure that's why i'm here , to find out ... why that was so .
i'd sure appreciate it ifyou let it stay that way ...
captain ,
let's head upriver .
theirjourney has begun .
as you said itwould .
butwill it be completed in time?
will it be completed at all?
that , none ofus can foresee .
