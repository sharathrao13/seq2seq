i just love mushrooms ,
one of my favorites , or as i call it ,,, ,,, the king of mushrooms , is the porcini ,
now , stop right there ,
don't be alarmed ,
there's a lot of confusion in this country between porcini ,,, ,,, the italian name , and cpes , which is the french name , ,,, the italian name , and cpes , which is the french name ,
they're fat and they're earthy ,
now , the porcini is most often seen dried here in this country ,
and they would always be labeled ,,, ,,, dried porcinis , not dried cpes .

that's a photo of travis alfred walker .
stanford dropout , treasure hunter .
only to date ... ... the only thing he's found is trouble .
did you say , " walker "?
my son .
from my third marriage .
lasted about three minutes .
that picture was taken two months ago ... ... in some gold mining town called el dorado in the middle of the amazon .
how much?
250 large .
for that much , why not invite him back yourself?
the boy doesn't trust me .
kidnapping's gonna help .
is that sarcasm?
you wanna be sarcastic , do it to your monkey friends !
you do not do it to me !
do you understand?
i'm sorry , billy .
you're goddamn right you are .
what'd he do?
pissed off the wrong people .
i don't have to remind you what happens when you do that , do i?
so i bought him some forgiveness .
but if i don't bring him back to face the music ... ... you know damn well that i can't carry a tune .
so you deliver my boy back here , you bring him right through that door ... ... you walk out of this house a free man , with a restaurant .
is that duct tape?
don't worry there , little fella .
walk by faith , not by sight .
will you look at that?
we can't land now .
why?
why can't we land?
they got the bulls on the ground .
booze on the grind "?
the bulls .
on the ground .
cattle down there .
cows?
yeah .
i'll give them a wee fright there .
get moving !
come on !
out of me way !
out the way , you !
move it !
move it now !
out my way !
out me way !
all right there , little fella .
okay , gotcha .
what did i tell you about the lamp?
my needle was totally knackered .
rpm's all over the shop .
is this the only road in and out?
lf you wanna stay alive .
why is that?
there .
that's the jungle , little fella .
you got anacondas in there .
poison arrow frogs , black flies , bullet ants .
if they don't get you , the rebels will .
what?
rebels .
that's what i'm telling you .
to them , cornelius hatcher's built a babylon in paradise .
built a what?
a babylon .
yeah , that mine is as close as a man can come to the gates of hell ... ... while his heart's still beating .
the sunday school picnic is over , i'll tell you that .
stay out of the jungle , little fella , okay?
i found these flowers growing in the deepest parts of the jungle .
i mean , as far as i can tell , no one's ever identified them ... ... which means i'm responsible for naming them .
i can only think of one word that fits something so beautiful .
mariana .
how much do you want?
what?
how much?
i need your uncle's boat .
a day or two , max .
mariana ...
you borrow my car , bring it back with no windshield .
my brother's scooter ...
that wasn't my fault .
now you want to borrow my uncle's boat?
i found it , i found it . " you'll never find this garbo of yours .
it's " gato , " i told you .
gato .
it's out there , mariana .
i know exactly where it is .
but i need that boat .
how much?
i told you , i ...
no .
how much is your gato worth?
this is a very significant academic find .
how much?
it's not about money .
you lie like a little girl , travis .
i'm not lying .
if i get the boat for you , you have to take me with you .
ridiculous .
we're talking about a boat .
and we split the take 50 50 .
i've been doing all the work , okay?
i found it .
no way .
50 50 , travis .
70 30 .
50 50 .
60 40 .
50 50 , and i get off work at 6 .
then we can go and get your gato .
you're evil .
thank you .
whatever .
for the flowers .
harvey !
we're here to see your brother .
where's he from?
he's an american , you got a gun?
no , i don't like guns .
check him .
what's the current payout?
give me a payout for quadrant 3 .
2425 , down 20 percent .
checked him?
all right , let's go .
come on .
come on .
i never met an american who didn't like guns .
tell them to dig harder .
if only it were that simple , eh , mr. beck?
how do you know my name?
when a man of your dimensions ... ... travels all this way to visit a place like this ... ... it arouses the curiosity .
what can i do for you?
do you know this man?
travis walker .
i let him excavate around the mine ... ... allow him to rent a room in my town ... ... all for a fair 60 percent of anything he might unearth .
where can i find him?
follow the bullshit .
guy's mouth should be in the circus .
brother , please .
do you have business with him?
i do .
what kind of business?
i love business .
it's personal .
so ... ... why come to me?
when i'm a guest in a man's house ... ... i don't reach into his refrigerator without permission .
refrigerator .
i want to show you something , mr. beck , please .
does that look like a refrigerator to you?
looks more like hell .
where you see hell , i see a spellbinding sense of purpose .
i see the value of keeping your eye on the ball .
when a bride slips the ring on her finger ,,, ,,, when a businessman lays his hands on a rolex ,,, ,,, when a rapper gets a shiny new tooth , this is that cost , mr , beck ,
my horror for their beauty .
my hell for their little slice of heaven .
somebody's gotta keep his eye on the ball ,
that somebody is me , mr , beck ,
i am down here every day keeping my eye on the ball ,
that's just a simple fact of life ,
and if you're bold enough to face that cold , hard fact ,,, ... you can make a lot of money .
what do you want with the kid?
i've come to take him home .
that'll cost you $ 10, 000 .
i need to borrow the jeep .
wait a minute , friend .
i'll give you $ 1000 .
i'll give you $ 1000 .
i need you to take my bag back to the plane , keep the engine running .
can you do that?
for $ 1000?
that's right .
i'll find a way .
declan .
i'm gonna be coming fast .
american?
yeah .
where from?
someplace that's got bartenders .
what can i get you?
i'll take a beer .
nice flowers .
the smiling fool .
back in the states , brazil nuts like these go for $ 15 a pound .
well , those fell off the tree out back .
and around here , we don't call them brazil nuts .
what do you call them?
well , we're in brazil ... ... so we just call them nuts .
fair enough .
what brings you to the amazon ... ... other than the food and drink , of course?
i'm looking for a man .
what's your type?
his name's travis walker .
brown hair .
he's in his 20s .
wears a blue shirt , jeans .
right now he's got a real bewildered look on his face .
do i know you?
name's beck .
what can i do for you?
i need you to make a choice for me .
a choice?
option a or option b.
what's option a?
option a is , you and i walk out of here nice and easy ... ... and drive back to the airstrip .
and then we begin our long journey back to los angeles .
there'll be no blood , no broken bones ... ... and no problems .
what's in los angeles?
your father .
what's option b?
pretty much the opposite of a.
but i wouldn't recommend that one .
i'll take option c.
travis , there is no option c.
really?
are you sure?
i mean , big boy , there's always an option c.
so angry !
shut up .
shut up !
like i said , there is no option c.
let me introduce you to option c.
mr. beck ...
... there's been a slight change in the narrative .
an unexpected twist , you might say .
can i have a beer , please?
mr. hatcher , i was just gonna come find you when this ...
the kid stays .
i paid you .
well , fortunately ... ... i had my fingers crossed the whole time .
apparently , young mr. walker ... ... may have stumbled onto a trinket of value .
and as he's located it in my jungle ... ... i'm gonna need him to lead me to it .
okay , so let's go , dickhead .
don't call me a dickhead , you dickhead .
did you find it or not , asshole?
what , asshole?
did you find it or not?
what's that?
did you find it or not , asshole?
don't !
hey , don't rock the boat .
okay .
i don't want any trouble .
leave now .
don't come back .
and the 10, 000?
consider it tax deductible .
a contribution to your personal health fund .
with all due respect , mr. hatcher ... ... i'm feeling pretty healthy .
oh , yeah?
walk .
don't make waves .
you're gonna kill us all , mr. beck?
i tried to be reasonable .
that's not the way to do business .
you should've kept the gun .
you're dead already .
you just don't know it yet .
this is option b?
are you kidding me?
this is option b?
are you kidding me?
quiet .
you're dead .
you're so dead .
we won't get out of here .
all this land , hatcher owns it .
the road , the air , hatcher owns it all .
shut up .
whatever my dad is paying you ... ... i will double it .
no .
i'll quadruple it .
no .
double it and quadruple it .
no .
you're being unreasonable !
i'll give you a chance to reconsider .
you get one more chance to shut up .
is that your final answer?
for what it's worth , i hope you enjoy the fall .
yeah , what fall?
this fall .
come on , big boy , where's the frigging keys?
all right .
travis?
good god !
travis !
i'm not going back .
oh , you're going back .
no way .
right now .
who the hell do you think you are?
you come into my town , mess up my bar ... ... and you eyeball my woman?
eyeball your woman?
it's on .
what's this?
who is this?
is he your friend?
do you know him?
do you?
say hello .
say hello .
say hello .
are you finished?
let's go .
big boy , you like thunderstorms?
bet you do , right?
little thunder?
stop it .
little lightning?
stop !
thunder?
lightning?
thunder?
lightning?
ears ...
you done beating me up?
let's go .
i'm tired of this .
you win .
come on !
go to sleep .
go to sleep .
night night .
night night .
go to sleep now !
come on !
obviously , we got off on the wrong foot here .
so i'm gonna be completely candid with you .
have you ever heard of the gato do diabo?
the devil's cat?
you're gonna stop speaking now .
all right .
it's ...
it's a priceless object , man .
forged out of pure gold .
worth millions .
you said priceless .
you do not want to argue semantics with a ph. d. candidate .
ph. d.?
yeah .
i am really very close to being dr. travis walker .
you dropped out of stanford after two semesters , einstein .
so i'm fairly close .
closer than you .
close to getting your ass kicked again .
wait , wait , wait !
the gato is real , all right?
i know where to find it .
i'll split it with you , 80 20 .
move !
70 30?
you're a very unpleasant individual , you know that?
you think they're dead?
what am i , psychic?
i'm gonna cut that kid's nose off .
no , harvey .
you want the gato because if the bad guys get it ... ... they won't need us anymore .
there'll be no one to work the mine .
you want to work the mine?
there are two men in that jungle who are trying to steal from me .
i feel like a little boy who's lost his first tooth ... ... put it under his pillow , waiting for the tooth fairy to come .
only , two evil burglars have crept in my window ... ... and snatched it before she could get here .
wait a second .
do you understand the concept of the tooth fairy?
explain it to them .
you find a tooth , you put it under your pillow .
the fairy comes ... ... waiting for the tooth .
wait .
she takes the goddamn thing , gives you a quarter !
they got my tooth !
i want it back .
i have to ask you , back at the bar , man .
that was crazy !
no guns .
strip , toss , toss , strip .
didn't i tell you to be quiet?
i know , but what is that?
some kind of nouveau samurai code?
you got a problem with guns?
they take me to a place i don't wanna go .
where do they take you?
to a place you don't wanna see me go .
walk !
how often do you work out?
let me get this straight ,
you never use guns?
no .
never?
never .
what if your best friend was gonna die?
no guns .
santa would do it to save his best friend .
do i look like santa claus?
do i look like santa claus to you?
what is it?
guns make you um pouco louco?
bang bang crazy?
i pick up guns , bad things happen .
i don't like that .
what kind of things?
very bad things , travis .
walk .
what about knives?
move !
my father doesn't share the same distaste .
he's your father .
he won't kill you .
all he cares about ... ... is what's good for business .
now , the question is , mr. beck ... ... what's good for your business?
you don't like money?
i don't make deals with people like you .
you don't even know me .
you're like every jackass i take down .
first they try to run , then fight , then they try to negotiate .
when that fails , they do what you're about to do when you realize it's over .
oh , yeah?
what's that?
you're gonna get down on your hands and knees and beg me for a break .
well , guess what .
i don't give breaks .
no breaks .
you don't understand the situation .
you borrowed money from the wrong guy .
you slept with the wrong guy's wife .
i don't care .
your mistake .
what about you , mr. beck?
haven't you ever made a mistake?
i know !
move .
no breaks .
that's lame .
no breaks !
no , i don't give breaks .
santa claus doesn't give any breaks .
should've been at the airstrip by now .
like i'm gonna help .
i didn't ask for your help .
what are you doing?
i have to pee .
pee in your pants .
move .
no .
i've let you push me around this jungle for , like , five hours .
you've been very aggressive , and i'm not moving until you let me pee .
if you wanna keep going , you'll have to carry me .
i'll pee on your head .
you threatening me?
you threatening me with pee?
well , yeah , if you don't let me pee here .
fine .
you win .
pee .
will you unzip me?
no , i won't .
you wanna pee , you got 30 seconds .
how can with i my hands cuffed?
find a way .
pee .
come on .
don't make it weird .
please?
don't breathe , don't say a word .
don't even look at me .
look over there .
thanks , man .
oh , shit .
i can't get it out !
could you just help ...?
no .
hell , no .

shrimp and pea risotto with basil and mint .

looks like you're wolfgang stuck right here .
travis !
travis !
hey !

thank you so much .

why you always gotta hit me?
now listen to me .

let's go back to back .

he's humping me !
make him stop !

who's that?
it's the rebels .
don't worry , they're my friends .
god bless you !
say hi .
hi .
these are your friends , huh?
what , are you kidding me?
i'm starting to long for a monkey with a hard on .
whatever happens , just keep looking into his eyes .
won't that offend him?
no .
whatever you do , do not blink .
they're like grizzlies .
just shut up and let me take care of this .
we know you work for hatcher .
were you tracking us? !
he thinks we work for hatcher .
well , tell him the truth .
fierce gaze .
fierce gaze .
fierce gaze .
honorable host , unlike this man on my left , i do not work for that evil scum .
why does the giant stare at me without respect?
i will cut out his arrogant eyes !
what's he saying?
shut up .
just hold his gaze .
he is hatcher's assassin .
paid to hunt all who oppose him , including me .
why do i get the feeling you really suck at portuguese?
what did he say? !
he says he pisses on your ancestors ... ... and that you would make a very pretty bride !
what's going on?
he wants to fight you .
no .
we're not fighting .
tell him i don't want to fight .
the assassin is a great warrior !
better to shoot him now and get it over with !
we are not fighting .
don't worry , they're little people .
what?
you could take them .
they're little .
you can win .
why do you want to fight?
why?
i just want to get back to the airport .
please .
i just have to get home .
okay , hip hop .
i don't want to do this .
please .
please .
travis , tell them one more time i do not want to fight .
i'd love to help you out , buddy , but i don't think ... ... they're really listening to me anymore .
heads up .
that's okay !
that is okay !
hey , kansas cities !
don't do it .
what is that?
it's like spinning tarzan jujitsu !
speedy little bastards , aren't they?
head's gotta stay up .
i am not your enemy .
mariana?
what are you doing here?
barmaid by day , rebel leader by night .
you are good !
the whole time i was working you , you were working me .
i was hoping you might find o gato do diabo .
it couldn't have all been work .
could it?
man , that was some good work .
what do you think , travis?
i knew .
you know that , right?
i totally knew .
of course .
hey .
the herbs will keep it from getting infected .
why do you do this?
pardon me?
why do you fight?
because of 65 cents an hour .
that's what hatcher pays the workers .
but in order to mine , you need tools .
you need food , clothing , a place to sleep .
you have no money , so , what do you do?
you borrow from hatcher .
pick and shovel , a dollar a day .
a sack to haul the dirt , another dollar .
old mr. beck knows a lot about debt , don't you?
he knows what it's like to dig a hole so deep you can't climb out .
call it what you want .
it's escravido ,
slavery .
and we intend to stop it .
manito wants to know who would win a fight between tyson and ali .
ali , hands down .
he says , " what about tyson's power?
shit .
tell him ali would've done to tyson ... ... what he did to foreman in africa .
rumble .
rumble in the jungle ,
tell him ali was too smart .
too smart , too fast .
would've used his jabs .
bam , bam !
would've danced .
would've played with his mind .
before you know it , bam !
left to the body .
bam !
right to the head .
down goes tyson .
float like butterfly .
sting like bee .
float like butterfly , sting like bee .
yeah !
float like butterfly , sting like a bee !
yeah !
float like butterfly , sting like a bee !
he says he thinks you are a great fighter ... ... and he wants you to have it .
it's for luck .
tell him i'm sorry , i can't .
you'll offend him if you refuse .
i'm honored .
thank you .
you'll need all the luck you can get .
it's a long walk back to the airfield .
especially by yourself .
nice !
you don't understand .
i'm not going back without him .
oh , here we go again .
fifty rifles say you are .
and we're rebels , not thieves .
hatcher !
travis !
let's clean it up .
not so fast , jungle boy .
move !
move !
come on !
manito !
go , go , go !
manito !
let's go !
i want hunting parties .
small ones .
find them .
find them !
all right , this is the way it's going to be .
you're going to take me to o gato do diabo .
and you're going to take me now .
calm down .
don't !
you saw what they do .
don't ever tell me to calm down .
travis , don't play with me .
or what?
or i'm going to shoot you .
well , if you shoot me , you're never gonna find the gato .
so we're gonna make a little deal .
deal?
you see?
o gato is an object to you .
it's life on the riviera , a private yacht .
you don't know anything about me .
for us it's hope .
my heart's breaking .
it's like a telethon .
you selfish ...
enough !
sit down !
sit down !
holy shit , you tried to shoot me !
you saw it !
crazy .
shut up .
shut up .
the deal's this .
he takes you to the gato .
you just show me how i get out of this jungle so i can take him home .
deal?
do we have a deal?
deal .
let me get this straight .
she gets what she needs , you get what you need ... ... and i get the shaft .
i could always give her back the gun .
i really don't like you .
yeah , well , i get that a lot .
seriously .
what?
i was just wondering how it is you came to do ... ... you know , whatever it is you do .
it's a long story .
it's a long walk .
i grew up in a very rough place .
one thing led to another , that's all .
just like you .
like me?
yeah , you get pushed , you push back .
well , with me , i pushed so hard that word got around .
before i knew it , i was in a room full of the wrong people ... ... with the wrong money .
so you think i'm standing in a room full of the wrong people?
yeah .
something like that .
i like you , mr. beck .
really .
but you and i are nothing alike .
travis !
let's keep moving .
let's go .
what are you doing?
let's take us a little swim , wolfgang .
we're not swimming .
let's go .
come on , big boy .
you could use a bath .
travis , we have to keep moving .
it'll be dark soon .
why?
we're already here .
don't pee in the water .
why?
a candiru , a vicious parasite , will swim up the urine into your pau .
come on , big boy !
it feels good !
swim up my what?
your pinto .
it'll swim up your ding dong .
and once it gets in , you can't get it out .
come on !
wait .
well , then what?
they have to amputate .
not this boy's pinto , not today .
the hieroglyphic code ... ... said the great chief of the maraj people put the gato to sleep ... ... behind walls of a moving curtain .
a waterfall .
must be some kind of methane buildup .
it's cool .
let's go .
oh , god !
yeah , real genius .
you have no clue what you're doing .
oh , shut up !
you obviously don't know anything about methane deposits .
oh , and you do?
shut up .
what'd you just say?
what is it?
why do i get the feeling we are not supposed to be here?
because we're not .
there it is !
i told you it was real !
travis , you're never gonna get back there .
it's too dangerous .
the roof is coming down !
wait a second .
a jaguar .
i know what this is .
monkey .
eagle .
i can't hold this , travis .
i know what this is .
what is it?
it's an 800 year old safe .
this is how they kept their treasures protected .
there's a combination .
jaguar , cat .
gato , cat .
it's gotta be the jaguar .
we pull the sticks closest to the jaguar , we'll be okay .
for 60 seconds , then the roof's coming down .
you're not gonna touch anything .
let's go !
all right .
follow the jag .
follow the jaguar .
easy .
easy .
it's coming down , travis .
what are you doing?
let's go !
pass it to me .
is that a jaguar?
i think it's an eagle !
travis , hurry !
oh , my ...
here , kitty , kitty , kitty .
i did it .
i found you .
not some oxford archaeologist or some stiff ass harvard professor .
i did it !
i found you !
who gives a shit?
how you like me now , huh , beck?
go !
go !
move !
now !
run !
let's go !
move !
these are konlabos .
they're very rare .
you're lucky .
and i wouldn't flirt with o gato do diabo's eyes if i were you .
they say it's dangerous .
what else do they say?
once restored to its rightful owners , the rivers will be laden with fish .
and the trees will grow tall , bringing shade for hammocks ... ... so its people may rest their backs .
you think bringing this gato will do all that?
no , mr. beck .
but i expect the money selling it brings will do just that .
we can buy seed , irrigate .
farm our own lands .
free ourselves from hatcher's mine .
when that statue hits the black market , it'll vanish forever .
it's a little late for morals .
especially after you were going to do the same thing .
and 10 percent of that is going to pay for your freedom ... ... so i'd be a little more grateful if i were you .
what if i told you i was gonna give it to a museum ... ... so the whole world could appreciate it?
you can tell me anything you want , travis , but i know you .
what are you going to do after you bring him home?
i'm gonna open a restaurant .
yeah .
he's a killer in the kitchen too .
ten , 15 tables .
nothing fancy .
italian .
southern italian .
how do you ...?
how do you ...?
how do you spell ... ,,, konlabos?
konlabos , with a k.
don't worry .
after four or five hours , you'll be as good as new .
the fire will keep the animals away until sunup .
i'm sorry ... ... but money has a way of changing people .
you did find it , travis .
just like you said .
no one can take that away from you .
and i will send you the money ... ... buy your freedom .
i meant that .
you kept your word , and i admire that ... ... so i'll keep mine .
go north until you reach the quantana road .
take it south all the way to the airfield .
good luck to you , mr. beck .
oh , shit .
what?
what?
what?
monkey .
monkey .
monkey?
where?
just get him away from me .
get out of here .
get out of here .
get out of here , monkey !
oh , no .
i hate this place .
get out of here !
i hate penis eating minnows , and i hate freaky fruit .
get them away from me .
i wanna go home .
i want concrete .
get out of here , monkey .
i want homemade tortellini .
i want my los angeles lakers .
that's what i want .
i want to go home .
i want to go home .
i want to go home !
get out of here , monkey .
get out of here , monkey .
well , what about that?
been for a stroll , have you , boys?
where's my bag?
where's my jeep?
give me my bag .
you have any water?
sit down .
how soon before we can take off?
you left a jeep at the bottom of a mountainside .
i'll take care of it .
in a bloody large puddle .
i said , i'll take care of it .
that jeep is dead , my friend .
look , you'll get your money .
just start the plane .
what's your big hurry?
i'm trying to leave before i run into hatcher or more problems .
don't go worrying about hatcher .
that monstrosity won't give a flying fornication ... ... for the pair of youse no more .
he got what he was after .
what do you mean?
he caught up with poor mariana in the jungle .
he relieved her of her artifact .
what'd you say?
i said , he relieved her of her artifact .
it's a word in the english language .
artifact . " look it up .
son of a bitch .
he's got my gato !
your what?
the gato .
don't you speak english?
hey .
where is she?
hatcher's got her in town .
he's torturing her for information .
he's doing what?
freedom fighters?
freedom fighters , my ass .
lutadores de louco , you ask me .
they're all gonna die .
come on .
all aboard .
come on .
what are you doing?
we made a deal .
a deal?
what the hell does that mean?
i'm here at the airstrip , she doesn't have the gato .
gonna go in there by yourself?
no way .
no way .
hey , hatcher's got a small army back there .
you don't know your way around the town .
oh , wait .
i got an idea .
saddle up to one of those bulls ... ... ride into town like a conquistador and challenge all of them to a duel .
oh , yeah .
i forgot .
you don't use guns .
what's your point?
you're gonna die , beck .
the boy's right .
you mind if we settle the bill now?
you need help .
are you gonna help me , travis?
all you care about is the money .
no , beck , you're wrong .
i'd rather die than let that son of a bitch get my gato .
you need all the help you can get .
you can even use him , for chrissake .
don't bring me into it .
i got a dodgy knee here .
you can't do this on your own .
okay , travis .
i know you're gonna run on me .
might not be tonight or tomorrow .
but i will find you , and i will take you back .
are we clear?
yeah .
we'll both probably be dead in about an hour .
so let's cancel christmas .
your plan of attack was a bit naive .
man , if i was only 10 minutes younger , huh?
i suppose now we have a conversation where you enlighten me .
mr. hatcher .
how many more of you are out there?
enlighten me .
where are the rest of your compadres?
enlighten me !
mr. hatcher .
i don't get why you people are so hostile .
i've been good to you .
i built you a town .
why are we fighting?
mr. hatcher .
what?
we've lost contact with outpost 1 .
there's nobody answering .
mr , hatcher , are you out there?
what can i do for you , mr. beck?
i have no desire to fight with you or your men ,
for that reason , you have two options ,
option a , you leave the gato and the girl ,,, ,,, and you walk out of town , no questions asked ,
what's option b?
option b ,,, ,,, i make you ,
wrong choice ,
lock down the town .
still no visual contact , team two is checking the perimeter right now ,
he ... ... that heard the sound of thy holy trumpet ... ... and took not warning ... ... he hath clearly wandered too far ... ... from the word of god .
and cornelius bernard hatcher ... ,,, your heir has come , let's get it on , big boy !
it's time to get back on the path .
that's a lot of cows .
hi .
what nerve .
about bloody time , huh?
somebody just shoot him .
oh , yeah?
oh , you want one?
oh , okay .
a little thunder?
huh?
you like thunderstorms , big boy?
how about some lightning?
ear , ear ...
ears , eyes , foot , face !
take the gato and the girl and get to the airfield .
if you run into trouble , use her as a hostage .
and harvey , when you're safely out of town ... ... put her out of my misery .
i need help !
do not go gentle into that good night , my lovely .
beck !
i need help .
beck !
rage , rage ... ... against the dying of the light .
there shall be no mercy ...
... for any force that stands ...
... blocking this path of his righteousness .
beck , help !
help !
move !
no way .
give me back my gato , you little bald freak !
oh , great .
see you .
you got the moves .
i'll give you that .
you reached into the wrong refrigerator , mr. beck .
hold your horses .
what have i done?
are we not men?
hatcher .
what?
option a is still on the table .
you can walk away right now .
option a doesn't work for me .
before i came here , what did you people have?
face it .
be fair .
i put a roof over your head , coin in your pockets .
you barefoot indians didn't have pockets ... ... before hatcher came along .
i gave you a life !
i'm the heart in the darkness .
face it ... ... you can't run this thing without me .
i am pumping the blood of the modern world ... ... into your backward veins ... ... you stinking ... ... ingrate ... ... oompa loompa ... ... morons !
okay .
that's it , i'm done .
mr. beck ... ... i'll take option a.
clear , please .
oh , shit .
you make a hell of an entrance , mr. beck .
yeah .
i'd offer you a beer , but i think you blew up my bar .
yeah , i think you're right .
thank you .
we had a deal .
yes , we did .
and i'm afraid i didn't deliver on that deal .
how is that?
the gato .
i promised you the gato .
yes , well , i promised you travis .
you all talking about this travis?
and this gato?
i'm impressed .
yeah , well , make sure they spell my name right .
i told you it wasn't about the money .
well , big boy ... ... i guess it's your move .
i'm impressed myself , travis .
declan , start the plane .
declan , start the plane "?
what does that mean?
i'm taking you home .
oh , i figured that .
no breaks .
good luck .
you too .
i will send you your cut .
move .
not a penny less than 15 . 6 million .
move , travis .
you really ought to stay away from guns .
you ought to get yourself a psychiatrist .
seriously .
move .
well , look at him .
look at you .
your beard .
you're like a real man .
but you're so thin .
running is good exercise .
good exercise .
that's funny .
did you hear him?
running for your life .
i love it .
i really do !
you know there's not enough aspirin in the world ... ... for a headache like you?
well , there probably is .
but i understand what you mean .
well , that's good .
because that means you'll understand why you'll take that trip to chicago .
actually , i don't completely understand that one .
still the smart ass .
i'm not that smart , dad .
i didn't know she was married .
well , she was .
very married .
and you .
what took you so long , huh?
your kid was a tough rundown , billy .
him?
no .
yeah , yeah .
but i did walk him right through that door , right?
like we agreed?
you did .
we good?
we're good .
two hundred and fifty large .
you got your restaurant , kid .
now get out of here , huh?
before i leave ...
when i was in brazil , they showed me this ritual they do ... ... when they have big celebrations .
what they do is , they eat this fruit , and it's called konlabos , with a k.
so i figured before i leave , we could celebrate one last time .
come on , guys .
try some of this .
if he says it's good , it's gotta be .
he's the best chef i know .
billy , here , you try the first piece .
not bad .
big seeds , though .
i don't like seeds .
hey , what are you ...?
i walked him right through that door , billy .
boy ... ... you got a funny iooking face .
hey , dad .
i love you , you know that?
i love you , you know that?
because you showed me something back there .
i thought you had character , but i wasn't sure .
you got it , man .
you really got it !
get in the truck .
you violated every agricultural law .
that's the least of my problems .
we should go back in there and finish him off .
you want to go back , go ahead .
knock yourself out .
i'll wait for you .
i'm not going back .
right .
so shut up , get in the truck before i change my mind .
don't push me .
what?
don't push me .
i appreciate everything you did .
if you want to get technical , all you did is even the score .
i saved you first .
get in .
you don't have to thank me .
but this pushing shit ain't happening no more .
you read me?
okay .
i'm gonna bust you up .
go for it .
yeah .
hey , remember your friend mr. thunder?
how about his buddy mr. lightning?
i know you know him .
you know him real well , don't you?
i'm just playing , man .
i'll be in the truck .
i'm gonna kill you .
