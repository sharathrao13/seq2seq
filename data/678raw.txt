it's this place , lancaster .
the turkana are right .
it's cursed .
sarah .
you don't understand .
what they did to me in the camp .
they ...
there's nothing left to bleed .
there is something here , something evil .
sarah , it's so much easier to believe in evil as an entity ... but it's not .
it's a purely human condition inside all of us .
did bession talk about what he found under the church?
there's an ancient temple below , a pagan place ... where they used to conduct sacrifices , human sacrifices .
why would they build a church on top of something like that?
perhaps to purify the site .
but then why bury it?
no !
merrin !
you better come with me .
jefferies didn't show up for the dig this morning .
he wasn't in his room , so they came to the bar and they found ...
chief sebituana's baby was stillborn last night .
he blames the whites .
you think the turkana took jefferies?
i think this place is on the verge of an uprising .
i've contacted major granville .
a detachment will be here by this afternoon .
you disagree?
in my experience , bringing soldiers into a situation is always a bad idea .
who buried them?
everybody died .
who buried them?
all right !
halt !
major granville .
hello , peter .
come on !
out you get !
move it , wilkins !
any answers on jefferies?
i'm afraid not .
well , you did the right thing calling me , father .
i've been in these situations before ... and you have to stay on top of ...
on top of these people .
i'm not sure the turkana are responsible for what's happening here , major .
major granville?
this dig is too important to jeopardize ... and until i'm satisfied that the excavation is secure ... the british army will assume complete control .
the turkana won't like the show of force .
i'm not concerned with what the turkana like , mr. merrin !
if they start any more trouble , they will have to answer ... to the might of his majesty king george .
you cannot be here .
please tell sebituana i'm sorry for his loss .
you are not welcome here .
i want to know about the plague that destroyed this village 50 years ago .
it was not a plague .
so , what was it?
the evil in your church ... it has taken emekwi's youngest son ... and it is getting stronger .
you must abandon your work ... or we'll be forced to stop you .
so you don't want to tell me?
he says he doesn't have to tell you because it's happening again ... right now .
you don't bury your dead .
you cremate them .
yes .
then who's buried in that graveyard?
i'm sorry .
what are you ...
i'm sorry .
daddy .
i will shoot 10 , priest , and you will choose .
i can't do that .
no !
no !
now you choose ... or i will kill them all .
are you praying ... to god?
shoot me .
god is not here today , priest .
papa !
they're empty !
what?
i dug up three graves .
they were all empty .
what happened here?
i i don't know .
oh , yes , you do .
you've been lying to me since we got here .
let go of me .
damn it !
there are crosses on the graves !
there are crosses on the coffins !
the church buried them , didn't they?
didn't they?
yes .
why?
what were they hiding?
that this place is damned .
no !
you asked the question !
now you're gonna listen to the answer !
there was a massacre here ... 1, 500 years ago .
an army from the west , led by two priests ... searching for the origin of a powerful evil .
but when they got here that evil consumed them ... turning the soldiers against each other in a bloodbath .
only a single priest survived .
when that priest made it back to the emperor justinian ... he ordered that a church be built over the site and then buried ... to seal the evil inside .
all mention of it was to be stricken from the history texts forever .
but it wasn't?
no .
in 1893 ... a vatican researcher found an ancient letter in the archives .
four priests came to examine the site ... enlisting the help of the people of this valley in their search ... and they all disappeared .
where did they go?
no one knows .
the vatican ordered a cover up ... the false graveyard ... the tale of a plague to ... to scare people away .
and then the british stumbled across it .
and i was sent here to see if the legend was real .
what legend?
that after the war in heaven ... this is the spot where lucifer fell .
god brought you here , lancaster .
leave me alone .
no .
the devil is here ... inside that boy .
the turkana know it .
they came to drive the devil from him , and he almost killed them .
you can't run from this .
you must help me .
i can't .
but you've seen what's going on here .
you have to believe .
i believe in nothing .
found jefferies .
over there !
as you were !
major granville !
wait !
get him down .
get him down !
you all right , major?
savages .
major !
major !
bloody savages .
why are you here?
granville !
you have no business to be here !
you must leave .
granville !
you people have plundered our ancestors .
granville !
you must return turkana to us now .
let me through !
it is time to go .
you have already polluted our lives .
you came here with your evil .
we knew peace before you came .
granville !
no !
no !
no !
no !
they think it's inside joseph !
they believe the evil is upon us !
chuma !
merrin .
they believe it is inside joseph .
they are going to kill him .
now , please ... go !
you animals !
turn this way !
i don't like it .
come on !
three boxes of ammunition !
sir .
the turkana are preparing to attack .
leave me .

i said , leave me .
yes , sir .
we must leave now .
why?

why?
turkana are coming to kill him .
it's a sandstorm .
it won't let us leave .
we have to hide him .

the turkana won't go in there .
it's his only chance .

in your faithfulness destroy them .
where's your god now , merrin?
fucking his only son while you call out his name?
he doesn't care about this whore .
but you do ... because you want to shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass .
you can't have her , priest .
the whore is mine .
and i'll kill her before i let you take her from me .
from the souls made to the image and likeness of god ...
i cast you out !
you're a killer , merrin .
you looked them in the eye , pointed your finger , and they died .
god is not here today , priest .
oh , yes , he is .
you're going to watch him die , merrin .
fail him like you failed all the others .
god , spare this child , for he is innocent ... and deserves your blessing .
