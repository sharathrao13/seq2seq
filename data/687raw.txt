this is a story of an ordinary little boy ... ... named charlie bucket .
he was not faster or stronger or more clever than other children .
his family was not rich or powerful or well connected .
in fact , they barely had enough to eat .
charlie bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world .
he just didn't know it yet .
evening , buckets .
evening .
hi , dad .
soup's almost ready , darling .
don't suppose there's anything extra to put in , love .
oh , well .
nothing goes better with cabbage than cabbage .
charlie ... ... l found something i think you'll like .
charlie's father worked at the local toothpaste factory .
the hours were long , and the pay was terrible ... ... yet occasionally , there were unexpected surprises .
it's exactly what i need .
what is it , charlie?
dad found it , just the piece i needed .
what piece was it?
a head for willy wonka .
well , how wonderful .
it's quite a likeness .
you think so?
think so?
i know so .
i saw willy wonka with my own two eyes .
i used to work for him , you know .
you did?
i did .
he did .
he did .
i love grapes .
of course , i was a much younger man in those days .
willy wonka began with a single store on cherry street .
but the whole world wanted his candy .
mr. wonka .
yeah?
we need more wonka bars ...
... and we're out of chocolate birds .
birds?
birds .
well , then we'll need to make some more .
here .
now open .
the man was a genius .
did you know he invented a new way of making chocolate ice cream ... ... so that it stays cold for hours without a freezer?
you can even leave it lying in the sun on a hot day , and it won't go runny .
but that's impossible .
but willy wonka did it .
before long ... ... he decided to build a proper chocolate factory .
the largest chocolate factory in history .
fifty times as big as any other .
grandpa , don't make it gross .
tell him about the lndian prince .
he'd like to hear about that .
you mean , prince pondicherry?
well , prince pondicherry wrote a letter to mr. wonka ... ... and asked him to come all the way out to lndia ... ... and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate .
it will have 1 00 rooms , and everything will be made of either dark or light chocolate .
true to his word , the bricks were chocolate ... ... and the cement holding them together was chocolate .
all the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate as well .
so were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture .
it is perfect in every way .
yeah , but it won't last long .
you better start eating right now .
oh , nonsense .
i will not eat my palace .
i intend to live in it .
but mr. wonka was right , of course .
soon after this , there came a very hot day with a boiling sun .
the prince sent an urgent telegram requesting a new palace ... ... but willy wonka was facing problems of his own .
all the other chocolate makers , you see , had grown jealous of mr. wonka .
they began sending in spies to steal his secret recipes .
fickelgruber started making an ice cream that would never melt .
prodnose came out with a chewing gum that never lost its flavor .
then slugworth began making candy balloons ... ... that you could blow up to incredible sizes .
the thievery got so bad ... ... that one day , without warning ... ... mr. wonka told every single one of his workers to go home .
he announced that he was closing his chocolate factory forever .
i'm closing my chocolate factory forever .
i'm sorry .
but it didn't close forever .
it's open right now .
yes , well , sometimes when grownups say " forever , " they mean " a very long time .
such as , " i feel like i've eaten nothing but cabbage soup forever .
now , pops .
the factory did close , charlie .
and it seemed like it was going to be closed forever .
then one day we saw smoke rising from the chimneys .
the factory was back in business .
did you get your job back?
no .
no one did .
but there must be people working there .
think about it , charlie .
have you ever seen a single person ... ... going into that factory or coming out of it?
no .
the gates are always closed .
exactly .
but then , who's running the machines?
nobody knows , charlie .
it certainly is a mystery .
hasn't someone asked mr. wonka?
nobody sees him anymore .
he never comes out .
the only thing that comes out of that place is the candy ... ... already packed and addressed .
i'd give anything in the world just to go in one more time ... ... and see what's become of that amazing factory .
well , you won't , because you can't .
no one can .
it's a mystery , and it will always be a mystery .
that little factory of yours , charlie , is as close as any of us is ever going to get .
come on , charlie .
i think it's time we let your grandparents get some sleep .
good night , grandpa george .
night , charlie .
night night .
chair .
thank you , dear .
night , grandpa joe .
good night , grandma georgina .
nothing's impossible , charlie .
good night .
night , charlie .
sleep well .
indeed , that very night , the impossible had already been set in motion .
dear people of the world ... ... i , willy wonka ... ... have decided to allow five children to visit my factory this year .
in addition , one of these children shall receive a special prize ... ... beyond anything you could ever imagine .
five golden tickets have been hidden ... ... underneath the ordinary wrapping paper of five ordinary wonka bars .
the bars may be anywhere ... ... in any shop , in any street , in any town , in any country in the world .
wouldn't it be something , charlie , to open a bar of candy ... ... and find a golden ticket inside?
i know , but i only get one bar a year , for my birthday .
well , it's your birthday next week .
you have as much chance as anybody does .
balderdash .
the kids who are going to find the golden tickets ... ... are the ones who can afford to buy candy bars every day .
our charlie gets only one a year .
he doesn't have a chance .
everyone has a chance , charlie .
mark my words , the kid who finds the first ticket ... ... will be fat , fat , fat .
augustus .
this way .
i am eating the wonka bar ... ... and i taste something that is not chocolate ... ... or coconut ... ... or walnut or peanut butter ... ... or nougat ... ... or butter brittle or caramel or sprinkles .
so i look ... ... and i find the golden ticket .
augustus , how did you celebrate?
i eat more candy .
we knew augustus would find the golden ticket .
he eats so many candy bars a day ... ... that it was not possible for him not to find one .
yes , it is good , augustus . golden ticket claimed and four more ....
told you it'd be a porker .
what a repulsive boy .
only four golden tickets left .
now that they've found one , things will really get crazy . of every shape , size and hue .
veruca .
can you spell that for us , please?
v e r u c a. veruca salt .
as soon as my little veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets ... ... l started buying all the wonka bars i could lay my hands on .
thousands of them .
hundreds of thousands .
i'm in the nut business , you see .
morning , ladies .
from now on , you can stop shelling peanuts ... ... and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead .
three days went by , and we had no luck .
oh , it was terrible .
my veruca got more and more upset each day .
where's my golden ticket?
i want my golden ticket .
well , gentlemen , i just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that .
i vowed i would keep searching until i could give her what she wanted .
and finally , i found her a ticket .
daddy , i want another pony .
she's even worse than the fat boy .
i don't think that was really fair .
she didn't find the ticket herself .
don't worry about it , charlie .
that man spoils his daughter .
and no good ever comes from spoiling a child like that .
charlie , mum and i thought ... ... maybe you wanna open your birthday present tonight .
here you are .
maybe i should wait till morning .
like hell .
pop .
all together , we're 381 years old .
we don't wait .
now , charlie , you mustn't feel too disappointed ... ... you know , if you don't get the ....
whatever happens , you'll still have the candy .
ah , well .
that's that .
we'll share it .
oh , no , charlie .
not your birthday present .
it's my candy bar , and i'll do what i want with it .
thank you , darling .
thank you , charlie .
bless you .
all right , let's see who found it .
the third ticket was found by miss violet beauregarde .
these are just some of the 263 trophies and medals my violet has won .
i'm a gum chewer mostly , but when i heard about these ticket things ... ... l laid off the gum , switched to candy bars .
she's just a driven young woman .
i don't know where she gets it .
i'm the junior world champion gum chewer .
this piece of gum i'm chewing right now ... ... l've been working on for three months solid .
that's a record .
of course , i did have my share of trophies , mostly baton .
so it says that one kid's gonna get this special prize , better than all the rest .
i don't care who those other four are .
that kid , it's gonna be me .
tell them why , violet .
because i'm a winner .
what a beastly girl .
despicable .
you don't know what we're talking about .
dragonflies?
but wait , this is just in .
the fourth golden ticket has been found by a boy called mike teavee .
all you had to do was track the manufacturing dates ... ... offset by weather and the derivative of the nikkei lndex .
a retard could figure it out .
most of the time i don't know what he's talking about .
you know , kids these days , what with all the technology ....
die !
die !
die !
doesn't seem like they stay kids very long .
ln the end , i only had to buy one candy bar .
and how did it taste?
i don't know .
i hate chocolate .
well , it's a good thing you're going to a chocolate factory , you ungrateful little
that question is , who will be the winner of the last gold?
dad?
yes , charlie?
why aren't you at work?
oh , well , the toothpaste factory thought they'd give me a bit of time off .
like summer vacation?
sure .
something like that .
in fact , it wasn't like a vacation at all .
the upswing in candy sales had led to a rise in cavities ... ... which led to a rise in toothpaste sales .
with the extra money , the factory had decided to modernize ... ... eliminating mr. bucket's job .
we were barely making ends meet as it was .
you'll find another job .
until then , i'll just well , i'll just thin down the soup a little more .
don't worry , mr. bucket , our luck will change .
i know it .
charlie .
my secret hoard .
you and i are going to have one more fling ... ... at finding that last ticket .
you sure you want to spend your money on that?
of course i'm sure .
here .
run down to the nearest store ... ... and buy the first wonka candy bar you see .
bring it straight back , and we'll open it together .
such a good boy , really .
such a good ....
grandpa?
you fell asleep .
have you got it?
which end should we open first?
just do it quick , like a band aid .
did you see that some kid in russia found the last golden ticket?
yes , it was in the paper this morning .
good boy .
come on , george .
good boy .
one wonka whipple scrumptious fudgemallow delight , please .
okay .
here you go .
the nerve of some people .
i know .
forging a ticket .
come on .
it's a golden ticket .
you found wonka's last golden ticket .
ln my shop too !
listen .
i'll buy it from you .
i'll give you $50 and a new bicycle .
are you crazy?
i'd give him $500 for that ticket .
you wanna sell me your ticket for $500 , young man?
that's enough of that .
leave the kid alone .
listen .
don't let anyone have it .
take it straight home , you understand?
thank you .
mom !
dad !
i found it !
the last golden ticket !
it's mine !
here .
read it aloud .
let's hear exactly what it says .
greetings to you , the lucky finder of this golden ticket , from mr. willy wonka .
i shake you warmly by the hand .
for now , i do invite you to come to my factory ... ... and be my guest for one whole day .
i , willy wonka , will conduct you around the factory myself ... ... showing you everything there is to see .
afterwards , when it is time to leave ... ... you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks ... ... each one filled with all the chocolate you could ever eat .
and remember , one of you lucky five children will receive an extra prize ... ... beyond your wildest imagination .
now , here are your instructions .
on the 1 st of february , you must come to the factory gates at 1 0 a . m . sharp .
you're allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you .
until then , willy wonka .
the 1 st of february .
but that's tomorrow .
then there's not a moment to lose .
wash your face , comb your hair , scrub your hands , brush your teeth , blow your nose .
and get that mud off your pants .
now we must all try and keep very calm .
who is going with charlie to the factory?
i will .
i'll take him .
you leave it to me .
how about you , dear?
don't you think you ought to go?
well , grandpa joe seems to know more about it than we do , and ....
provided , of course , he feels well enough .
no .
we're not going .
a woman offered me $500 for the ticket .
i bet someone else would pay more .
we need the money more than we need the chocolate .
young man , come here .
there's plenty of money out there .
they print more every day .
but this ticket ... ... there's only five of them in the whole world ... ... and that's all there's ever going to be .
only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money .
are you a dummy?
no , sir .
then get that mud off your pants .
you've got a factory to go to .
daddy , i want to go in .
it's 9 : 59 , sweetheart .
make time go faster .
do you think mr. wonka will recognize you?
hard to say .
it's been years .
eyes on the prize , violet .
eyes on the prize .
please enter .
come forward .
close the gates .
dear visitors ... ... it is my great pleasure to welcome you to my humble factory .
and who am i?
well ....
willy wonka , willy wonka
the amazing chocolatier
willy wonka , willy wonka
everybody give a cheer !
hooray !
he's modest , clever and so smart
he barely can restrain it
with so much generosity
there is no way to contain it !
to contain it to contain , to contain , to contain !
hooray !
willy wonka , willy wonka
he's the one that you're about to meet
willy wonka , willy wonka
he's the genius who just can't be beat
the magician and the chocolate wiz
the best darn guy who ever lived
willy wonka , here he is !
the amazing chocolatier
wasn't that just magnificent?
i was worried it was getting a little dodgy in the middle part , but then that finale ....
who are you?
he's willy wonka .
really?
good morning , starshine .
the earth says hello .
dear guests , greetings .
welcome to the factory .
i shake you warmly by the hand .
my name is willy wonka .
then shouldn't you be up there?
i couldn't very well watch the show from up there , now , could i , little girl?
mr. wonka , i don't know if you'll remember me ... ... but i used to work here in the factory .
were you one of those despicable spies who tried to steal ... ... my life's work and sell it to parasitic , copycat , candy making cads?
no , sir .
then wonderful .
welcome back .
let's get a move on , kids .
don't you want to know our names?
can't imagine how it would matter .
come quickly .
far too much to see .
just drop your coats anywhere .
mr. wonka?
sure is toasty in here .
what?
i have to keep it warm in here .
my workers are used to an extremely hot climate .
they just can't stand the cold .
who are the workers?
all in good time .
now ....
mr. wonka , i'm violet beauregarde .
i don't care .
well , you should care .
because i'm gonna win the special prize at the end .
well , you do seem confident , and confidence is key .
i'm veruca salt .
it's very nice to meet you , sir .
i always thought a verruca was a type of wart ... ... you got on the bottom of your foot .
i am augustus gloop .
i love your chocolate .
i can see that .
so do l .
i never expected to have so much in common .
you .
you're mike teavee .
you're the little devil who cracked the system .
and you .
well , you're just lucky to be here , aren't you?
and the rest of you must be their
parents .
yeah .
moms and dads .
dad?
papa?
okay , then .
let's move along .
would you like some chocolate?
sure .
then you should've brought some .
let's be friends .
best friends .
an important room , this .
after all , it is a chocolate factory .
then why is the door so small?
that's to keep all the great big chocolatey flavor inside .
now , do be careful , my dear children .
don't lose your heads .
don't get overexcited .
just keep very calm .
it's beautiful .
what?
oh , yeah , it's very beautiful .
every drop of the river ... ... is hot , melted chocolate of the finest quality .
the waterfall is most important .
mixes the chocolate .
churns it up .
makes it light and frothy .
by the way ... ... no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall , my dear children .
and you can take that to the bank .
people .
those pipes ... ... suck up the chocolate and carry it away all over the factory .
thousands of gallons an hour .
yeah .
and do you like my meadow?
try some of my grass .
please have a blade .
please do .
it's so delectable and so darn good looking .
you can eat the grass?
of course you can .
everything in this room is eatable .
even i'm eatable .
but that is called cannibalism , my dear children ... ... and is , in fact , frowned upon in most societies .
yeah .
enjoy .
go on .
scoot , scoot .
son .
please .
dad , he said , " enjoy .
why hold on to it?
why not start a new piece?
because then i wouldn't be a champion .
i'd be a loser , like you .
daddy , look over there .
what is it?
it's a little person .
over there , by the waterfall .
there's two of them .
there's more than two .
where do they come from?
who are they?
are they real people?
of course they're real people .
they're oompa loompas .
oompa loompas?
lmported , direct from loompaland .
there's no such place .
what?
mr. wonka , i teach high school geography , and i'm here to tell you
well , then you'll know all about it , and , oh , what a terrible country it is .
the whole place is nothing but thick jungles ... ... infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world .
hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible , wicked whangdoodles .
i went to loompaland looking for exotic new flavors for candy .
instead ... ... i found the oompa loompas .
they lived in tree houses to escape from the fierce creatures who lived below .
the oompa loompas ate nothing but green caterpillars , which tasted revolting .
red beetles , the bark of the bong bong tree .
all of them beastly ... ... but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars .
but the food they longed for the most was the cocoa bean .
an oompa loompa was lucky if he found three or four cocoa beans a year .
but , oh , how they craved them .
all they'd ever think about was cocoa beans .
they are such wonderful workers .
i feel i must warn you , though , they are rather mischievous .
always making jokes .
augustus , my child , that is not a good thing you do !
hey , little boy .
my chocolate must be untouched by human hands .
he'll drown .
he can't swim .
save him !
augustus !
no !
augustus !
augustus , watch out !
there he goes .
call the fire brigade !
it's a wonder how that pipe is big enough .
it isn't big enough .
he's slowing down .
he's gonna stick .
i think he has .
he's blocked the whole pipe .
look .
the oompa loompas .
what are they doing?
they're going to treat us to a little song .
it is quite a special occasion .
they haven't had a fresh audience in many a moon .
augustus gloop , augustus gloop
the great big , greedy nincompoop
augustus gloop , so big and vile so greedy , foul and infantile
come on ! " we cried " the time is ripe
to send him shooting up the pipe !
but don't , dear children , be alarmed
augustus gloop will not be harmed
augustus gloop will not be harmed
although , of course , we must admit
he will be altered quite a bit
slowly , wheels go round and round
and cogs begin to grind and pound
this greedy brute , this louse's ear
is loved by people everywhere
for who could hate or bear a grudge
against a luscious bit of fudge?
bravo !
well done !
aren't they delightful?
aren't they charming?
i do say , that all seemed rather rehearsed .
like they knew it was gonna happen .
oh , poppycock .
where is my son?
where does that pipe go to?
that pipe , it just so happens to lead ... ... directly to the room where i make delicious ... ... strawberry flavored , chocolate coated fudge .
then he will be made into strawberry flavored , chocolate coated fudge .
they'll be selling him by the pound all over the world?
no .
i wouldn't allow it .
the taste would be terrible .
can you imagine augustus flavored , chocolate coated gloop?
no one would buy it .
i want you to take mrs. gloop up to the fudge room , okay?
help her find her son .
take a long stick and start poking around in the big chocolate mixing barrel , okay?
mr. wonka?
why would augustus 'name already be in the oompa loompa song , unless?
lmprovisation is a parlor trick .
anyone can do it .
you , little girl .
say something .
anything .
chewing gum .
chewing gum is really gross chewing gum , i hate the most
see?
exactly the same .
no , it isn't .
you really shouldn't mumble .
because i can't understand a word you're saying .
now , on with the tour .
are the oompa loompas really joking?
of course they're joking .
that boy will be fine .
what's so funny?
i think it's from all those doggone cocoa beans .
hey , by the way , did you guys know that chocolate contains a property ... ... that triggers the release of endorphins?
gives one the feeling of being in love .
you don't say .
all aboard .
onward !
here .
try some of this .
it'll do you good .
you look starved to death .
it's great .
that's because it's mixed by waterfall .
the waterfall is most important .
mixes the chocolate , churns it up , makes it light and frothy .
by the way , no other factory in the world  you already said that .
you're all quite short , aren't you?
well , yeah .
we're children .
well , that's no excuse .
i was never as short as you .
you were once .
was not .
know why?
because i distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head .
look at your short , little arms .
you could never reach .
do you even remember what it was like being a kid?
oh , boy , do l .
do l?
in fact , willy wonka hadn't thought about his childhood for years .
trick or treat !
trick or treat !
trick or treat !
