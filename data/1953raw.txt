downfall
i feel as if i should be angry with that child , that ... naive young girl .
or that i must not forgive her ... for not recognising the nature of that monster .
for not being aware of what she was getting into .
and especially that i went along without thinking .
because i wasn't a fanatical nazi .
'no , i'm not doing it .
i don't want to go to the fhrer's headquarters . '
but i didn't do that .
i was too curious .
i also didn't realise ... that destiny would take me somewhere i didn't want to be .
but , nevertheless , i find it hard to forgive myself .
the ladies are here .
it's confirmed .
they can pass .
'wolfsschanze 'headquarters of the fhrer
november 1942 rastenburg , east prussia
sit down , ladies .
one moment .
the fhrer is feeding his dog .
he'll see you in a short while .
can you tell us ...
how are we supposed to address the fhrer?
heil , mein fhrer .
and the nazi salute?
that won't be necessary ... since the fhrer isn't looking for a soldier , but for a secretary .
act as normal and relaxed as you can .
i'll see if if he has time for you .
mein fhrer , the ladies from berlin are here .
thank you for coming in the middle of the night .
sometimes , during a war , one is not in control of time .
can i ask your name?
margarethe lorenz .
where are you from?
from fulda .
and what is your name?
ursula puttkammer .
heil , mein fhrer .
no need for that .
where are you from?
frankfurt am main , mein fh ...
hannah potrovsky , born and raised in berlin .
in pankow , to be precise .
hedwig brandt from crailsheim , schwaben .
and you are?
traudl humps .
i'm from munich .
a lady from munich .
shall we start then , frulein humps?
my blondi won't hurt you .
she's very intelligent .
she's much smarter than most people .
first , sit down , please .
don't be nervous .
i make many mistakes during dictation .
you won't make nearly as many .
you're very young .
how old are you?
22 , mein fhrer .
my german fellow countrymen and women ... ... fellow party members .
it is , i think , rather special ... that , after 20 years of service , a man still stands in front of his supporters ... ... and that in all those 20 years , his program never needed to be modified .
i suggest we try it again .
i did it .
he hired me .
berlin 20 april 1945 hitler's 56th birthday two and a half years later
take cover .
hurry .
continue .
get that off the street .
take cover .
that's artillery fire .
don't be silly .
where would it be coming from?
you're right .
these are no planes , this is artillery .
it's the russians .
what a birthday present .
where is that cannon fire coming from?
happy birthday , mein fhrer .
the city centre of berlin is under fire .
grenades have hit near the brandenburger tor and the reichstag .
where did they come from?
we don't know yet .
i have koller on the line .
give me koller .
koller , do you know berlin is under artillery fire?
no .
can't you hear the shooting?
no , i'm in wildpark werder .
berlin is chaotic .
apparently , the russians captured a railway bridge over the oder .
the enemy has no railway artillery near the oder .
it's not long range artillery .
the anti aircraft defence near the zoo bunker reports they're 10 to 12 ... ... cm calibres .
the russians have positions near marzahn .
that's only 12 kilometres from the centre .
are the russians that close?
they should hang the entire luftwaffe leadership .
this is unheard of .
the russians are at 12 kilometres from the city centre .
nobody told me anything .
i had to ask .
maybe it's long range artillery , after all .
that railway bridge over the oder ...
nonsense .
that himmler , such a pompous buffoon .
party bosses , everywhere .
they make me so sick .
the fhrer starts 'clausewitz 'today .
berlin as a front city .
he won't be able to keep the city .
if the fhrer stays here , the reich will go down with him .
we have to talk him out of it .
talk to hewel .
he's the only diplomat with any influence on him .
hewel tried everything .
it's useless .
talk to your sister in law , then .
why not?
you're married to the sister of eva braun .
we must try everything .
berlin is almost surrounded .
you're still young .
you'll be a father soon .
do you want to die here?
absolutely not .
gentlemen , the fhrer .
everything out .
quickly .
we're leaving in two hours .
what's going on?
we're leaving .
'clausewitz 'has started .
all the ministries and departments are leaving berlin .
and who's going to look after the people and the soldiers?
don't ask me , professor .
this is insane .
professor .
i won't allow the evacuation of my office .
is that so?
food supply would collapse .
a good soldier can always find food .
and when there's fighting all over the city , where does he get it?
the population .
it's irresponsible .
it's an order from the fhrer .
as department head , i report to the ss and to himmler .
but as a doctor , i'm part of the wehrmacht and they're not leaving yet .
keep that in mind .
the professor stays in berlin .
get him the proper papers .
we're leaving .
everything for germany .
heil , mein fhrer .
fhrer , i ...
heil , mein fhrer .
they're in such a hurry to get away from here .
the brown nosing is the worst .
they say 'sieg heil '. but they think 'lick my ... you know what . '
leave berlin .
it is not too late yet .
too late?
hewel , come here for a moment .
i'm sure you agree we should contact the allies ... ... and start conducting politics .
certainly .
we need politics .
politics?
i don't do politics anymore .
i'm fed up with it .
when i'm dead , you'll have plenty of time for politics .
it's good , dear himmler .
my loyal heinrich .
it's good .
just go .
he has no strength left .
what did you expect from a vegetarian teetotaller?
seriously , though , fegelein .
i'm taking control now .
berlin will fall in a couple of days .
when the fhrer's dead , who will the allies negotiate with?
why do you think they'll negotiate with you?
the nazi state and my ss are needed to maintain order .
one hour with eisenhower and he'll feel the same way .
the first contact has been made .
careful , that's high treason .
fegelein , i have other concerns .
should i give eisenhower the nazi salute or shake his hand?
look at that .
the best guests always arrive late .
leaving already , gentlemen?
i wanted to talk to you .
the scorched earth order ...
i really have to go now .
come and see me one day in hohenlychen .
i'm going north to help with the battle of berlin there .
you know , speer ...
there's an advantage to those bombings .
it's easier to clean up debris than to demolish everything ourselves .
when the war will be over , reconstruction will be quick .
we spent thousands of hours together with these replicas .
you're a true genius , speer .
yes , absolutely .
only you and i know that the third reich would be inconceivable ... ... with only warehouses and factories .
skyscrapers and hotels .
this third reich will be a treasury full of art and culture ... ... that will survive thousands of years .
we see , before us , the ancient cities , the acropolis ...
we see the medieval cities ... the cathedrals ... ... and we know that the people need that .
indeed , speer .
that was my vision ... ... and it still is .
mein fhrer , if you want to realize these plans , you must leave berlin .
eva , you say something .
he's the fhrer .
he knows what's best .
you must leave berlin .
the russians almost have us isolated .
i can't do that , my child .
i would be like a lama priest with an empty prayer wheel .
i have to solve the problem , here in berlin , or perish .
speer ... ... what do you think?
you have to be on the stage when the curtain falls .
reload .
go away .
leave me alone .
how old are you?
twelve?
and you?
fourteen?
why are you here?
to play at war?
go home .
who are you?
what do you want?
i want my son .
alive .
you should be proud .
he destroyed two tanks .
the fhrer will decorate him for it , today .
you're still young .
at which front did you fight?
i haven't had the honour yet .
count yourself lucky .
send the children home .
we'll defend this position to the last man .
which position?
this is not a position , it's a trap .
the russians will come from two sides and you won't be able to get out .
we'll shoot back .
what with?
with the anti aircraft guns .
the russians will arrive with several armies , tanks and heavy artillery .
do you really think you'll last even five minutes?
we promised the fhrer .
don't you understand?
the war is lost .
coward .
go away .
right now .
if you're still here when the russians arrive , you'll all be dead .
the 9th army had to retreat or they would have been decimated ...
we won't retreat the 9th army .
busse must fight where he stands .
fhrer , then the 9th army is lost .
we'll push back the soviet armies in the north and east ... ... with a ruthless , mighty attack .
using which units?
steiner will attack from the north and join the 9th army .
the 9th army is unable to move .
the enemy outnumbers us ten times .
wenck's 12th army must support them .
the 12th army is approaching the elbe .
then it must turn around .
then the western front would be open .
do you doubt my orders?
i think i've been clear enough .
the allies will see that only we can stop the bolsheviks .
we have to keep berlin and make a deal with the americans .
mohnke , you're here .
mein fhrer .
today , 'clausewitz 'started .
berlin will be a front city .
you will be the commander of the defensive circle around the citadel .
we'll fight until the last man , in berlin .
there are still three million civilians here .
they have to be evacuated .
i understand your concern , mohnke .
but we have to be cold as ice .
we can't spend any energy on so called civilians .
with all due respect , what will happen to the women and children ... ... and the thousands of wounded and elderly?
in a war such as this one , there are no civilians .
the fhrer has lost all sense of reality .
he's moving divisions around that no longer exist .
gruppe steiner has been scattered , yet steiner must attack .
madness .
but why don't you tell him that?
he doesn't listen to reason .
something has to happen .
are you crazy?
he'll throw us out .
we're soldiers .
we took an oath .
does that mean we can't use our own brains anymore?
and that's coming from you?
a ruthless careerist?
i beg your pardon?
where were you?
none of your business .
the most successful tank hunters of the berlin hitler jugend stand before you .
i'm proud of you .
this boy took out two tanks using anti tank shells .
his name is peter kranz .
so you're peter .
i wish my generals were as brave as you .
very good .
you've made history .
and when germania will rise from these ruins ... ... you will be the heroes .
heil , to you .
i don't know about you , but i prefer air raids .
what will happen to us?
i could go if i wanted to .
but everybody is deserting him .
we can't all go , can we?
i can't go either .
i wouldn't know where to go .
my parents and all my friends warned me .
don't get involved with the nazis .
'hello , i made a mistake '?
'when things went wrong , i admitted my mistake . '
life will go on .
what do you think , herr oberst?
we have to go .
go where?
i don't know .
wherever they need us .
let's go upstairs .
we'll party .
come on .
come , children .
we should have fun today .
wherever the enemy goes , all they find is destruction .
that's the death sentence for the german people .
no power , no gas , no drinking water , no coal , no traffic .
if you destroy everything , our country will go back to the middle ages .
this order denies the people any chance of survival .
if the war is lost , what does it matter that the people are lost too?
the primary necessities of life of the german people aren't relevant , right now .
on the contrary .
we'd best destroy them ourselves .
our people turned out weak ... ... and according to the laws of nature , they should die out .
they're your people .
you're their fhrer .
what remains after this battle ... ... is only the inferior .
the superior will have fallen .
come along .
you have to dance .
care to dance , frulein braun?
i'd love to .
may i?
go ahead .
what's wrong?
we have to leave berlin , eva .
you must convince him .
or else , come with me .
you'll die .
can somebody play some music?
i want to dance .
dance .
do you have a request?
as long as it swings .
traudl .
it's all so unreal .
it's like a dream you can't get out of .
it keeps on going .
gerda , i don't feel well .
traudl , come .
i did not move ...
i did not move my command post .
to the west?
how so?
i'm at 1000 meters from the enemy .
general .
and , general?
i'll be executed .
what?
why?
they think i moved my command post to the west .
be sensible , general .
come along .
schenck .
mohnke .
i'm under the chancellery .
i'm commander of the citadel now .
i need help .
that will be difficult .
everything's gone .
my assistant and i are the only ones here .
you're a doctor , aren't you?
yes , an internist .
commandeer a car and bring all the medication ... ... you can find , to me .
i'll do my best .
thanks .
hurry .
i need to talk to the fhrer .
what about?
i'm going to be executed .
wait here .
your weapon , please .
not here .
guard post 2 .
understood .
general ...
not you .
what's going on here?
why am i going to be executed?
you know that any evasive manoeuvre towards the west is forbidden .
officers who don't obey , must be executed .
what do you mean?
my troops have been fighting for days .
my command post is a kilometre away from the front line .
continue .
do you see this?
i don't want you to use that tone with me .
and now , do whatever you feel you must .
it's best if you tell this to the fhrer yourself .
come along .
you can't pass , oberst .
i have to get into the hospital .
we need medication .
there's nobody left .
they all took off .
and the wounded?
how should i know?
i'm going to have a look .
you stay here .
be very careful .
there are lots of russians here .
see that?
that's where the reich ends .
behind it , is russkie land .
may i?
he's damned stubborn .
why doesn't he let me do that?
i should have been back by now .
are you sure the fhrer still needs me?
drink .
fhrer's orders .
you made a big impression on the fhrer .
but you don't think steiner will attack , do you?
i doubt whether steiner is able to do anything ... ... but you probably know that better than i do .
if steiner doesn't attack , berlin is lost .
the fhrer was impressed with your report .
he puts you in command of the defence of berlin .
i'd have preferred it if he executed me .
let them get closer .
tank alert .
take it easy .
wait , kid .
they're still too far .
is it german artillery that i hear?
i'm afraid not .
but hasn't steiner's attack started?
you have to go as fast as you can .
time is running out .
but the fhrer has the situation under control .
steiner will make all the difference .
he says it will change military history .
everybody , but the fhrer , knows that's a fantasy .
i even wonder if he believes it himself .
why would he be playing games?
what does he have to lose?
i don't believe a word of it .
the enemy made a breakthrough .
they took zossen and are advancing towards stahnsdorf .
they're at the northern city border , between frohnau and pankow .
in the east , they reached lichtenberg , mahlsdorf and karlshorst .
if steiner attacks , everything will be alright .
mein fhrer ...
steiner ...
steiner didn't have enough force .
the attack didn't take place .
keitel , jodl , krebs and burgdorf .
that was an order .
steiner's attack was an order .
how dare you ignore my orders?
is this what it came to?
the military , everybody lied to me .
even the ss .
the generals are no more than a bunch of disloyal cowards .
i don't allow that ...
cowards , traitors and incompetents .
fhrer , this is outrageous .
the generals are the scum of the german people .
no sense of honour .
you call yourself general because you spent years at the academy ... ... where you only learnt to use knife and fork .
for years , the military obstructed me .
all you ever did is thwart me .
i should have had ... ... all the high officers executed .
like stalin did .
i never went to the academy .
but i conquered all of europe on my own .
traitors .
i've been betrayed and deceived from the start .
such enormous betrayal of the german people .
but all these traitors will pay .
with their own blood .
they will drown in their own blood .
relax , gerda .
all my orders have been ignored .
how can i be a leader under these circumstances?
it's over .
the war is lost .
but if you think this means i'll leave berlin ... ... you're wrong .
i'd rather shoot a bullet through my head .
do what you want .
the fhrer wasn't serious about killing himself , was he?
frau junge , frau christian .
get changed .
in one hour , a plane will take you south .
everything is lost .
completely lost .
you know i'll stay with you .
you can't send me away .
i'm staying too , mein fhrer .
now what?
time to end this charade .
do you want us to stop fighting?
that's inconceivable .
the fhrer doesn't want us to capitulate .
no more november 1918 .
ever .
but he doesn't want to be in charge anymore .
'do what you want '.
nobody can replace him .
he's the fhrer .
the fhrer's confused .
he'll recover .
great .
and then what?
no capitulation .
that was never his intention .
we owe it to him .
hollow phrases .
we have to act now .
or it will be too late .
you're only looking after yourself .
mind your words .
damn .
we'll never get out of here alive .
it's all over .
we've got to wait .
even the fhrer doesn't believe in it anymore .
what will happen to us?
gnsche says there's a tunnel that goes under the russian lines .
why did you say you wanted to stay with him?
i don't know .
honestly .
it stopped .
let's go for a walk .
traudl .
look here .
i'm lighting another one .
let's go down again .
where do they come from?
volkssturm .
drafted this afternoon .
they have to get out of the field of fire .
the volkssturm is under the direct command of dr. goebbels .
i want them to go away from there .
this is insane .
i'll take the responsibility .
i think this is wrong .
great .
stop .
lights out .
stop .
stay where you are .
stay where you are .
alright , germans .
help .
they want to kill us .
what is all this?
a greifkommando .
you're kidding .
stop it .
let those men go .
what's this?
you have no authority here .
these men are on the run .
traitors will be killed .
they're old men .
civilians .
you can't do this .
who's going to stop me?
you maybe?
stop it .
that's enough .
dismissed .
this man's a doctor .
can you operate?
not really .
don't let the children take too many toys .
and not too much nightwear .
that's no longer needed .
herr minister ...
frau junge , my family will arrive soon .
can you look after them for a moment?
thank you .
brigade fhrer , what can i do for you?
your volkssturm is an easy prey for the russians .
they have neither combat experience nor good weapons .
their unconditional belief in the final victory makes up for that .
herr minister , without weapons these men can't fight .
their deaths will be pointless .
i don't pity them .
i don't pity them .
the people called this upon themselves .
this may come as a surprise to you .
don't fool yourself .
we didn't force the people .
they gave us a mandate .
and now they're paying for it .
eva , you have to leave the fhrer .
don't be stupid .
this is about life and death .
how can you say that?
where are you?
i decided not to die in berlin .
does my sister know where you are?
think about it .
i'll call you back .
children , your room is to the right .
wait for me .
hello , frau goebbels .
good to see you , frau junge .
line up , children .
helga , come .
line up .
let's make ourselves look good and then we go say hello to uncle hitler .
do you remember the song?
the best thing to do is to shoot yourself in the mouth .
you won't feel a thing .
you'll be dead right away .
i want to be a beautiful corpse .
i'll take poison .
if i have to die , at least without any pain .
that's definitely painless .
it paralyses the nervous system and the respiratory system .
a matter of seconds .
can i have one too?
me too .
himmler provided me well .
thank you .
i would have liked to give you a nicer present .
berlin , 23 april 1945 .
dear sister .
i'm sorry to write you this .
but this is how it is .
it could be over any moment .
hermann isn't with us .
but i'm sure you'll see him again .
he'll get through this and he'll fight from bavaria .
the fhrer lost all hope of a good outcome .
dear son .
i don't know if you'll receive this letter .
maybe someone will allow me to send you a last greeting .
i stayed with daddy against his will .
last sunday , the fhrer wanted to help me escape .
but you know your mother .
we have the same blood .
i won't even think about it .
our ideology's going down the drain ... ... and with it , everything that made life beautiful and worthwhile .
after the fhrer and national socialism , there's nothing left to live for .
that's why i brought the children too .
they're too good for the life that awaits them .
god will have mercy on me if i bring them redemption myself .
i'll wear my bracelet with the green stone until the very end .
after that , i want you to always wear it .
unfortunately , my diamond watch is with the watchmaker .
i included the address below .
i hope you're lucky enough to get it .
i want you to get it .
you'll also get the bracelet with the topaz pendant .
a birthday present from the fhrer .
i owe some money to the heise company .
there may be more debts , but no more than 1500 reichsmarks .
all correspondence with the fhrer must be burnt .
i'm sending you some food and tobacco .
the coffee is also for lindner and kathl .
the cigarettes are for mandi , the tobacco for daddy , the chocolate for mummy .
i can't think of anything else .
that's it for today .
dear sister , i wish you lots of happiness .
and remember , you will see hermann again .
the warmest regards and a kiss from ... ... your sister .
inge .
listen , keitel .
i want you to leave this evening .
go to dnitz and help him with the organisation .
things have to be started up again .
i don't understand you .
we have no more oil fields .
that's catastrophic .
it makes any serious operation impossible .
when everything has been solved here , we must get the oil fields back .
any questions?
no , mein fhrer .
good .
have a good trip .
... do you agree that i take charge ... ... with complete freedom of action?
if i receive no reply by 2200 hours ... ... i'll assume you have been incapacitated .
i will then act on behalf of the country and the motherland .
that's high treason .
and betrayal of you .
gring's concerns are not entirely unjustified .
if our communication system fails ... ... we'll be cut off from the outside world .
we won't be able to issue orders anymore .
i think gring wants to seize the power .
i never trusted his clique on the obersalzberg .
this looks like a coup .
the loser , the sponger .
a parvenu , a lazy bastard .
how dare he say i'm incapacitated?
hello .
how did you get into berlin?
it wasn't easy , but i must speak to the fhrer .
if i were you , i'd wait a bit .
the luftwaffe .
what did he turn that into?
for that alone , he should be executed .
this morphine addict corrupted the country .
and now this .
he's betraying me .
me of all people .
i want gring stripped of his power , right away .
and , in case i don't survive the war ... ... he must be executed immediately .
what's going to happen to us?
is there any hope left?
frau junge , leave from here before it's too late .
the fhrer wants to stay .
we can't leave him behind , can we?
he doesn't need anybody for what awaits him .
and least of all you .
but herr goebbels and his wife stay here .
and the children .
but the children ...
i have always believed ... ... that there was a way out .
come in .
albert .
hello .
you have a fever .
albert , i can't stand it anymore .
why don't you leave with the children , magda?
leave?
and go where?
i can arrange for you to be taken to schwanenwerder by barge .
you can hide until everything's over .
it won't be long now anyway .
i thought about it .
my children cannot grow up in a world without national socialism .
think about it .
the children have a right to a future .
if national socialism dies , there will be no future .
i can't believe you really want that .
go now .
come in .
i knew you'd come .
you wouldn't desert the fhrer .
i've come to say goodbye to the fhrer .
i'm going back to hamburg tonight .
of course , you must go .
sit down .
i took some furniture you designed .
i couldn't leave it behind .
please , you must not have eaten all day .
that's true .
it's very important that you came .
it shows him you're on his side .
did he ever doubt that?
lately , he often thought you were against him too .
i always said you'd come and here you are .
i think he liked it that you advised him to stay in berlin .
i also think it's best .
and , you know ... ... it may sound strange ... ... but i'm really happy here .
and i'm not afraid .
you came .
mein fhrer , i ...
it's good .
let's sit down .
i had great plans for the germans and the world .
nobody understood me .
not even my old brothers in arms .
the opportunities we had .
the whole world was ours to grab .
too late .
i can only be proud for openly fighting the jews ... ... and for cleansing the lebensraum from the jewish poison .
i don't find it hard to continue .
one brief moment ... ... and then eternal peace .
but please spare the people , mein fhrer .
if my people cannot endure this ordeal ... ... i won't shed a tear .
they get what they deserve .
they called this fate upon themselves .
for months ... ... i have to tell you this ... ... for months i have sabotaged your orders for destruction .
i not only ignored your orders , but even acted against them .
i had to tell you .
this never compromised my personal loyalty to you .
so you're leaving .
good .
goodbye .
i wish you all the best .
eat well , gentlemen .
peter .
it's alright , son .
he has a fever .
yes , but he's alive .
loyalty and courage still exist in this world .
ritter von greim and frulein reitsch , how good ... ... that the both of you arrived more or less unharmed .
sit down .
we came under heavy fire , but still arrived in gatow .
from there , we couldn't continue .
we flew in a fieseler storch , over the russian lines ... ... and landed on the east west axis , close to here .

general von greim , i appoint you supreme commander of the luftwaffe .
i hereby promote you to general feldmarschall .
a big responsibility rests on your shoulders .
you have to rebuild the luftwaffe from scratch .
many mistakes have been made .
be ruthless .
life doesn't forgive weakness .

compassion is an eternal sin .
to feel compassion for the weak ... ... is a betrayal of nature .
the strong can only triumph if the weak are exterminated .
being loyal to this law , i've never had compassion .
i've always been ruthless when faced with internal ... ... opposition from other races .
and that's the only way .
apes , for instance , ... ... kill all the odd ones .
and what applies to apes , must definitely apply to humans .
himmler made an offer to surrender ... ... to the allied powers .
via count bernadotte .
a message from english radio .
himmler .
himmler of all people .
the most loyal of my loyals .
that's the worst betrayal .
