man walks into a bar with a giraffe .
they each get pissed .
the giraffe falls over .
the man goes to leave and the barman says " oi !
you can't leave that lying there .
he says " no , it's not a lion .
it's a giraffe " .
he's completely humourless .
you two should get on like a house on fire .
so who are you?
you're from the hospital .
are you a doctor?
he's not a doctor .
he's a patient .
i'm a bicycle courier .
i was riding a package from farringdon to shaftesbury avenue and a car cut across me .
then i wake up today in hospital .
i wake up and i'm ...
i'm hallucinating or i'm ...
what's your name?
jim .
i'm mark .
this is selena .
ok , jim .
i've got some bad news .
it started as rioting , and right from the beginning you knew this was different .
because it was happening in small villages , market towns .
and then it wasn't on the tv any more .
it was in the street outside .
it was coming through your windows .
it was a virus .
an infection .
you didn't need a doctor to tell you that .
it was the blood .
there was something in the blood .
by the time they tried to evacuate the cities , it was already too late .
the infection was everywhere .
the army blockades were overrun .
and that's when the exodus started .
the day before broadcasting stopped , there were reports of lnfection in paris and new york .
we didn't hear anything more after that .
what's the government doing?
there's no government .
of course there's a government !
there's always a government .
they're in a bunker or a plane ...
no , there's no government , no police , no army .
no tv , no radio , no electricity .
you're the first uninfected person we've seen in six days .
where's your family?
they're dead .
like selena's .
yours will be dead too .
look , i have to find them .
they live in deptford .
i can walk it .
ok?
you'll go and come back , yeah?
you won't .
yes !
no one ever comes back .
so lesson one .
you never go anywhere alone unless you've got no choice .
lesson two .
only travel during daylight .
unless you've got no choice .
we'll take you tomorrow .
we'll all go and find your dead parents together , ok?
eat .
lf you want her to slow down , you'll have to say .
lf there's anyone ...
i understand .
anyone ...
i understand !
ok .
jim ...
wait !
they died peacefully .
you should be grateful .
i'm not grateful .
my ... parents and my sister , we went to paddington station , hoping maybe we could get on a plane , maybe we could buy our way onto a plane .
i remember my dad had all this cash , even though cash was completely useless .
about 20, 000 other people had the same idea .
crowd was surging .
i lost my grip on my sister's hand .
i remember the ground was soft .
i looked down and i was standing on all these people .
like a carpet .
people who had fallen and ...
somewhere in the crowd there were lnfected .
it spread fast .
no one could run .
all you could do was climb .
climb over more people .
so i did that .
i climbed .
and i got up on top of this kiosk .
looking down , you couldn't tell which faces were infected and which weren't .
then i saw my dad .
not my mum or my sister .
my dad .
his face ...
selena's right .
you should be grateful .
we don't have time to get back to the shop before dark .
we should stay here tonight .
my room's up at the top .
you two can have that .
no , we'll all sleep in the same room .
it's safer .
jim .
you're back .
yeah .
how was it?
fine .
give me a drink of that , will ya?
it's empty .
ha !
here .
i'll start working on them , then .
mark !
mark !
selena !
help !
it's clear .
that's mr bridges .
were you bitten?
and his daughter .
from four doors down .
were you bitten?
no .
did any of the blood get in your mouth?
no .
mark?
wait ...
get that cleaned off .
do you have any clothes here?
um ...
i ...
yes .
then get them and get dressed .
we have to leave now .
more lnfected will be coming .
they always do .
how did you know?
how did you know he was infected?
the blood .
there was blood on me .
it was on you .
i didn't know he was infected .
he knew .
i could see it in his face .
lf someone gets infected , you've about 20 seconds to kill them .
it might be your brother , your sister or your oldest friend .
it makes no difference .
just so you know where you stand , if it happens to you , i'll do it in a heartbeat .
he was full of plans .
have you got any plans , jim?
do you want us to find a cure and save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?
plans are pointless .
staying alive's as good as it gets .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
what's that?
let's go .
what is it about tower blocks and shopping trolleys?
stop talking .
it's a long way up .
do you need a break?
you?
no .
now i do need a break .
what's up?
nothin '.
i got a headache .
bad?
pretty bad .
why didn't you say something before?
i didn't think you'd give a shit .
you've got no fat on you and all you've had to eat is sugar .
so you're crashing .
there isn't a lot we can do about that except pump you full of painkillers and give you more sugar .
as for sugar ,
pepsi or lilt?
do you have any tango?
actually , i did have a can of tango somewhere .
quiet !
that's an lnfected .
oh no , they're in .
move !
wait up , selena !
wait for me , please !
please , selena !
please !
wait for me !
come on !
run !
wait !
please !
for fuck's sake !
selena !
down the corridor .
flat 157 .
move !
thank you .
thank you .
open the door !
open the door !
open up !
where's dad?
what?
open the fucking door !
where's dad?
let them in , hannah .
let them inside .
go in .
go in !
so , i'm frank , anyway .
jim .
selena .
selena .
good to meet you .
this is my daughter hannah .
come on , sweetheart .
say hello .
come on .
so ...
this is great .
just great .
calls for a celebration , i'd say .
why don't you all sit down and ...
hannah , what have we got to offer?
we've got mum's creme de menthe .
great .
creme de menthe .
oh , yeah .
look , sit , please .
get comfortable .
where are the bloody glasses?
middle cupboard .
nah , the good ones .
it's a celebration .
top cupboard .
so this is your place?
it's nice .
there .
i know it isn't much but , well , cheers .
cheers .
you ok in there , jim?
yeah .
sorry we couldn't spare the water .
same with the toilet .
the flush doesn't work .
you'll have to use the bucket .
have to empty it each morning .
just chuck it over the balcony .
no mod cons here .
it's fine .
listen , it's late .
we're gonna turn in .
we have a spare room .
ln there .
are you and selena ...?
no .
no , no , no .
um ...
i'll take the living room .
it's fine .
right .
no , i mean , yeah .
so , um ...
goodnight , then .
yeah .
goodnight , frank .
very spruce .
very shredded .
yeah .
so what do you make of them?
well , they're desperate .
probably need us more than we need them .
i think they're good people .
good people?
yeah .
you should be more concerned about whether they're gonna slow you down .
because if they slowed you down ...
i'd leave them behind .
ln a heartbeat .
yeah .
i wouldn't .
then you're gonna wind up getting yourself killed .
i'm gonna get some sleep .
selena ...
you think i don't get it , but i do get it .
and i know i'd be dead already if i hadn't met you .
sure .
no , look ...
i mean , thank you .
and i mean , sure .
goodnight , jim .
goodnight .
we lost water pressure three weeks ago .
i thought we'd be ok with the water from the other flats .
cisterns and tanks .
but it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe .
you drink it , it evaporates , turns stagnant .
they're all empty .
hasn't rained in ten days .
you can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation .
saw it on tv once , but i can't make it work .
you'd never think it .
needing rain so badly .
not in fucking england !
jim , we're not going to be able to stay here .
there's been no broadcasts for weeks .
just listen .
salvation is here .
the answer to lnfection is here . if you can hear this , you're not alone .
there are others like you .
there are other survivors .
we are soldiers and we are armed .
oh , my god .
soldiers .
quiet .
there's more .
our location is the 42nd blockade , m602 , 27 miles northeast of manchester .
you must find us .
salvation is ...
now itjust repeats .
it's a recording?
yeah , it's a recording .
but this is where it's telling us to go .
just there .
the way things are , we might need two or three days to get up there .
we "?
sound carries in this flat .
me and hannah do need you more than you need us .
look , i didn't ...
no , it's ok .
it's the truth .
i can't leave the block if it's the two of us .
something might happen to me .
hannah'd be alone .
i couldn't risk it .
but with other people ...
lf it's a recording , the soldiers who made it could be dead .
it's possible .
that stuff about the answer to lnfection ...
there is no answer !
it's already done all the damage it can !
maybe they have a cure .
maybe they've got nothing .
the only way to find out is to reach them .
we could die trying , frank !
or die here .
and anyway , it isn't true what dad said .
you need us just the same as we need you .
we need each other .
and we'll never be safe in the cities .
the soldiers could keep us safe .
so we have to try and get there .
get there how?
just so you know , i don't take cheques or credit cards .
what do you think?
it's the most direct route .
then we should take the indirect route .
the one in daylight and not underground .
let's just get it done .
no , no .
no .
see , this is a really shit idea .
you know why?
because it's obviously a shit idea .
so we're gonna drive into the tunnel full of fucking smashed cars ...
it's really fucking obviously a shit idea !
hold on !
dad !
fuck !
the world's worst place to get a flat .
agreed .
i think we'd better do this quick .
i've got the wheel .
you're on the jack .
do you hear that?
hey , hey , do you hear that?
hear what?
right , i've done it .
dad?
jesus christ !
fucking rats !
they're running from the lnfected .
move it !
forget the jack , hannah .
there's no time .
just lift , everyone .
grab hold !
one , two , three , lift !
lift , lift !
don't look at them !
don't look !
i can see them !
they're coming !
come on , hannah !
almost .
get the tyre on , hannah !
i'm trying .
three , two , one , drop it !
get in the car !
come on !
frank , drive !
move it , frank !
whoo !
goodbye , you fuckers !
frank , stop the cab .
let's shop .
you ...
you ...
you ...
anybody seen any buns?
hmm . lrradiated .
don't take anything that needs to be cooked , ok?
i think you can eat that raw .
decaffeinated coffee ...
put that back .
can'tjust take any crap .
lf i never see another chocolate bar again , it'll be too soon .
not counting terry's chocolate orange !
now , single malt , 16 year old , dark , full flavour .
warm but not aggressive .
peaty aftertaste .
takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth .
either we do this now or we're walking .
not you .
stay close , jim .
what?
you heard .
where are you going?
we've got enough food , jim .
we don't have any cheeseburgers .
like going on holidays with your aunt !
oh , jesus .
hello?
i hate you !
find anything?
find anything , jim?
no !
let's get outta here .
ok , we're done here .
ok , hannah .
easy .
brake !
brake , brake !
out .
mmmm !
oh my god !
i can , like , taste the vitamin c.
mmmm , the raisins are so moist .
what did you say?
the raisins .
they're so moist .
look over here .
like a family .
do you think they're infected?
no .
they're doing just fine .
come on .
let's eat !
know what i was thinking?
that you'll never hear another piece of original music again .
you'll never read a book that hasn't already been written , or see a film that hasn't already been shot .
um .... that's what you were thinking .
no .
i was thinking i was wrong .
about what?
all the death .
all this shit .
it doesn't really mean anything to frank and hannah because ...
well , she's got her dad and he's got his daughter .
so ...
cheeky monkey !
i was wrong when i said staying alive is as good as it gets .
see , that's what i was thinking .
was it?
mm .
you stole my thought .
sorry .
that's ok .
you can keep it .
it's getting late .
we'd better stay here for the night .
i can't sleep .
me neither .
doesn't feel safe , does it?
outside like this .
i think we're safe enough .
selena didn't seem to have any trouble .
yeah , i noticed that .
hey , selena ...
what?
what is it?
how'd you get to sleep?
bloody hell .
must've needed a hell of a prescription for that lot .
i didn't need a prescription .
i qualified as a chemist .
oh , great .
valium .
not only will we be able to get to sleep but if we're attacked in the middle of the night , we won't even care .
two each .
not for me , thanks .
can i , dad?
i don't think so , sweetheart .
please?
no .
i can't sleep .
come on , frank .
let her live a little .
give her half of one .
all right .
we're on .
night night .
you're a big softie , frank .
frank?
hannah?
frank?
hello?
hello !
hello !
hello !
hello !
shh ...
you're having a bad dream , that's all .
thanks , dad .
come on , sleepyhead .
come on , babe ruth .
hurry up .
did i miss breakfast?
you'll sleep through anything .
did you have a fry up?
we'll stop at a pub on the way .
door !
our location is the 42nd blockade , the m602 , 27 miles northeast of manchester .
you must find us .
please !
salvation is here .
the answer to lnfection is here .
must be manchester .
the whole of manchester , the whole city .
no fire crews to put it out .
42nd blockade .
this is it .
i don't understand , dad .
did they leave?
i don't like this .
i think we should go .
no !
vehicles .
we should check the vehicles .
there has to be something .
nothing .
i can't believe it .
frank ...
frank !
we have to go .
yeah .
go fucking where? !
get out of it .
get out of it !
dad , are you all right?
yeah , i'm fine , sweetheart .
sorry i lost my temper .
hannah ...
i love you very much .
what?
keep away from me .
stay where you are .
dad?
keep away from me !
keep away from me !
keep away !
keep away !
keep away !
dad !
keep away !
keep away !
what's wrong?
dad !
jim !
jim , he's infected !
no !
now , jim !
now !
jim , kill him !
jim !
dad !
kill him !
stay away from him !
keep away from the body !
dad?
three survivors .
one male , two female .
i repeat , one male , two female .
eta , 15 .
put the kettle on .
i'm major henry west .
welcome .
jim .
hello , jim .
hello .
well , we've got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water .
so you can all have a shower .
you look like you need one .
please .
it ain't funny .
i got loads of cooking to do , you fucking doris !
run him over !
how is she doing?
she's lost her dad , jim .
that's how she is .
it's all fucked .
what do you mean?
oh , don't do that .
come on , come on , come on .
hey , don't do that .
hannah is what frank says she is .
tough , strong , and she'll cope just like i'll cope .
just like you'll cope .
i don't want her to have to fucking cope .
i want her to be ok .
when hannah had her dad it was ok .
it was ok for them and it was ok for us .
now it's all just fucked .
so you heard our broadcast?
yeah , we did .
we must be a disappointment .
you were hoping for a full brigade .
an army base with helicopters and a field hospital .
we were just hoping for ...
the answer to lnfection .
yeah .
as i said before , it's here .
though it may not be quite what you imagined .
just feel lucky to have found you .
you were lucky .
the fire drove hundreds of lnfected out of manchester .
the surrounding area's teeming with them .
but don't worry .
you're quite safe here .
flat terrain all round the house .
floodlights which we've rigged up to a generator .
high perimeter wall which helps .
and we've been lacing the ground with tripwires and land mines .
you wouldn't want to mow the lawn , but if they get in , we hear them .
secondary to protection , our real job is to rebuild .
start again .
the belly of the house .
the heart .
a wood fired boiler providing us with hot water .
the first step towards civilisation .
the kitchen .
here you are .
i'll swap you .
now don't be throwing it .
here , give us some .
don't be fighting .
will you put that back?
put it back .
jones , our resident tin opener .
what are you cooking , jones?
surprise , sir .
i can't wait .
and lastly , meet mailer .
mailer , jim .
jim , mailer .
got infected two days ago .
mitchell managed to knock him out cold and we got a chain round his neck .
keeping him alive?
the idea was to learn something about lnfection .
have him teach me .
and has he?
ln a way .
he's telling me he'll never bake bread .
farm crops , raise livestock .
he's telling me he's futureless .
and eventually he'll tell me how long the lnfected take to starve to death .
you'll have to wait and see
hope it's chips , it's chips
we hope it's chips , it's chips
hat .
so , what have we here?
tinned ham , tinned peas , tinned beans and ...
nice one , doris !
omelette !
it's a feast , jones .
honour of our guests .
absolutely .
i was going to propose a toast but this omelette will do just as well .
to new friends .
new friends .
jones , did you notice while cooking that these eggs were off?
i thought the salt might cover the taste , sir .
get rid of it .
doris , you twat .
i don't suppose you can cook , can you?
i can't tell you how badly we need someone with a little flair in the kitchen .
what a fucking disappointment .
i saw those eggs , i thought it was christmas .
we'll have eggs again .
once everything's back to normal .
you muppet !
look at him , eh?
he's still waiting for marks and spencer's to reopen .
you don't know nothing .
i think bill's got a point .
lf you look at the whole life of the planet , we ... you know , man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye .
so if the infection wipes us all out , that is a return to normality .
that what you meant , bill?
yeah , yeah .
have you met our new age sergeant?
our spiritual guru .
tell me , farrell , exactly why did you join the army in the first place?
this is what i've seen in the four weeks since lnfection .
people killing people .
which is what i saw in the four weeks before lnfection , the four weeks before that ...
as far back as i care to remember , people killing people .
which to my mind puts us in a state of normality now .
you're not eating?
i don't want to eat .
you must eat , hannah .
i don't want to eat .
i want to bury my dad .
he's one of the people you're talking about .
let's go , let's go , let's go !
move !
move !
move !
move !
enemy in front !
mick , i fucking got one !
what do you want , a fucking sweetie?
keep shooting , you cunt !
fucking hell !
he bounced !
cease fire !
i ain't never seen that in my life !
report clear !
fucking hell !
clear .
clear .
yeah , yeah , clear .
oh , hello !
listen , sweetheart , you ain't gonna be needing this any more .
cos you got me to protect you now .
you wanna get your hands on a really big chopper , you just come and see me .
fuck you !
that's an offer , mitch .
give her some .
how about right now?
mitchell !
easy , tiger .
you don't wanna go picking a fight with me , son .
sergeant farrell !
mitchell , first action on .
resecure the perimeter .
then get to it .
jones , bedford , go with him .
slow down .
sergeant?
sir .
clear the bodies off the lawn .
the rest of you , go with him .
my apologies .
drink?
look , we're grateful , ok?
we're very grateful for your protection but if we're gonna stay here ...
who have you killed?
no one .
who have you killed?
you wouldn't be alive now if you hadn't killed somebody .
i killed ...
i killed a boy .
a child?
yes .
but you had to .
otherwise he'd have killed you .
survival .
i understand .
i promised them women .
what?
eight days ago i found jones with his gun in his mouth .
he said he was going to kill himself because there was no future .
what could i say to him?
we fight off the lnfected or we wait until they starve to death and then what?
what do nine men do except wait to die themselves?
i moved us from the blockade , i set the radio broadcasting and i promised them women .
because women mean a future .
selena !
hannah !
what is it?
we have to go .
jim , wait !
no time !
come on !
come on !
we get in the car and we go !
no !
you're not going to keep them here !
you've got to let them go !
you can't keep them here !
stay where you are !
i'm not gonna let you keep them here !
you can't do this !
right , get him !
i want to give you a chance .
you can be with us .
but i can't let them go .
ok , jim?
ok .
him too .
smithers says " women and semen don't mix .
and mr burns says " we all know what you think , smithers .
and that was my favourite joke in the simpsons .
that's what they're doing a few hundred miles away , across the channel , across the atlantic .
eating dinner and watching the fucking simpsons !
they're sleeping in their beds next to their wives .
but we're here chained to a fucking radiator because the oc has gone insane !
starting the world again when the rest of the world hasn't even stopped .
just imagine , just think about it .
how could lnfection cross the oceans?
how could it cross the mountains and the rivers?
it can be stopped .
right now tvs are playing and planes are flying and the rest of the world is continuing as fucking normal .
think !
actually think about it .
what would you do with a diseased little island?
they quarantined us .
there is no lnfection .
it's just people killing people . " he's insane !
time to go .
quarantine?
please ...
believe me , i'm not interested .
you see , i'm gonna have the black one .
and i'm gonna make her squirm .
mitchell , i swear to god it's gonna end badly for you .
move .
come on , move !
get up !
get up , you cunt !
fucking move !
get up !
move your fucking arse !
come on then , you fucking pansies .
do me first .
no , mitch .
mitch , just use the gat .
so you're gonna stick me?
shoot 'em !
why?
because it's fucking quicker !
ls that how you'd let your sergeant go out , jones?
i'll shoot them !
no , you won't .
you'll let him stick me?
like a fucking dog?
i'm gonna enjoy this .
you stupid cunt !
what are you doing?
you wanna shoot me?
you wanna shoot me?
i'll kill you !
where's he fucking gone?
fuck it !
get up !
get after him !
jones , move it !
i can see him !
i can see him !
where are you?
can you see him?
through there !
oh no .
we're fucked .
we're fucked !
relax .
he's over the wall .
he's got no vehicle .
and no shooter .
he's dead .
the first thing we're going to do is make you look more presentable .
the lady of the house has an extensive wardrobe which she certainly has no use for .
you can't do it to hannah .
