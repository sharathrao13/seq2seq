good luck , chihiro , we'll meet again .
chihiro .
chihiro .
we're almost there .
this really is the middle of nowhere .
i'll have to shop in the next town .
it'll be great , once we get used to it .
look , there's the school .
that's your new school , chihiro .
it doesn't look so bad .
i liked my old school ...
mommy ...
my flowers died !
no wonder , the way you clung to them .
a little water when we get there and they'll perk right up .
my very first bouquet is farewell flowers , how sad ..
what about that rose you got for your birthday?
one rose isn't a bouquet .
you dropped your card .
i'm opening the window .
c'mon now , behave yourself it's a big day for all of us .
splrited away
hey ...
did i take the wrong turn?
i don't get it .
that must be it , look .
it must be that blue one over there .
that's it .
i must've missed the turn off .
i bet this road will get us there .
this is always how you get us lost .
just a little farther , ok?
what are those little houses?
they're shrines , people pray to them .
daddy , are we lost?
we're fine , we've got 4 wheel drive .
sit down , chihiro .
you're going to kill us !
a tunnel?
what's this strange building?
must be the way in .
honey ...
let's go back , honey .
chihiro .
no ...
it's just plaster .
this building's pretty new .
the wind's going in .
what is it?
let's have a look , there's a way through .
it's creepy , daddy , let's go back .
no need to be scared .
just a little farther , ok?
the moving van'll get there before us .
so , let 'em , they've got the keys let the movers move us .
i know , but ...
no !
i won't go !
daddy , let's go back .
nothing to be scared of .
i won't go !
chihiro , you wait in the car .
mommy !
wait .
watch your step .
you'll make me trip , chihiro , clinging like that .
where are we?
say , do you hear that?
it's a train !
maybe we're near the station .
let's go and find out .
what are those houses doing here?
i knew it .
this must be an abandoned theme park .
they built so many in the early '90s ... ... but they all went down with the economy .
this must be one of 'em .
what !
even farther !
let's go back .
daddy .
c'mon !
mommy , that building's moaning .
it's just the wind .
what a lovely spot .
we should've brought our lunch with us .
they were making a river .
hey , you smell that?
see , it smells great .
you're right .
maybe they're still open .
hurry up , chihiro .
wait for me !
this way .
can you believe it , they're all restaurants .
where is everybody?
over there !
hey , hey !
in here , here .
how amazing !
hello , anybody here?
come in , chihiro , it looks delicious .
hello !
oh , don't worry we can pay them when they get back .
you're right that one looks great ...
i wonder what this is called .
delicious !
chihiro , taste it !
i don't want to !
let's go !
they're gonna be mad at us .
don't worry . you've got daddy here .
i've got credit cards and cash .
take some .
chihiro .
it's so tender .
mustard ..
thank you .
mommy !
daddy !
weird ...
there's a train !
you're not allowed here go back !
wha ...?
it's almost night !
leave before it gets dark !
they're lighting the lamps , go !
i'll distract them , get back across the river !
what's his problem?
daddy !
daddy , let's go home .
let's go , daddy !
daddy !
mommy !
mommy !
it's water !
this can't be ...
i'm dreaming , dreaming !
wake up !
wake up !
wake ... up ...
it's just a dream , a dream .
go away , disappear .
disappear .
i can see through !
it's a dream , it's got to be .
don't be afraid , i'm a friend .
no , no , no !
open your mouth and eat this .
unless you eat something from this world , you'll vanish .
no !
don't worry , it won't turn you into a pig .
chew it and swallow .
good girl , you're fine .
see for yourself .
i'm back again ...
you see?
now come .
what about my mom and dad?
they didn't really turn into pigs , did they?
you can't see them now , but you will .
quiet !
it's looking for you .
there's no time , let's run !
i ...
i can't stand !
oh , no !
my legs don't work .
calm , now , take a deep breath .
in the name of the wind and the water within thee ...
unbind her .
get up !
hold your breath while we're on the bridge .
even a tiny breath .. .. will break the spell and the attendants will see you .
i'm scared .
be calm .
welcome , always nice to see you .
welcome , welcome .
i'm back from my task .
welcome back , sir .
a deep breath ...
and hold ...
welcome back !
we missed you !
hang on , we're almost ...
master haku !
where have you ...
wha ...
a human?
run !
what ...
master haku , master haku !
chase after it , a human intruder !
i smell humans !
the stench of humans !
they know you're here .
i'm sorry , i took a breath .
no , chihiro , you did very well .
listen and i'll tell you what to do .
stay here , and they'll find you .
i'll distract them .
in the meantime , you escape .
no , don't go !
stay with me , please .
you have no choice , if you want to survive here .
and save your parents , too .
so they did turn into pigs ...
i wasn't dreaming ...
be still ...
when things quiet down , go out by the back gate .
take the stairs , all the way down .
until you reach the boiler room , where they stoke the fires .
kamaji's there , so look for him .
kamaji?
ask him for work .
even if he rejects you , persist .
if you don't work , yubaba will turn you into an animal .
yubaba?
you'll see .
she's the sorceress who rules our world .
kamaji will turn you away , trick you into you leaving .
but keep on asking him for work .
it'll be hard work , but it will give you a chance .
then even yubaba can't harm you .
ok
master haku , master haku !
i have to go .
remember , chihiro , i'm your friend .
how do you know my name?
i've known you since you were small .
my name is haku .
here i am !
master haku .
yubaba wants you .
i know , it's about my task .
um ...
excuse me .
um ...
um , are you kamaji?
um , haku sent me here .
please let me work here .
darn , all at once ...
get to work , you little runts !
i'm ...
kamaji .
slave to the boilers that heat the baths .
step on it , boys !
um , please let me work here !
i've got all the help i need .
the place is full of soot .
plenty of replacements .
oh , i'm sorry .
please wait .
outta the way !
um ...
what should i do with this?
do i just leave it?
finish what you start !
it's hot !
hey , you runts !
wanna turn back into soot?
and you , watch it .
you can't just take someone's job .
if they don't work , the spell wears off .
got no work for you here .
look elsewhere .
you sootballs got a problem? !
get to work !
to work !
chow time .
what?
you guys at it again?
cut it out .
where's your bowl?
i keep telling you to leave it out .
meal time !
take a break !
a human !
you're in trouble !
they're having a fit about it upstairs .
that's my granddaughter .
granddaughter !?
says she wants to work , but i've got all the help i need .
would you take her to yubaba?
the girl can handle her , i'm sure .
not a chance !
and risk my life !?
take this , then , a roasted newt .
real quality .
if you want to work , you'll have to make a deal with yubaba .
might as well try your luck .
fine !
you there , follow me .
can't you even manage a " yes ma'am , " or " thank you "?
yes ...
yes ma'am .
you sure are slow .
hurry !
yes ma'am .
what do you need shoes for !
or socks !
yes ma'am !
did you even thank kamaji?
he's looking out for you .
thank you very much , sir .
good luck !
yubaba lives way up at the top , in the back .
get over here !
you wanna lose your nose?
we're almost there .
right .
here we are .
wel ...
welcome !
this elevator is not in service , sir , please use another .
he's following us ...
quit gawking .
here we are .
your room is on the right .
lin?
yes !
what's that smell?
it's human .
you reek of human .
is that so?
i smell it , i do ..
smells mighty tasty , too .
you're hiding something .
tell me the truth , now .
this smell?
roasted ...
gimme !
not a chance , it's for the other girls .
i'm begging you , i'll settle for a leg !
anyone going up , pull down on the lever .
not going to knock? !
what a puny little girl .
come closer ...
i said closer .
ouch ...
you're making a racket , keep it down .
um ...
please let me work here .
stop babbling .
you're just a useless weakling .
besides , this is no place for humans .
it's a bath house ,
where 8 million gods can rest their weary bones .
your parents had some nerve !
gobbling our guests 'food like pigs !
just desserts , i'd say .
and you'll never see ... ... your world again either .
you'd make a lovely piglet .
or maybe a lump of coal .
i see you're trembling .
actually , i'm impressed you made it this far .
someone must've helped you .. .. i must thank your friend .
just who was it , my dear?
you can tell me .
please let me work here !
not that again !
i want to work here !
shut up !
why should i hire you?
anyone can see you're a lazy , spoiled , crybaby .
stupid to boot .
i've nothing for you .
forget it .
i've got all the bums i need around here .
or maybe you'd like the worst , nastiest job i've got , until you breathe your very last breath !
stop that !
what's wrong ...
i'll be right there !
that's a good baby , now .
what?
you still here !
get out !
i want to work here !
don't shout !
i'll be right there ...
that's a good baby .
there , there ..
please let me work !
ok , ok , just pipe down .
there , there , now .
your contract .
sign your name .
i'll put you to work .
but one peep out of you about anything , and i'll turn you right into a piglet !
um , i sign my name here?
that's right .
quit dilly dallying and do it .
unbelievable .
that ridiculous oath i took .
to give work to whoever asks .
signed it?
yes .
you're chihiro , huh?
yes .
what an extravagant name .
from now on , you'll be sen.
you got that?
you're sen.
answer me , sen !
yes ...
did you call?
this child's starting work as of now , look after her .
yes .
your name?
what?
chi ...
oh , i'm sen.
follow me , then , sen.
haku ...
um ...
no idle chatter .
call me master haku .
even on yubaba's orders ...
we can't allow humans .
her contract's signed .
what ...?
thank you , everyone .
don't send her to us , can't bear that human stink .
three days of eating our food and her smell will vanish .
if she's still useless then , fry her , boil her , do with her as you will .
back to work !
where's lin?
don't dump her on me !
you wanted help .
that's right , lin's just perfect .
go , sen.
yes , sir .
what a pain .
you're gonna pay for this .
off you go !
c'mon .
so you pulled it off , huh? !
you're so thick , i was worried .
keep your wits , now if you need something , ask me , ok?
what's wrong .
i'm dizzy .
so this is our room .
chow , then bed , you'll be fine .
you wash your own apron !
trousers !
you're so puny .
too big ...
um , lin ...
what?
are there two hakus here?
two? !
of him?
i sure hope not .
still too big .
he's yubaba's henchman , watch out for him .
where the ...
here they are .
what's wrong?
are you ok?
what's all the fuss , lin?
new girl , says she feels faint .
meet me at the bridge .
i'll show you your mother and father .
my shoes ...
thank you .
follow me .
daddy , mommy , it's me !
it's sen.
mommy , daddy !
are they sick or hurt?
no , they ate too much .
sleeping it off .
they don't even remember being human .
daddy , mommy , i promise i'll save you !
don't get too fat , or they'll eat you !
hide these .
i thought they were gone .
you'll need them when you get home .
this was a farewell card ...
chi hi ro .
chihiro ...
that's my name .
yubaba rules others by stealing their names .
you're sen here , but keep your real name a secret .
she almost got mine , i'd nearly turned into sen.
if she steals your name , you'll never find your way home .
i no longer remember mine .
your real name?
but it's strange i remembered yours .
go ahead , eat , you must be hungry .
i don't want to .
i put a spell on it to give you back your strength , eat it .
you've had a hard time , eat some more .
can you find your way back?
yes , haku , thank you .
i'll work very hard .
good .
where were you?
i was worried .
i'm sorry .
outta my way .
that the best you can do?
you and sen get the big tub as of today .
what !
but that's frog work !
orders from the top .
better give it your all .
aren't you ... getting wet?
hurry up , sen !
coming !
i'll leave this open .
on the big tub , lin?
lay off me .
jerks !
they haven't scrubbed this in ages !
this bath is reserved for our filthiest guests .
it's caked with sludge .
lin , sen , first customers are here .
right away ...
shoot .
clearly harassment .
this tub needs an herbal soak .
get a tag from the foreman .
a tag?
an herbal soak tag .
right .
what's a foreman , lin?
something's coming , i wonder what .
some useless scum , under cover of rainfall ...
i can't waste that on you !
why good morning !
feeling refreshed?
for kasuga sama .
one deluxe sulfur soak .
no point in standing there .
back to work !
scrub with your hands .
good morning .
your hands , i say .
but ...
um ...
it has to be an herbal soak .
you sure are dense .
oh ...
a fragrant bath coming up relax and enjoy ...
hello , foreman here .
yes , ma'am ...
thank you so much !
that's not ...
hey , you , wait !
what's the trouble?
why , nothing at all ...
we have an intruder .
is it human?
you figure it out .
haku's out today .
wow , you got a really good one .
this goes to kamaji .
water'll be right up , it's not too busy now .
yank on this for hot water .
you're such a klutz .
look at that color .
that's the dried worm salts .
with water this murky , who's gonna see the sludge?
yank it again when it's full , it'll stop .
go ahead , let go .
i'll get our breakfast .
sure !
ouch !
um ...
the bath's not ready yet .
but , there are so many ...
wha ...
they're for me?
but ...
i don't need this many .
no , just one .
madam !
it's a stink god? !
an extra large stinker at that .
headed straight for the bridge .
please turn back .
please withdraw !
the bath is closed for the night .
please withdraw , please !
peeeee ewy ...
something's fishy .
didn't seem like a stink god , to me ...
well , now that it's here , better go greet it !
just try to get rid of it , as fast as you can .
we're sorry , please retire to your rooms !
so terribly sorry !
please hurry !
lin and sen , yubaba's calling .

i asked kamaji to give us all the water he's got !
he's sending the best herbal soak ever !
thank you .
he's got a thorn stuck in him .
a thorn !?
it's in so deep , it won't come out !
