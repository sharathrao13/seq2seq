you are seeing video ...
check this out . ... taken earlier today , showing los angeles officer , hank rafferty ... ... brutally beating an unidentified black male .
police are withholding his name ... ... but we have obtained this photograph ... ... taken after the beating , his face grotesquely bruised and swollen .
it was a bumblebee .
officer rafferty's vicious beating of a black suspect ... ... has sparked a swift and angry response from the black community .
the police and the district attorney's office are treating this very seriously .
i urge the people of this city ... ... to please be patient and trust us to do our jobs .
clearly , this is an isolated incident .
it was a bee .
get the hell out of here .
mr. montgomery , this is detective mcduff ... ... lieutenant washington and district attorney robert barton .
morning .
good morning .
call me .
i'm serious .
giggler .
all right .
weren't you on tv last night?
oh , snap , that is you .
what's up , man?
what happened to your face?
i was attacked by one of your officers .
what do you think?
i mean , what happened to the swelling and bruises?
oh , that .
that ain't nothing but allergies .
bee stings .
come again?
y'all mind if i have a seat?
cool .
y'all gonna ask a brother questions , don't even offer me a seat .
what's happening?
all right .
while i was being slammed into the car , having billy clubs jammed in my neck ... ... that psychotic storm trooper y'all call a cop ... ... also allowed this big ass bumblebee to nearly sting me to death .
you know what?
i'm not even sure that bee wasn't one of his own .
like some anti africanized attack bee , trained to hate black people .
that's the sort of thing y'all gonna uncover in your investigation ... ... so i ain't tripping .
would you excuse us for a moment?
do your thing , man .
thank you .
we can't put this guy on the stand .
he's unstable .
not to mention that he ...
yo .
who's the planet of the apes looking lady in the dress?
that's my father .
handsome man .
i don't believe this .
i'm calling this off .
this is crazy ...
like it or not , rafferty violated his rights .
people won't look the other way .
we can't go through this again .
drop the prosecution and i guarantee you got a riot on your hands .
earl , do you work?
do you have a steady job?
yes , i work .
i work in security , man .
ah .
until i get back in the academy .
i see .
you know what?
y'all need to investigate them ...
mr. montgomery ... ... all allergies aside , did officer rafferty assault you or not?

all right .
let's get down to business .
superior court is now in session .
please be seated .

case cv 34259 .
honorable marsha gailey presiding .
at this time the bee appeared .
right here .
there it is .
it's coming in .
you can't ...
you can't really see it on the tape , but it's there .
okay .
i'm swatting it with my stick .
there i am , stomping on it , with the heel of my boot .
kept missing it .
it's not a good angle .
are you claiming there was no bumblebee at the time of the incident?
no , i'm not .
there was a bumblebee present , man .
oh , good .
and there were birds chirping .
there were dogs barking .
for all i know there was a chipmunk in the bushes , humping a turtle .
you gotta be careful with them chipmunks .
they'll hump anything .
this is no laughing matter , mr. montgomery .
look , man , i came here for justice .
okay , that man right there?
that man harassed and choked me .
he used excessive violence ... ... way before there was or was not a bumblebee , sir .
i know the score .
it's not the first time i been pulled over for dwb .

white boy back there called me " monkey . " drive !

i been waiting my whole life for shit like this to go down .
if you're gonna shoot me , shoot me .
that's the only way i'm getting out .
they getting away , man !
come on !
go !
earl?
man , this slow ass , damn flintstone car , man .
we might as well be peddling with our damn feet .
what's wrong with this piece of junk?
i don't know .
i was gonna take it for a regular maintenance ... ... but for the past six months i've been in prison !
you should've got more time .
pushing me into cars and putting me in satanic chokeholds .
you were resisting arrest !
i was authorized to use any force ...
we could go back and forth on this all night long , man .
fortunately , there are courts to handle this matter .
according to the courts ... ... you were assaulting and battering me like a hillbilly on his wife .
yo , yo , yo !
oh , shit .
this is how i'm gonna conceal the weapon .
pull over !
pull over !
get the van !
you pull over , buddy !
no , get the van !
drop the gun !
get the van !
drop it !
get the v ...
damn !
if i would've gotten out with a wallet in my hand ... ... i'd have bullets all in my ass !
that's some bullshit , man .
security guard , huh , hank?
that's a shame .
hey , washington , how you doing?
better than you .
you okay , man?
you know how it is , my brother .
just a little shaken up , that's all .
let me see if i got this figured out .
you get out of prison , pissed with your life ... ... you decide to pay your buddy earl a visit .
things got out of hand ... ... shots are fired , police respond just in time to catch hank trying to get ... ... away with you in his car , probably holding you at gunpoint .
am i correct?
amazing .
you are very , very good .
wait a second .
this is crazy .
i wasn't out for revenge .
shut the hell up !
just shut the hell up .
i'm tired of your goddamn lies .
i got a restraining order saying you can't get within 100 feet of this guy .
so i don't really give a damn what you have to say .
all i need from you ... ... is your testimony and his ass goes back to prison .
tomorrow .
nothing would make me happier than to see this man go back to prison .
good .
for the heartache ... ... and the trauma .
one time he took the club and he switched it around ... ... with the handle sticking out and bop , right there .
can you see that little cut , right there?
anyway ...
what happens is it makes me start saying incoherent ...
you know , i'm liable to spurt that out .
just incoherent shit .
bitch !
i apologize .
my doctor said i'm not getting proper oxygen up through here .
they said pump it and breathe .
and it's sort of like that sneaker .
it's a weird exercise .
anyway , nothing would make me happier than to see him go to prison .
wait a second here !
get back , bitch !
shut the hell up , hank , and i mean it !
you ...
the violence .
let me calm myself .
unfortunately , certain details of your story are slightly skewed .
what do you mean , skewed?
hank ... ... did not come back for revenge .
thank you .
he came back to apologize .
what?
you went there to apologize?
the man's talking to you .
yep .
and you were saying?
i was ... ... saying i was sorry .
for what?
beating you .
yeah , my dog .
that's what i'm talking about , man .
hank was right in the middle of this very touching apology ... ... when i discovered that my warehouse was being robbed .
so hank and i , we banded together to apprehend these outlaws .
and we would've had them , had not your boys come along .
excuse me?
deputy droop a long .
man , they stopped the wrong car .
you better watch your mouth .
what you gonna do?
beat the hell out of me?
probably blame it on a damn spider .
what you got?
the updated report .
we got a 4 59 at the warehouse , but nothing on a van .
coroner has two bodies .
da says self defense .
so we kick them loose .
the c and l warehouse on 18th?
yeah .
not a cop anymore , hank , so stop acting like one .
i'm all too happy to find any reason to lock your ass up .
you understand?
go find mcduff , tell him i want to see him right away .
yeah , we also encountered a naked girl upstairs , handcuffed to a light fixture .
lola .
do you think you could hook a brother up with another restraining order?
right there , because i recognize them .
great .
all my stuff should be in here too .
what's up?
right .
i don't believe this .
where's my bullets?
we don't return live ammunition .
well , if you're gonna keep the bullets , just keep the gun .
all right .
give me my gun , man .
where's my car?
impound lot .
twenty blocks up , seven blocks over .
you expect that man to walk ...
y'all got a shuttle bus?
you know what?
you upset my partner .
i should set it off up in this ...
but you got your boys .
hank , you believe his attitude , man?
man , they probably gonna give you your car back with no tires .
i like the way you played it back there .
yeah , not letting them in on our case .
that was smooth .
this is our bust , right?
get the hell away from me !
hey , hank !
you know what?
sooner or later , your hostility is officially gonna start affecting our work .
now , look , man .
all you got to do is kind of ...
what is you running for?
i'm trying to talk to you .
look !
i am trying to remain calm ... ... because if i hit you , i will never see the light of day .
which right now seems almost worth it .
so don't push it !
you threatening me?
yeah !
yeah , i'm threatening you !
well , bring it on .
bring it on , hank .
i could have went pro .
i drop bombs on them , drop bombs on them .
what?
here , slip , move , slide , duck .
can't redial without a signal .
oh , bang them out of there .
hey , where you going , man?
shut up !
big red truck and trailer .
truck and trailer .
yeah , look , you guys got a call ... ... yesterday , i think , regarding a white van that you rented out .
we only rent big rigs .
yeah , well , maybe you can help out .
i'm trying to find a couple of my buddies .
i think they rented a truck from you yesterday .
what name is it under?
no , i don't know their names .
listen , pal , we get a lot of people here .
no ...
you listen .
give me the phone .
where are you located?
downtown , on normandie .
south central?
these were white folks .
they just left .
they bought extra insurance for baja .
heading to mexico?
i guess .
thank you .
you're welcome .
the way i see it , they got a 20 minute head start .
they're probably heading down the 405 .
what are you doing?
stop the car !
national security !
stop the damn car !
national security , i'm commandeering this vehicle .
what did i do?
oh , student driver , huh?
man with gun , get your ass up out the car .
go !
okay , okay , don't shoot .
and do your homework !
what the problem is?
hey , man , do i got to solve this crime by myself?
unbelievable .
big , red truck .
it's gonna be easy to find .
it's probably gonna say " big red " all along the side of the truck ... ... in big , red letters .
hey , hank , you know that file back at washington's office?
well , i used my acute peripheral vision to get a upside down read .
wanna know what i saw?
what?
on one of them papers it said , " cla heist .
and?
that's all i saw , " cla .
that's it?
hey , look , man , i said i got peripheral vision , not x ray vision , man .
all right?
now , apparently , we are caught up in some real live ... ... complex ass , espionage shit .
this is great , man , isn't it?
me and you , man , we're security guards out here acting like real cops .
i was a real cop , earl .
well , you must've loved it , huh?
i can't believe you gave that up .

hey , do you know how to hot wire a car?
oh , because i'm black , i automatically know how to hot wire a car?
do you know how or don't you?
yeah .
but not because i'm black .
do it then .
move your leg , man .
close your legs .
get in there .
see that?
all right , go , go , go .

what the hell is that?
this is a beer keg .
it doesn't make any sense .
it makes sense when you put together the pieces .
what pieces?
it's obvious .
the cla , they're smuggling alcohol ... ... into the inner city in an effort to further subjugate the black man .
hey , do you actually believe the crap that comes out of your mouth?
oh , i'm never really sure until i'm finished talking .
think they all kegs?
yeah .
nash .
we got a problem .
well , what we have here appears to be ... ... your average , garden variety , $22 deposit beer keg ... ... but it's way too light .
it must be light beer .
yeah , way too light .
couldn't be a pound and a half .
let's take a peek inside , huh?
yeah , she's empty all right .
you think there's a double wall?
something stashed in between?
happy to take a look .
put on the glasses , boys , or you will go blind .
this torch burns at 4000 degrees fahrenheit ... ... so let's slice open this can of peaches .
incredible .
she's cold as ice .
gorgeous .
why don't you and the keg get a room?
gentlemen , what we have here ... ... is an area 51 , high tech , aerospace alloy .
it weighs next to nothing , disperses heat instantaneously ... ... and is resistant to almost any force in man or nature .
well , is it worth anything?
yeah , millions !
which is exactly why ... ... i want you two to take this thing and get the hell out of my shop .
personally , i don't feel like dying right now ... ... and this is exactly the kind of shit people get killed over .
thanks .
we'll stash the van here until we find out what's what .
whose garage is this?
this guy i know .
it doesn't matter .
no , no .
this ain't no guy garage .
there ain't a power tool in here .
let's go .
hank , this box up here got your name on it .
this wouldn't be your girlfriend's house?
could you do me a favor?
could you stay out of my business?
oh , well , lookie , lookie , lookie .
looks like somebody got dissed , huh?
all right , let me guess , hank .
your girl left because you beat the shit out of her .
no .
ironically , she left me ... ... because i was convicted of beating the shit out of somebody else .
oh , me?
man , go ahead with that , man .
look , hank , i'm just saying , man ... ... i suppose that's what your attitude is all about?
huh?
hanky ain't getting no loving .
i'll be happy to go back in there ... ... and straighten this whole mess out .
no , thanks , you've done enough .
no , serious , hank .
i wanna do it , man .
earl montgomery is a love maker , not a love taker .
wait a second .
let me get this straight .
you're telling me you'd go in there and tell denise ... ... i never harassed you , and i went to jail for no reason?
absolutely .
but you and i both know you got exactly what you deserve .
denise .
i hope they don't think we're breaking in .
she's not home .
damn .
denise got one fine looking maid .
excuse me?
earl ... ... that is denise .
hey .
what do you want , hank?
i only wanna talk .
oh , you wanna talk?
yeah .
or you wanna lie?
because there's a difference , you know .
i've always been honest with you .
of course .
you just forgot to tell me you were beating up black men on your lunch .
oh , snap .
she's witty .
yeah .
she most definitely got the upper hand .
hey , could you be quiet for a minute?
thanks .
look , i told you how ...
yeah , i know , the bumblebee did it .
yeah .
you lied to me , henry .
lies , lies .
lies just compound lies .
you know?
but you saying the same thing .
do your thing .
i didn't beat anybody , okay?
and i can prove it .
this is the man that i was accused of assaulting .
okay , earl .
hi .
you got something you wanna say?
oh , yeah .
she's black .
you never told me she was black .
did i or did i not assault you?
oh , he beat the hell out of me , ma'am .
what?
i'm not gonna lie to the sister .
no , you're ...
you son of a bitch !
i'm not gonna take this !
hey !
get your hands off him .
stop it .
get out .
get out !
get out !
just get out !
henry , get out !
you too .
get out !
get !
but ...
get !
i think the violence might kick off out there .
get out .
listen , man .
wait .
why you all salty at me , man?
look , hank , kill that noise , man .
listen , it's not my fault .
okay?
you told me she was white .
i did not .
well , you didn't tell me she was black .
what difference does it make?
a big difference .
look , if i had lied and told her that you didn't beat me up ... ... i'd be condoning interracial relationships .
which is something i do not condone .
okay , that's it .
if you're not out of my face in three seconds ...
now , you don't wanna be threatening your partner .
i am not your partner !
i had a partner !
i would have taken a bullet for him !
you , i'm having a hard time not shooting !
all right , hold on !
now , that's it .
now i'm upset .
if you leave , i'm gonna put your ass under citizen's arrest .
okay?
and you and i both know you are in direct violation ... ... of a legal , binding restraining order .
you have something in your teeth .
where?
here , or here?
now you can tell people i hit you .
hi .
hi , '78 plymouth volare , tan .
can i have your driver's license?
yep .
are you kidding me?
i got something in my teeth?
i'll tell you what it was , hank .
trust .
and now it's gone .
earl , what do i have to do?
i just came to get earl jr .
i don't go nowhere without my baby .
so why don't you get your jalopy , and we go our separate ways .
that's my car right over there .
could i have the keys?
we're just trying to locate your paperwork , sir .
lookie , lookie , lookie .
what do we have here?
how you doing , miss dolly?
fine .
oh , yes , you are .
you got a pair of handcuffs i can borrow?
you hitting on her?
yeah .
what was all that crap about interracial couples?
i am firmly and belligerently against any interracial coupling ... ... when the man is white .
darling ... ... can i interest you in a stick of gum?
you know , they say five out of five dentists recommend this shit .
thanks .
get your stuff out of my car and get the hell out of here !
miss darling , what do i have to do to get my car out of here? !

hank , freeze !

oh , i'm going straight to heaven .
fence !
chill , hank .
i'm blessed .
what'd you do this time , hank?
i don't know .
i'll find out .
for a cop , you sure get in a hell of a lot of trouble .
yeah , yeah .
turn here .
turn , turn , turn !
hey , chopper .
turn here , turn here !
turn !
always loved the car wash , man .
white , foamy water over you .
brushes waving in the breeze .
when you a kid in the ghetto , that's like going to hawaii .
they got an apb out on both of us .
both of us?
what the hell did i do?
we're wanted for the shootout on the vincent thomas bridge .
yeah , well , that's fair .
no , it doesn't make any sense .
how'd the cops know we were on the bridge?
only the guys in the truck could id us , and they wouldn't call it in .
maybe someone on the inside put out a apb to locate us .
now we're talking about dirty cops .
what you doing?
running the numbers on the van .
no , plates are phony .
damn it !
check the vln .
what?
i thought they were all scratched off .
not underneath .
i pulled it when i was wiring the van .
all units , 5 0 3 , stolen police vehicle .
bingo .
address .
okay .
car wash at venice and crenshaw .
they tracked us .
let's ditch the car !
we need a car .
yeah , yeah .
hey , hey !
hey , hey !
hey , could you pull over here?
god !
use the badge .
what?
use the badge .
stop !
national security !
i'm commandeering this car !
let's see the badge .
just step out of the car , ma'am .
don't you raise your voice at me .
get out of the damn car !
didn't your mama teach you any manners?
at least you could ask me nicely .
you call this commandeering a car?
you wanna shut the hell up?
don't be using that language in my car .
sorry .
now , i got no problem giving you boys a ride .
but i don't take kindly to being told to get out of my car .
no , sir .
i surely do not .
warrant .
a warrant .
they must've had a warrant to raid the warehouse .
the dirty cop had to have access to it to send his boys in first .
same thing must've happened at the storage place .
so who's the leak?
i don't know .
apb's go through watch commander .
washington?
ain't that how it always is?
what?
you have nothing to go on ... ... and already you blaming the black man .
i'm just throwing names out .
i'll tell you how to find a dirty cop .
pick up the phone and call the police station .
don't really matter who answers .
what you gonna say?
thanks .
thank you .
okay , you boys behave now .
no question .
take care .
should i have gotten her number?
definitely .
she's very nice .
i thought so too .
is this the place?
stay cool .
can you pick this?
what?
just because i'm a black man ...
what?
you were doing good .
all black people don't do that .
look , man .
just let it flow ...
can you pick the lock or not?
not without my tools .
hey , hey .
come on .
this is great .
a real stakeout .
my whole life , man , i wanted to be a cop .
ever since i was a kid , watching quincy on tv .
quincy was a medical examiner .
oh .
i guess in the projects we didn't get real good reception .
hey , man .
this is boring .
how long we been here?
coming up on 12 minutes .
where the hell are these people?
earl , this is a stakeout .
we could be sitting here for hours .
no wonder cops are so fat .
shoot .
hey , whatever happened to charlie?
if you don't mind , i'd just ...
i'd rather not talk about it .
you sure?
yeah .
you know , they shot him right in front of me , man .
i couldn't do a damn thing about it .
i'm sorry to hear that , man .
who did it?
the guys we're looking for .
so that's why this is personal .
let me get this straight .
your partner got killed ... ... you lost your job , you got thrown in jail , your girlfriend walked ... ... and now you're a security guard making 182 dollars a week?
know what you are , hank?
you're a black man .
now , though , you gotta think about it though , right?
glad to see you laugh , man .
now how long have we been here?
oh , come on .
coming up on 13 minutes .

hank .
i thought i told you .

i been shot !
you shot him now?
no .
what happened?
you gotta trust us .
we didn't do anything wrong or illegal .
then take him to a hospital .
no , no !
we can't , 'cause the cops are looking for us .
what?
it's complicated !
look , denise , i understand you're a nurse .
i'm bleeding out here .

yeah , go .
hey .

i'll get you a towel .

it's not that big .
it ain't small .
thank you , denise .
that was very sweet of you .
all right , i'm gonna need you to keep pressure on the wound .
right .
okay , bend over the chair and hike up the towel .
what?
i'm not like that , man !

oh , oh .
well , just say that , hank .
i thought you was trying to get a free ass shot .
come on , denise .
now , tell me the truth .
earl , there's no bullet in you .
it went through the bone , out the other side?
it barely touched you .
it's a scratch .
denise , am i gonna need stitches?
yes .
i knew it .
well , just ...
oh !
whoa .
you know what?
what?
i'll let it heal naturally .
oh ...
yeah , yeah , that's right .
oh , no !
it's a bee ...

a bumblebee !
no !
don't move .
don't move !
death from above !
no !
swish it out .
death from above , man .
is it safe?
not for you it ain't !
i can't believe your girl can go off like that .
she hits harder than you do .
yeah , this is it .
marina yacht club .
this is where the call came from .
how we gonna get in?

you got five minutes .
it better be good .
can i get a chip?
no .
you've got a leak and we know who it is .
now can i get a chip?
no .
it's mcduff .
i assume you have some proof .
yeah .
we tracked them knuckleheads who hit my warehouse .
the same guys who killed charlie .
led us right to mcduff .
that's all very interesting , but do you have actual evidence?
no .
no .
but we got what he wants .
and what's that?
the goods from the cla heist .
you got the cla goods?
wait a minute .
it was really cla?
crupps international aerospace .
what cla did you think i was talking about?
would you tell him , please?
a year ago , over $7 million in atomic alloy was stolen out of crupps .
to smuggle it out , they had to melt it down and recast it as beer kegs .
feds tipped us off .
our leak beat us to the punch .
that's right .
mcduff .
offer to sell him back his stuff .
oh , he'll bite .
lf he's dirty .
oh , he's dirty .
now , give the man a chip .
i appreciate you trying to get me a chip .
but thinking that i was talking about the actual cla ...
yeah .
i don't know what i was thinking .
hey , mcduff .
it's your buddies , hank and earl .
what's up , duff?
we got something you want .
i don't know what you're talking about .
we're talking beer kegs , bitch !
you two are wanted felons .
frank , save it .
we know you're dirty .
listen to me ...
no , you listen to me .
i don't know who you're selling these things to .
all we want is a piece of the pie .
say , $1 million worth .
we're talking six zeros , chump .
so , what's your plan?
meet us tomorrow morning , 7 a . m .
the old fort , luna point .
how'd you find this place?
i did a couple nights of security watching some construction equipment .
it's perfect for us , though .
how many boys washington got?
i don't know .
i see five or so .
i'm starting to feel all tingly .
yeah .
i thought i shot you once already .
you're a tough little monkey , aren't you?
you into monkey jokes?
didn't your mama teach you manners when you were humping her?
you bring the metal , hank?
you bring the money , frank?
we'll see about that when i see the kegs .
let's just forget about the money .
we already got what we came for .
i don't think you'll find them as helpful as you thought they'd be .
you see , my men aren't actually members of the l. a. swat team .
where's washington?
i don't know .
excellent question .
shit .
oh , man .

yeah , i do it all the time .

for my partner's peace of mind ... ... would you tell us the numbers on your plate?
sure , 2cqn654 .

yeah .
allow me to assist you ... ... instead of beat you senseless , like some cops would .
thank you , officer you're welcome .
have a good day , all right?
i will .
thanks .
not everyone's a criminal .
remember that .
my car !
no , wait !
that's my car !
always good to have a backup plan .
hey !
