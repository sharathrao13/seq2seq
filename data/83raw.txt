a fire claiming three lives in the south bay yesterday ... ... is believed to have been deliberately set .
the south bay is plagued by a series of fires , all of a similar nature .
authorities believe arson's involved .
they have no suspects yet .
jazz composer edward barla was privately eulogized today .
he was known for tunes " midnight hearts " and " just for you .
edward barla , dead at 56 .
the trial of lou janero has ended .
samantha walker has the story .
the jury has found ... ... lou janero guilty of murdering paul cirela .
cirela , part of janero 's organization , was testifying against janero ... ... in an upcoming trial for bookmaking and tax evasion .
assistant d. a. , thomas mcsherry , credited inspector harry callahan ... ... for his part in the successful prosecution of lou janero .
great credit should go to inspector callahan .
he put janero out of business .
the inspector's evidence not only implicated janero in the murder ... ... but provided the means to file more charges against janero ... ... for bookmaking and gambling .
samantha walker , channel 8 .
back to you .
get off my ass .
he's going .
did you recognize any of the attackers?
is this attack connected to the janero trial?
has janero put out a contract on your life?
were these janero's men?
have you received death threats?
is the department protecting you?
the department will issue a statement ... ... as soon as we've conducted an investigation . $13, 453 . 63 .
that's the price of an unmarked squad .
it's the third car you trashed this month .
lou janero .
what?
his men shot the car .
send him the bill .
see how funny it is behind a desk , because you're off the street .
all this for a car?
lieutenant ackerman's request .
it's for your own good .
if you think i'm gonna  just until we handle janero .
he's in prison , but clearly calling the shots .
literally .
our hero can't be turned to swiss cheese before the commendation .
see?
you're getting a commendation .
swell .
we must take advantage of the press you're getting .
how do you propose to do that?
it's my opinion that you should work with me in public relations .
opinions are like assholes .
everybody has one .
you don't know what you've done for our image .
you just put a major crime figure in prison .
you've got a high visibility right now , and for once , it's positive .
you know what that means for recruitment?
look at this copy we're getting .
we've never been this swamped for interviews .
i'm not some dog and pony act .
we must maximize your public relations value while we can .
getting close and personal with reporters isn't my job .
your job is promoting our positive image .
how positive would it be if i resigned , lieutenant?
don't misunderstand me .
harry , all i'm asking for is a little cooperation .
we don't have to pull you off the street completely .
just be cooperative with the press .
anything else?
yeah .
quan , will you come in here?
quan's moving from the youth gang task force to homicide .
good , homicide can use a cop with al's experience .
i'm glad you agree .
if you remain on the street , quan will watch your back .
now hold on  that's final .
that's swell , being that most of my partners end up hurt or dead .
ask al how he feels about it .
well , quan?
any objections to working with callahan?
i think i can handle it .
get a bulletproof vest , kid .
teaming harry with a chinese american is good for our image .
you have any kids?
me?
no .
lucky for them .
cut .
cut !
you're out of sync , johnny .
what's the problem?
where is that fool?
jeff !
jeff !
we've had a short , peter .
trust me , " you said .
right?
did he say that?
that means " fuck you " in this business .
i checked it .
i've got a backup head .
give me 20 minutes .
all right , do it .
and no cock ups .
and that goes for the rest of you morons .
this sucks , man .
how can i sing with shit exploding all over?
it was an accident .
this whole movie's an accident .
how did i get talked into this shit?
you need a video .
i need this scene for the film .
we're getting what we want .
why aren't we shooting on a warm sound stage , instead of a meat locker?
it's cold so the audience can see your breath when you sing .
brilliant .
not original , but people will know i froze my ass off .
what's that mean?
a director with talent would shoot something original .
instead of ripping off the exorcist .
this is not a rip off , it's a homage .
you stupid ....
jesus , i don't believe you .
what?
you're hurting , aren't you?
what do you mean?
you promised not during shooting .
i know what i'm doing .
i can handle it .
you won't fuck up my film !
i'll handle it !
just let me go back to the trailer and get it together .
then we'll kick some ass .
okay?
okay .
can i get a coat?
get a coat , please , for johnny .
now what?
don't worry , he's a trained seal .
throw him a fish , he'll perform .
rise and shine , boys .
time to get up .
what's happening?
i always knew working homicide would be glamorous .
i mean , meeting celebrities and all .
too bad you can't get his autograph .
you know , harry , they always die in threes .
when a celebrity dies , two more go in a week or two .
it's a fact , harry .
celebrities die in threes .
this one has crystalline around his nose and mouth .
scabs up and down both arms .
fresh puncture marks on his left forearm .
yeah , homicide can be really glamorous .
check the dummy out , please .
meagan .
i want a three inch lens , very tight .
try not to drop it .
let's hurry up and shoot this and wrap this up .
my second assistant and i found johnny in his trailer .
he was just lying there .
at first we thought it was a joke .
but then ....
when did you last see him alive?
a half hour before that .
he went to his trailer while we set up .
was he alone?
i don't know .
he was alone when we found him .
tell me , does anyone on your set use drugs?
we don't do drugs , callahan .
we do film .
what people do is their own business .
if it doesn't interfere with my film , i don't give a shit .
was squares using?
how should i know?
he had agents , lawyers , friends .
it's their job to deal with his drug problem , not me .
well , that's a very caring attitude .
what do you want , callahan?
drugs were his trademark .
his career was singing about them .
it made him controversial .
i can see why you'd want him in your flick .
it was a marketing decision .
johnny sells tickets .
you know , bums on seats , love .
and we needed a video tie in .
any idea who was supplying him?
no , but if i hear of anything , i'll call you first .
marvelous .
check on anyone who dealt with squares .
whether the cast , crew  inspector callahan .
inspector .
shit .
is it true that johnny squares od'd?
we're conducting an investigation .
right as we speak .
nothing's been
thank you , inspector .
excuse me , are you suzanne dayton?
what's going on?
johnny?
johnny?
hold it .
i'm sorry , step back .
no , johnny !
there's nothing they can do .
you'll make yourself sick .
hold on , could we give her a little air?
out of the way , please .
off with that camera .
i'll film what i want .
keep shooting .
this is someone's heartache .
right in here .
what are you doing?
give me that .
smart .
high and dry is the kind of mindless film comedy ... ... that's come to typify summer films aimed at the youth market .
the humor is of the locker room variety .
audiences seeking more sophistication need to look elsewhere .
the producers
rock star johnny squares died this afternoon .
samantha walker filed this report .
johnny squares was found dead at the royal meat company ... ... on location of the film hotel satan .
the cause of death isn't known , but squares had a history of drug use .
he was arrested last july for possession of heroin .
his songs were allegedly based on his drug experience .
what's that all about?
my past catching up with me .
as a kid , i was in the gang that hit him up for money .
all my life , i've been involved with gangs in one way .
i figured i'd come over to homicide for something different .
it's different , all right .
call for backup .
get the fuck out of here .
hurry up !
move it !
put your money on the table !
hurry up !
don't move !
don't fuck with me , lady !
come on , guys , hurry up !
you forgot your fortune cookie .
what !?
you're shit out of luck .
get out of the way !
teaming up with a chinese american is good for the department's image .
who was he?
some guy in the wrong place at the wrong time .
dean madison was his name .
does it ring a bell?
never heard of him .
well , he knew you , harry .
i found this in his pocket .
it's a list of celebrities .
tony engelhart , linebacker .
michael cipriano , race car driver .
and one inspector harry callahan .
johnny squares is on that list .
see what's by his name?
yeah , r. i. p. " rest in peace .
you know what this is?
it's a bill for a tv camera and lens .
i said stop wrecking cars , not destroy something else .
they interfered with an investigation .
don't give us that .
is this your media cooperation?
cooperation works two ways .
what is it you have against reporters?
some of them are just marvelous people .
some walk through a pile and track it through an investigation .
you better change your attitude .
unless we reach an agreement with them ... ... it'll cost this city 2 million , and your career .
join us , please .
ms. samantha walker of station kwsf .
captain donnelly .
ms. walker .
captain .
and this is inspector  callahan .
we've met .
yes , of course .
won't you sit down?
ms. walker ... ... lieutenant ackerman tells me you have a proposal to make ... ... regarding the accidental damage to
there was nothing accidental about it .
the department has something to say about it .
although the camera was destroyed , i have the entire incident on video .
i see .
and your proposal?
we'll be willing to drop the lawsuit against the city ... ... but that depends on inspector callahan .
the inspector would be willing to  what do you have in mind?
dinner .
i owe you an apology .
you were right the other day .
i had no business intruding on that girl's grief .
i get too eager sometimes .
in my rush to get the story , i made an error .
we all make those sometimes .
no , i should have known better .
i'm sorry .
let me ask you , miss walker  sam .
sam .
do you like cops?
as long as their not in my rear view mirror .
why?
what are we talking about , other than the damaged camera .
oh , no , no , no .
i'm letting the insurance company deal with that .
and i think i can be persuaded to drop the lawsuit ...
... but i want something in return .
oh?
what would that be?
i want your story .
what's that?
i've done my homework on you .
you've had quite a colorful career .
look at this .
you see ... ... there's a lot of interest in the janero case ... ... and the cop who put him in prison .
channel 8 is doing a special on organized crime in the bay area .
but what i'd like to do is an in depth profile ...
... of you , inspector harry callahan .
sorry , i'm not interested .
why not?
this latest attempt on your life by one of janero's men
you're not interested in doing a story on me .
you want blood .
that's what sells
now wait a minute  no , you wait a minute .
you people are interested in death and mayhem ... ... and you don't care how you get the story .
that is not fair .
that's not the kind of journalism i do .
to you i'm just a cop with a price on his head .
i don't like people saying they'll kill me .
or journalists using it as a way to increase ratings .
what i was asking  that's the end of the story .
sorry .
the coroner's report last night said that squares used speedballs .
cocaine and heroin?
that's not what killed him .
he used an inhaler with a new designer drug .
a synthetic form of heroin .
you mean something along the lines of china white .
only a thousand times more powerful .
he went into immediate respiratory failure .
what i'm trying to figure is why's a guy like that ... ... using synthetic junk when he's got the real stuff?
maybe he didn't know what he was using .
harry .
harry?
sorry about that .
get you next time .
check the cast and crew for prior drug busts .
i'll see if narcotics has dealers moving synthetic heroin .
harry , there's something you should see .
a story to be published in today's tribune ... ... reveals that director peter swan and people involved ... ... in hotel satan were playing the game called " the dead pool .
sources say the object of the game ... ... was to pick eight bay area celebrities ... ... who'll die by a predetermined date .
the winner was to possess the list with the most dead celebrities .
what makes this story significant ... ... is that rock star johnny squares was on director swan's list .
although swan would not comment ... ... we have confirmed that there was such a game ... ... and swan's production accountant , dean madison , was also involved .
ironically , madison died yesterday ... ... in a tragic holdup that took place in chinatown .
no man is master of the breath of life so as to retain it ... ... and none has mastery over the day of death .
for the lord of all shows no partiality ... ... nor does he fear greatness ... ... because he made the great as well as the small .
and he provides for all alike .
and the dust returns to the earth , as it once was .
and the life breath returns to god , who gaveth .
my condolences .
mrs. dayton , i'm terribly sorry .
suzanne , i'm very sorry .
thank you .
my sympathies .
do you mind , gentlemen?
i happen to be at a funeral .
i'd like to talk about your list .
it's no big secret .
the cast and crew knew about it .
the dead pool is just a harmless game .
it sounds pretty sick to me .
let me tell you something .
people are fascinated with death and violence .
that's why my films make money .
they're an escape , a vicarious release of fear .
same thing with this game .
nobody takes my films or the dead pool seriously .
someone gave squares the drugs that killed him .
maybe you .
you can't tie me to johnny's death because of a coincidence .
my assistant and effects supervisor played too .
why not talk to them?
we will .
but nobody on their list is dead yet .
johnny was a drug user and i predicted he'd die this year .
that's all .
the idea is to pick celebrities who won't make it ... ... because they're old , sick or in a high risk profession .
like police work?
nothing personal .
i don't like being on your list , swan .
that's what this is really about , isn't it?
if you have a choice
maybe i'll start my own pool and put you on it .
are you threatening me?
if you want to play the game , you'd better know the rules , love .
that's our report .
i'm patrick snow .
i'm samantha walker .
thank you for being with us .
tune in tonight for a report ... ... on chemical dependency among celebrities .
who they are , why they do it ... ... and the price they pay .
tonight at 11 .
good night .
and we're clear .
thought i'd seen the last of you .
i saw your report yesterday .
we confirmed it with people in the game .
vicky owens , swan's assistant , and effects supervisor , jeff howser .
it didn't occur to you to clear it with us first?
i had to go with the story .
the papers got the same tip .
i had to get the story out fast .
or someone else would get it first?
something like that .
how were you tipped?
by mail .
a copy of the dead pool and a letter explaining it .
it's already started .
what has?
all the media bullshit .
newspapers print the dead pool and it hurts our investigation .
what bothers you ... ... is that we found out about the dead pool first .
you people take janero and the dead pool , add hype and distortion ... ... and innocent people get hurt .
aren't you overreacting?
i've seen it happen .
i don't like the hype , either ... ... but it happens when reporters compete for a story .
why don't you start thinking about your responsibility to the public?
you can't kill the messenger because of the message .
i'm sorry , it wasn't my intention to screw up your investigation .
here's the list .
now , excuse me .
thanks .
it seems i owe you one .
dinner , that is .
i was offered a job as an anchor at this small local station .
because ... ... i was first runner up in miss colorado .
colorado?
we're right over here .
but i had absolutely no experience , just my bachelor's in journalism .
but it was a way in , so i grabbed it .
but i didn't just smile at the camera and read copy .
i did anything and everything at this station .
sports , news , hard news , weather .
i produced documentaries .
i love san francisco .
but it isn't easy .
big city , big news .
i had to prove myself all over again .
have you succeeded?
somewhat .
apparently not with you .
i shouldn't complain .
at least you stayed for dinner this time .
i'd still love to do your story .
no , thanks .
you're wrong about me , callahan , and what i want to do .
i wish i could convince you .
i'll tell you what .
let's think on it .
sounds fair .
thank you .
it's the truth , i don't care what you say .
hey , callahan .
you're callahan , aren't you?
that's right .
what can i do for you?
you're the cop who put janero away .
all i want is your autograph .
can i shake your hand?
i'd just like to thank you .
it's about time somebody did something about janero .
could you sign it to chester docksteder?
that's me .
let me buy you a drink .
some other time .
we need more cops like you .
that's what we need .
i gotta change my shorts .
what are you laughing at?
this is your 15 minutes , callahan .
andy warhol said everybody's famous for 15 minutes .
well , this is it .
swell .
was it your first autograph?
yeah .
and i hope my last .
you know something?
i don't think lou janero likes you very much .
she's okay .
just a little shaken up .
how're you doing , girl?
whatever they're paying you , harry , it couldn't be enough .
my colleagues .
i don't want to be the news .
let's get you out of here .
you sure you want to see this guy?
yeah .
here's your animal .
hicks .
what the fuck do you want?
i brought you some cigarettes .
and what would i have to do for you?
nothing .
just stand where i tell you .
stay right here .
fifth cell down .
that's the trouble with this prison .
they let anybody in .
i don't like scum like you trying to kill me .
sounds to me like this dead pool thing is making you a little paranoid .
oh , yeah .
i heard about it .
good news travels fast .
big fucking media hero .
hero today and gone tomorrow .
call off your guns .
what are you talking about?
your trouble is , you have too much time on your hands .
what you need is a job .
a what?
a job .
i'm gonna give you a job being a postman , understand?
it'll be your job to see the mail gets through .
see that gorilla down there?
that's butcher hicks , and he's killed three men .
you know how?
he tore them apart with his teeth .
never found all the pieces .
he has an unhealthy appetite .
so what?
so hicks there is my new pen pal .
i'll write him once a week ... ... about how i'm looking in on his sick mother ... ... and trying to get him special privileges here .
and the interesting part is , if anything happens to me ... ... and hicks doesn't get his letter ... ... he'll be really pissed off .
and he'll come to see you ... ... because you're the mailman .
he'll probably come down here and cancel your ass like a stamp .
you better ensure prompt , courteous delivery .
and pray nothing happens to me .
that's it?
that's it .
see that dirtbag i was talking to down there?
he says smoking can cause cancer ... ... and anyone who smokes as much as you do is one dumb son of a bitch .
fire !
cut !
cut !
cut .
where is that stupid fuck?
howser !
get your ass down here .
you're supposed to harpoon the goddamn dummy .
the tide shifted .
the tide shifted .
the ocean's incompetent , not you .
this is the third time this week .
you'll never work for me again .
there's a bunch of reporters down there .
come on , come on .
can we ask you a few questions?
please !
i'd like to say one thing .
in light of what's happened ... ... perhaps playing the dead pool game isn't smart .
any tie between the dead pool and squares 'death?
none whatsoever .
next question .
mr. swan , will the game continue?
no , we're filming a nightmare sequence at the shipyards ... ... and we'd like to forget this and get on with our job .
johnny would have wanted it that way .
first squares died , then your production accountant was killed .
is hotel satan cursed?
people can believe what they want , but nothing ....
nothing will stop me from making this film .
end of interview .
whatever you want , money , credit cards , just take it .
ever notice how time slows down at night?
just like in my films .
a dream world .
shut up !
i can't hear the colors .
i've got to hear them .
that's the mark of a good director , you have to hear the colors .
you've gotta be able to taste the sounds .
i have a heart condition .
a critic with a heart .
that's a laugh .
do you like my films?
i said , do you like my films?
who are you?
you know who i am .
i don't .
i don't know you .
god ... ... what kind of a film critic are you?
shadows of the dead !
hell without the devil !
night of the slasher !
peter swan .
brilliant , love .
what do you think of my films?
give me your honest opinion .
i like them .
liar !
the entrance is through the sliding glass door .
she wasn't sexually assaulted .
killed sometime last night .
maid found her this morning .
do you recognize her?
molly fisher .
famous movie critic .
on a scale of 1 to 10 , 10 being the best ... ...
i'd have to rate this one an 8 .
harry , we found this .
thanks .
dead pool .
molly fisher's also on peter swan's list .
oh , god , it's coming !
those are just some of the highlights of peter swan's films .
the typeface is the same as those sent to the papers and tv stations .
and the neighbor saw a man exiting molly fisher's condo last night .
mid 20s , wearing a black jacket .
i want swan in custody now .
it doesn't feel right .
doesn't feel right?
every celebrity on this list called in the last couple days .
they're all screaming for police protection .
we don't have the manpower to be 24 hour babysitters .
ackerman is whining about the negative publicity this case is giving us .
and your name is on this list too , callahan .
my gut feeling tells me swan is the best suspect we have ... ... so get his butt in here !
donnelly .
what?
it's for you , callahan .
we'll be right there .
wait a minute .
where are you going?
to do my job .
i think we've got our man .
you all stay back .
everyone .
i'm gonna go up .
where's the news crew?
you better get them here .
i mean it .
now !
what's up?
name's gus wheeler .
he says he's the dead pool killer .
we found him like this .
he's soaked in gas and threatening to set himself on fire .
why not hose him down?
he says if he sees a fireman or even a garden hose , he'll torch himself .
what's he want?
to be on television .
he wants a cameraman and a reporter .
al and i will just pose as
it has to be someone he recognizes .
stay back .
stay back from me .
it's gonna go up .
you hear me?
better keep those people back .
you all right?
not really .
stop right there !
that's far enough .
i'm samantha walker from
i know who you are !
what do you want?
is that camera on?
you want to know why i'm doing this?
because nobody cares .
we care , mr. whee
no !
nobody ever paid any attention to me before .
in order to get attention , you gotta do something .
well , i'm really gonna do something this time !
did you have anything to do with the deaths ... ... of johnny squares and molly fisher?
no , i just said that so you'd listen !
i want everyone to see this !
i want everyone to remember me !
and to remember what i did here !
oh , jesus , harry , he's really gonna do it .
that's right , lady .
i'm really gonna set myself on fire .
and it's gonna be on the news ... ... and then finally everybody will know about me .
about me !
gus wheeler !
no one's gonna see you die .
what?
i said , no one's gonna see you die .
not if we stop filming .
you can talk to me and tell me your story ... ... but we won't film your suicide .
what are you doing?
turn the camera back on !
we're not gonna film it !
we're not .
she's right .
you can set yourself on fire and we'll roast marshmallows .
but you won't be on news at 11 .
you're ruining everything .
give me the flare .
you've got plenty of coverage .
you think so?
trust me .
okay .
harry , you okay?
you hurt?
no , i'm fine .
get that gurney over here , quick !
you all right?
oh , god , harry .
this man sets himself on fire .
and it's my fault .
it was an accident .
maybe if we'd have kept filming .
that's exactly what he wanted .
what you did took guts .
most people would have gone for the exclusive .
reel three , george .
just a moment .
what is this?
why the fuck are you harassing me?
i was at a party when fisher was killed .
i was there until 2 , and i have witnesses .
we know that .
we checked .
somebody's trying to make us think that you killed squares and fisher .
any idea who it is?
are you kidding?
it could be anyone .
they all hate me .
my former agent .
my producers , my crew .
the public .
they envy my talent so much they wish to destroy it .
you don't believe me?
talk to my secretary .
she'll show you the letters i get .
warnings , death threats ....
i get so many , i don't pay attention anymore .
i'll check on it .
tell me ... ... anyone else have a jacket like this?
most of my crew .
why?
maybe it was someone in your crew , or who's worked for you in the past .
whoever's doing these murders uses your films and you as inspiration .
welcome to the nolan kennard show .
i say it's out of hand .
it's time we have guidelines for what we watch .
i don't want big brother out there telling me what to read or watch .
what's your opinion?
anybody can watch anything ... ... as long as it doesn't hurt somebody else .
take it easy .
give me a chance here .
who decides what's harmful?
isn't that what we're talking about?
first johnny squares , then molly fisher , now nolan kennard .
like i said , celebrities always die  in threes , yeah .
at least the guy went out with a  a bang , i know .
what do you have , russ?
hello , harry .
from the residue on the frags , i'd say plastic .
probably c2 or 4 .
we'll do an analysis back at the lab .
let me know the results .
you got it .
what's that?
i don't know .
it looks like the wheel from a toy .
have you been questioned about nolan kennard?
is his death connected to the dead pool?
i don't know .
is his death due to your list?
i don't know .
in hell without the devil ... ... a character's poisoned .
night of the slasher has several stabbings .
we can guess what hotel satan  get to the point .
are there parallels between the deaths in your film ...
... and the death of johnny squares?
that's a stupid question !
do you feel any responsibility?
you've blown this out of proportion .
you want to speak to somebody?
speak to the police .
talk to inspector callahan .
he'll tell you i'm not a suspect .
i have nothing to do with these deaths .
that's all i have to say , now sod off .
callahan !
you .
harry .
i think that's about it for me .
what's that tattoo?
oh , that .
one of my grandfather's superstitions .
you see , he painted these words on my back and chest .
it's supposed to ward off anything that's harmful or evil .
when he heard i was your partner , he figured i could use the help .
i was just trying to honor the old guy .
besides , i didn't think it could hurt .
listen , i think i'm gonna go home .
i'll catch you later for a beer .
see him?
i saw him .
he can't be over there .
how y'all doing?
you're the last asshole janero sends .
wait , you got it wrong !
don't fuck with me , buddy .
i'll kick your ass right now .
it's not what you think .
janero did hire us .
but this ain't a hit .
janero doesn't want anything to happen to you .
we're your ... ... bodyguards .
those letters all came from your files .
harlan rook . " god .
yes , i remember him .
every time i was at a film festival or a seminar , he was there .
mr. know it all , i called him .
he knew everything about my films .
to tell the truth , i found it a little unnerving .
what'd he want?
he had this screenplay for a horror film he wanted me to direct .
he said it'd be the ultimate peter swan film .
he was crazy .
i couldn't get rid of him .
finally , my attorney put a restraining order on him .
then what happened?
i didn't see or hear from him again .
that must have been over a year ago .
is he the one?
the typewriter used on these letters ... ... is the same one used to tip us off to the dead pool .
call swan's attorney and see what he knows about rook .
and run a dmv check on the address .
right .
it might not be a bad idea to start playing it a little safe .
maybe your granddaddy can paint me up .
look , i'm being serious .
don't go where you normally go , not even home .
you can stay with me .
thanks , but i think i can do a little better .
price of fame .
is this what ackerman meant by cooperating with the press?
it must have been one of those in depth interviews .
i got a lead on rook .
a psychiatrist who treated him .
good .
give it a try .
okay .
it won't respond .
someone's on my frequency .
forget it .
it's just not working .
now what the hell is that?
time's up , callahan .
you all right , al?
shit .
two fractured ribs .
he bled in the chest .
we drained it and set up an iv .
he's lucky , the bulletproof vest he had on saved his life .
another of my grandfather's superstitions .
when your partner gives you advice , take it .
harry .
this is dr. friedman , chief psychiatrist here at the hospital .
i'm sorry about what happened .
i feel somewhat responsible .
your partner contacted me about a former patient of ours .
harlan rook?
yes .
at first , i didn't recall the name .
i found the file today .
he was evaluated here a year ago .
the diagnosis was process schizophrenia .
multiple personality .
not exactly .
his sense of self hate was so strong ... ... that he no longer had any personality of his own .
consequently , he substituted identities ... ... found in books , films ... ... fan magazines .
identities with which he had love hate relationships .
he wasn't dangerous enough to hold?
most mentally ill people are not violent , inspector .
by law , a person who poses no danger can only be held for 72 hours .
i'm sorry , this is one instance where the system failed .
is this address recent?
i assume it's still the same .
samantha walker .
this is peter swan , ms. walker .
your coverage of my predicament has been thorough ... ... but my side hasn't been told as well as it could be .
i see .
i'm prepared to grant you an exclusive interview .
are you interested?
no doubt about it .
he's our boy , harry .
explosives .
caps .
detonator .
it all connects .
harry , you gotta see this .
talk about obsession .
looks like he had a real peter swan shrine going here .
i'm not sure .
i could have sworn i put it in my bag .
but i'm not sure .
bob , do you have my little mike?
it's in your bag .
thank you .
look at this .
i'll call the tv station .
samantha went out to the shipyard to interview peter swan .
swan doesn't know anything about it .
what's this?
a payroll stub .
sundown security , made out to ed butler?
i don't get it .
that's the company that provides security for swan's locations .
ed butler may be an alias for rook .
where are you going?
harry?
harry !
that's my car !
yes .
that's the shot i'm iooking for .
what is it you want from me?
you've got it wrong , love .
this is what you wanted .
an exclusive interview .
but you're not swan .
shut up !
you don't know !
you don't know !
i know who i am .
do you know who you are?
do you? !
yes .
all those films he made .
those are my nightmares , not his !
every night i dream , and somehow he reads my mind .
he stole my thoughts .
he put my thoughts on film , and he takes all the credit .
he can't get away with it .
he has to pay .
he stole my nightmares and made them real .
so i stole his dead pool .
i'll play his game and make it real .
he can take credit for that .
drop it , rook .
you didn't die , callahan , so i had to find another celebrity .
you're next .
shoot me , callahan .
maybe you'll get lucky .
maybe my muscles won't contract and drive this knife into her throat .
let her go .
first the gun .
drop it and kick it over to me .
time's up .
what's it gonna be?
what the fuck?
you've locked yourself in , asshole .
yeah .
just you and me , asshole .
the gun , callahan .
now !
no !
he'll kill us both !
oh , god .
you let me down , mr. famous fucking cop .
you let swan get away .
you're the killer , not swan .
i should've killed you first .
that was my big mistake .
now kick it over to me .
harry , don't .
think you're smart , don't you?
callahan , you son of a bitch !
i'm gonna kill you slow !
do you hear that , callahan? !
stay in there .
callahan !
come on out , callahan .
there's nowhere left to run , callahan .
don't make me come in and get you .
the game's over !
you're out of bullets .
you know what that means .
you're shit out of luck .
where's rook?
he's hanging out back there .
inspector , was this another hit attempt by janero?
is it connected to the dead pool case?
