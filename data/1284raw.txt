i can't  what?
you didn't get the white chocolate .

maybe he'll wonder why i'm all wet .
you sure you don't need a
buddy / can i get one of those?

morning / luther .
hi / mr. krank .
morning / mr. krank .
it'll be so different this christmas / won't it / luther?
yes / it will be so different .
nothing will be the same .
for the first time in 23 years / blair won't be here .
might even get depressing .
lot of depression at christmas / you know?
yeah / well ....
i would just love to forget about it .
what are you looking at?
why are you looking at me like that?
finish your pasta .
i'm finished with my pasta .
it's you i'm not finished with .
i'll be right back .
you wait right there .
okay .
luther?
what are you doing?
it's not even saturday night .
i have an idea .
yeah?
a brilliant idea .
make sure you shut the curtains .
all right .
come over here .
turn around .
what are you doing?
sit down .
button up and sit down .
look at this .
this is a little ledger of what we spent last year for christmas .
look at some of this stuff .
what is this / $63 for ornament repair?
you got to be kidding me .
look at the total .
we spent $6/ 100 on christmas last year . $6/ 100 on
i heard you the first time .
with precious little to show for it .
where is this going?
the caribbean .
a 10 day luxury cruise on the jubilee .
the most luxurious ship in their fleet .
cayman lslands .
snorkeling .
we go to jamaica .
we windsurf / whatever the heck that is .
look at the picture here .
the bahamas .
we sit in the sun .
10 days / luxury cruise / you and me .
i might have to lose a little weight .
heck / i'll lose it for you .
what's the catch?
i wouldn't call it a catch .
we skip christmas .
we skip christmas?
we skip christmas / save the money / and spend it on us for a change .
i don't know .
come on / please .
you and i go bask in the caribbean sun .
how much is this gonna cost? $3/ 000 .
we save money?
absolutely .
we can still give our charitable donations ... to children's hospital and / of course / the church .
no / this is a total boycott / honey .
total .
it's $600 .
it's a total boycott .
i'm afraid that's all i'm gonna say about that .
well / then / no .
what a stupid idea .
you're gonna let a lousy $600 stand between us and a caribbean cruise .
no .
you are .
all right / look .
i'll match last year's contribution to the church and to the hospital ... but not a penny more .
when do we leave?
high noon / christmas day .
it's not even saturday night .
i will not be celebrating christmas this year .
as many of you know / blair has joined ... the peace corps .
so nora and i have decided to avoid the rituals of christmas ... save our money / and take a cruise .
therefore , i will not be participating in the usual holiday rituals .
i will buy no gifts and accept none .
thank you , anyway .
i will not attend the firm's black tie christmas dinner ... nor will i be here for the office party .
i am not angry and i will not yell ... " humbug " at anyone who offers me a holiday greeting .
i am simply skipping christmas .
hello / mrs. krank .
hello / aubie / how are you?
i'm just a little worried about your christmas cards .
why are you worried?
you always select the most beautiful cards .
you really should put your order in .
we're not gonna be ordering christmas cards this year .
do what?
you heard me .
may i ask why not?
you know / i'm really quite late for lunch .
bye bye .
say hi to your mom .
but we always have a live band at the auction .
yeah / but last year / the band cost $15/ 000 .
we hired a deejay for the cancer ball .
ladies .
hi / aubie .
hello .
mrs. krank / we forgot to talk about your christmas invitations .
we won't be needing those / either .
no party?
no christmas eve party?
no party this year .
she's not ordering christmas cards either .
what's up?
we're ... taking a break .
we're not gonna do christmas this year .
how do you simply not do christmas?
you skip it .
but then what do we do christmas eve?
you'll think of something .
there are plenty of other parties .
but none like yours .
that's sweet .
when do you leave?
christmas day .
that's an odd time to travel .
apparently / not that many people travel on december 25th ... and so luther got us a great deal .
then why don't you have the party anyway?
because we don't want to / merry .
we're taking a break .
one year off / no christmas whatsoever .
what do we do?
i don't know .
mr. krank / i'm randy scanlon .
we're selling christmas trees again this year .
got yours right here .
you got a canadian blue spruce last year .
this one's a real beauty .
almost 10 feet tall .
mrs. krank likes the big ones .
aren't they cute?
how much is the big one? $90 .
we had to go up a little .
we're not buying a christmas tree this year .
luther .
we talked about this .
sorry we had to go up on the price .
we're making less per tree than last year .
it's not about the money .
we're not doing christmas this year .
we're gonna go away on a cruise .
we don't need a tree .
all right .
well / out of the frying pan ... and into the fire .
luther .
what?
come here .
why?
come here .
what are they doing?
who?
spilling their guts to frohmeyer .
not frohmeyer .
are you intimidated by vic frohmeyer?
honey / he's like the unelected ward boss of the street .
so frohmeyer has a problem with our skipping christmas?
who's he gonna call?
the three wise men?
santa claus?
don't underestimate him / honey .
vic frohmeyer lives and breathes for this neighborhood .
you should've just bought the tree .
no .
you didn't have to put it up .
no .
you could've left it in the backyard .
quiet .
why are you whispering?
this is our house .
i'm whispering for the same reason you're hiding behind that curtain .
hey / walt .
luther krank just stiffed the scouts on a christmas tree .
can you believe that / mr. frohmeyer?
do not put it up there .
i want them on the back of the house .
move it to the right .
the other right .
becker's at it again .
evening / vic .
everybody's going to really miss blair this year .
the whole block's talking about it .
how is she doing?
she's doing just fine .
thanks for asking .
how's your family?
ln great spirits .
we're putting up decorations tonight .
wind it tight / spike !
hi / dad !
looks good / mama !
it's the greatest time of year / don't you think?
i couldn't be happier .
it's not gonna be the same without blair here .
of course not .
honey / are you okay?
come here .
honey !
give me a hand .
there are certain things around here that i'm gonna miss at christmas .
so you're ... really skipping out?
you got it .
somehow / it just doesn't seem right .
that's really not up to you to decide / is it?
but i got to tell you / the neighbors are pretty upset .
really?
christmas has always been a neighborhood thing around here .
you know that .
everybody decorates .
everybody bakes cookies / and swaps gifts .
i guess we do it for the kids .
lf you're trying to make me feel guilty / get off of it .
and you know what else?
i'd appreciate it if you ... and everyone else around here would just respect my wishes .
whatever you say / luther .
weather should be clear tomorrow .
perfect time to put up frosty .
frosty?
tell you what / truth is / if i'm gone / i'm ....
vic?
frosty is a christmas tradition .
frosty is a christmas decoration .
i will not be told by vic frohmeyer that i have to decorate my house for christmas .
why won't you put up frosty?
it's the principle thing .
do you understand?
we can forget about christmas if we damn well choose .
and nobody / not even vic frohmeyer / can stop us .
i will not be forced into doing this .
have a good day .
hi / nora .
morning / bev .
hi / walt .
hey / nora !
it was an accident .
walt / why don't you put that cat of yours on a leash?
only dogs wear leashes / old man .
think you can run away from christmas?
i'm trying to .
guess it's a good way to save money .
it's not about the money .
yeah / sure .
muffles / be polite .
will you two ever be friends?
you know / i'd like to say yes / but ....
how you feeling today / bev?
have my good days and bad days .
today's a good day .
i'm glad to hear that .
come have your breakfast / dear .
i got to get to work .
still working for the man / huh?
as a matter of fact / it is a man i work for .
thought they would've made you partner by now .
i got to get to work .
have a good one / old man .
one snowball with a little yellow spot on it .
just skim the top of that little head of his .
just like that .
old man .
bah / humbug .
good morning / mr. scrooge .
morning / dox .
do i have any messages?
wal mart called .
said i had to buy my own cheap perfume since santa claus isn't coming this year .
funny .
nora krank !
we're here for frosty !
hello .
luther .
hey / babe .
they're here .
who?
vic frohmeyer / wes trogdon / ned becker / and a gang of their kids .
we're here for frosty !
they want frosty .
they can't have him .
nora !
please give us frosty .
honey / where is frosty?
he's down behind the furnace .
why?
they won't go away .
don't give them frosty .
you and luther do not have to do anything !
just leave frosty on the front porch .
we'll put him up for you .
they said they'll put him up for us .
absolutely not .
please / luther .
no !
we'll come back later .
and frosty better be here .
they're gonna come back !
listen to you .
you're panicking on the phone in a locked house ... because the neighbors are going door to door ... to set up a ridiculous 7 foot tall snowman !
sure / easy for you to say .
miles away in the safety of your office .
yeah / well
i am the one trapped here .
i am the one dealing with this !
all right / i agree .
so maybe it's time that you left the neighborhood .
sure / honey .
how do you think i'm gonna do that?
the street is blocked with all of our neighbors .
walk to the garage / get in the car / start it / drive to the mall ...
i'll meet you at o'leary's .
do it now !
you can do this !
do it before
bit more to the left .
that looks good .
hi / mrs. krank .
nora?
vic / she's leaving !
what's she doing?
i'm so sorry .
sorry !
nora / stop the car .
stop the car .
please / listen .
don't do anything you'll regret .
now / please / indulge me for a second .
stop the car .
listen to me .
give us frosty .
stop the car .
we just want frosty .
talk to me .
please . lndulge me for a second .
it's us women who handle christmas / not men .
i am the one taking the brunt for your harebrained scheme .
i am the one on the frontlines .
i have a surprise for you .
what?
shut your eyes .
all right / open them .
honey / is this some kind of joke?
no / i got one / too .
what do you think?
a woman's bathing suit?
probably belongs with that .
nope / got my own .
look at that .
little cliff diver thing .
honey / there is no way we are wearing these on this cruise .
these aren't for the cruise .
you know what's odd?
ls when an lrish pub serves fish tacos .
i don't get that .
i got a little heartburn .
i don't think i'm gonna do that again .
here it is / right here .
come on .
follow me / and don't mention her eyes .
hello / mr. krank .
hi / daisy .
this is my wife / nora .
hello .
i really don't want to do this .
no / come on .
i got a great deal . $60 / 1 2 visits .
why would we get a tan before the cruise?
i thought the whole point was to get a tan during the cruise .
look at our skin .
we kind of look like uncooked chicken .
you look like a corpse .
and you could use a little help yourself .
thank you .
dear god / this should be outlawed .
okay / calm down .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hello !
i need a band ald .
nora krank?
father zabriskie .
hello .

i'm looking for a band ald .
jeez / lady / make up your mind .
nora / i hear it from a good source that you and luther ... have decided not to observe christmas this year .

attendant said you were bleeding .

luther .
hey / there .
father zabriskie .
hey .
we've made the front page .
check it out .
hold on .
" skipping christmas .
yep .
the home of mr. and mrs. luther krank is rather dark this christmas .
while their neighbors on hemlock street are decorating and preparing for santa ...
the kranks are skipping christmas .
they're preparing for a cruise / according to unnamed sources .
no tree / no lights / and no frosty up on the roof ...
and the only house on hemlock to keep frosty in the basement .
how do they know where frosty is?
they have spies everywhere .
hemlock / a frequent winner in the gazette street decoration contest ...
finished a disappointing sixth this year . " 'i hope they're satisfied now / 'complained one unidentified neighbor . " 'a rotten display of selfishness / 'said another .
who said that?
could've been anybody .
how dare they !
what a bunch of losers .
you know what?
you know / i don't think i'm coming back from this cruise .
attagirl .
two more days and we're out of here .
two more / baby .
jerks .
chocolate milk?
sure .
that's mine .
regular .
sorry i'm late .
hey .
what's wrong?
it's bev scheel .
could you cover for me?
sure .
what happened?
she went for a checkup yesterday .
the cancer's back for the third time .
has it spread?
they think so .
that's awful .
this could be her last christmas .
sweetheart .
well / if it isn't old scrooge himself .
how do you think this photographer got this shot?
what photographer?
the one that took this photograph .
that one .
yeah / that one .
he climbed up .
on your roof?
yeah .
why did you do that?
i don't know .
he said he wanted to get a shot of the whole street .
at least you're consistent .
i try to be / old man .
stop that .
stop what?
stop calling me " old man .
you're / like / 10 years older than me .
am l?
yeah .
prove it .
walt .
i just heard about bev .
i am so sorry .
how's she doing?
remarkably well . ln good spirits .
decorating the house / baking cookies .

thanks .
i really appreciate that .
they're here for frosty .
no .
i'll get it .
thank you .
good evening / mr. krank .
good evening / officers .
it's that time of year again .
your police benevolent association's out there raising money for the community .
that's great .
you know / toys for tots / and we deliver gift baskets for the underprivileged .
and ice skating for handicapped kids .
every year / we deliver presents for the elderly at the nursing homes ... and / of course / our war veterans .
our big moneymaker is our calendar ... and you buy one every year / so here we are .
we don't need a calendar this year .
what a jerk .
he said he didn't need one .
thank you for your contribution .
merry christmas .
yeah / merry christmas .
good luck with it .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
we're from st. maria's lutheran church out caroling .
are those folks home?
yes / they are .
are they jewish?
no .
buddhist or anything?
no / none of that .
they're just trying to avoid christmas this year .
do what?
you heard me .
he's kind of weird .
skipping christmas so he can save his money for a cruise .
no .
i think some christmas cheer would do them good .
really?
why don't you go ahead?
all righty then .
drop .
down !
go !
this is fun .
christmas carolers right out next to our junipers .
how lovely .
it's not lovely .
they're trespassing .
somebody set us up .
they're not trespassing .
yes / they are .
they're on our property .
they weren't invited .
somebody told them to come .
scheel or frohmeyer .
christmas carolers are not trespassers .
i know what i'm talking about here .
why don't you have them arrested / then?
i just may do that .
call your friends down at the police department .
that's funny .
not too late to buy a calendar .
this isn't a joke .
this is military .
this is seal stuff .
i saw it on discovery channel .
come on .
just sit right here .
here you go .
right here .
there .
that's perfect .
quietest room in the house .
no one can find us down here .
free frosty !
free frosty !
merry christmas / mrs. krank .
luther !
every who down in who ville liked christmas a lot .
but the grinch who lived just north of who ville did not .
the grinch hated christmas / the whole christmas season .
now / please don't ask why / no one quite knows the reason .
it could be his head wasn't screwed on just right .
it could be / perhaps / that his shoes were too tight .
but i think that the most likely reason of all ...
may have been that his heart was two sizes too small .
luther , your face .
what about it?
it's like it's frozen or something .
this?
i got a botox injection today .
botox treatment .
they take a big needle and they inject it into your forehead .
it freezes your face like this .
i read it in a health magazine .
how long are you gonna be like this?
this is temporary .
and then you got all your wrinkles are gone .
you should try this .
you ought to get your money back .
i can't live like this anymore .
what?
we can't go out .
everywhere we go / people are whispering behind our backs .
i can't go home .
it's too depressing .
i mean / there's no tree and no lights and no music .
i can't talk to you .
you're just consumed with yourself .
that's not true .
look how far you've gone .
amazing .
turning our lawn into an ice rink .
i can't feel anything .
somebody could've broken their leg or their neck .
you could've put a caroler in the hospital .
and that would be a bad thing?
i'm kidding .
i know this has been tough on you .
but in just one day / 24 hours / we'll be on that trip .
and it's all gonna be better .
i promise .
i don't know .
do you think that blair will even think about christmas?
probably not .
i mean / she's in the rainforest ... and around people who worship trees ... and eat bark and frogs and that sort of stuff .
you gonna wear that?
absolutely .
nice .
free frosty !
i know this is you / spike .
goodbye .
again?
how many times is that?
about five or six times .
wish i had a snappy comeback for that smart guy .

we've been friends for years .
and he's just so wonderful .
we fell in love while working together ... and he's asked me to marry him .
what?
and i really want to .
honey !
enrique has always gone home for the holidays / so he's ... never celebrated christmas in america .
and he's so excited .

i love you , mommy .
i love you too / honey .

she should've called sooner .
but she didn't .
why did you tell her we're having that party?
because we are .
i need my vest .
i don't know who's coming to the party or what they're gonna eat ... but we're having a party .
what about our trip?
don't even start with me .
this was all your stupid idea .
stupid idea?
five minutes ago / i was a genius .
now you're an idiot .
how does one call change so much?
don't dwell on the past / lsland boy / we're having a party .
cheese / wine and blairey's favorite : hickory honey ham .
who's coming to this party?
i haven't gotten that far yet .
you're in charge of the tree .
we don't have one .
get one and put it up .
then you will get your little brown butt down to the basement and put up frosty .
no !
yes !
we are going to perform a little christmas miracle .
lf we pull it off / blairey is never gonna know ... about your stupid / ridiculous / childish scheme ... of skipping christmas .
i'm sorry about this little ugly bush .

yeah .
how much is it? $75 .

hey / wes .

he's all right .

he was up there by himself / trying to put up your frosty .
sweetie / here they come .
here come the pros .
guys .
just hold on .
i guess you can't / can you?
hurry up !
back off / i'll be all right .

you okay?
dudes / over here .
slow down .
that's good .
over here / man .
folks / move back .
what's going on here?
luther here was up on the roof putting up frosty and then they both fell off .
coming through .
i thought you were skipping christmas this year / mr. krank .
what about that?
what's going on there?
blair's coming home for christmas .

we'll put them along luther's boxwoods .
hold on .
why should we do this for him?
yeah .
he's a jerk .
regardless of how you feel about him a lot of you have mixed feelings about him .
but we're a community .
the people in a community stick together .
even if one of them has been behaving / for most of the holiday season ...
like a spoiled / selfish little baby .
we're not doing this for him .
we're doing this for blair .
blair / who used to baby sit all your kids .
blair / who comes home every summer and makes us all feel like family .
that's right .
why should the daughter pay for the sins of the father?
now / if we even have a hope of pulling this off / you got to scatter .
grab a change of clothes and all the food you can / and get over here in half an hour .
let's go .
randy / mike / let's go .
thank you !
you're welcome / nora .
guys / better go to the airport .
why's that?
blair needs a ride home .
i don't know if we could do that .
shall i call the chief?
we could do that .
got a hold of frosty there?
easy .
up he goes .
there you go .

here's to my new family and friends .
thank you for making me feel so welcome .
and i just wanted to say ... thank you to all of you .
to our friends and our neighbors ... for helping us make this ... really / the most wonderful christmas eve ever .
you really have shown us the true meaning of community .
and thank you all so much .
merry christmas .
same goes for me / double .
cheers .
fellas / how about a party tune?
g.
that was it?
that was the best you could come up with?
i'm not really good at toasts .
after all they've done ... you couldn't just come up with a simple " thank you "?
i did .
it was just short and sweet .
you're still moping ... because you don't get to go on your precious little cruise .
there's still time .
what?
we could still go .
listen to me .
enrique and blair can stay here / have the house to themselves .
we go / and we all have a romantic getaway .
your daughter just flew thousands of miles home ... with her very sweet future husband ... to spend christmas with us .
you know ...
i've spent six weeks planning for this vacation .
that's longer than they've been dating .
everyone out there sacrificed their christmas eve to help us .
i thought maybe that might affect you .
maybe have you start thinking about putting others first instead of yourself .
but i really don't think that's possible .
it's a shame .
why don't we move in a little?
hi / how are you?
merry christmas to you .
it's cold out there .
bravo !
luther !
frosty?
merry christmas / luther .
merry christmas to you / too / walt .
you're missing your party .
well / there's ....
how's bev?
she's having a good day .
yeah / thanks .
we started over to see blair / but / you know / the snow started and ....
so how's the boyfriend?
you know / actually / he's a very nice young man .
merry christmas / luther .
merry christmas to you / too / bev .
you feeling okay?
that was a pretty nasty fall .
it could've been worse .
i mean / that cord could've snapped and ....
you know / nora wanted me to drop this by .
i'm allergic to pork / and bev's not much of a meat eater .
not to worry / because mel's hams are generally just filled ... with a gelatin and a fat like substance .
please .
it's very thoughtful / luther .
you know / have a good one .
could i come in for a minute?
thanks .
blair's gonna be staying with us for 10 days ... so we're not taking the cruise .
and nora and i would like you guys to have it .
flight leaves at 1 2 : 00 noon tomorrow .
you got to be there two hours ahead of time .
it's 10 days in the caribbean .
lslands and beaches .
the works .
it's a dream vacation .
we can't take it / luther .
it's not right .
i didn't purchase the travel insurance .
so if you don't take it / the whole package is wasted .
i'm not sure my doctor would allow it .
i've got that lexon deal on the front burner .
benny said he might stop by tomorrow .
and we couldn't leave the cat .
this is from us to you .
this is a sincere / heartfelt ... no strings attached christmas offering ... to two very selfless people who are / at this moment ... having a very difficult time looking for an excuse .
benny did say he might stop by .
face it / bev / benny hasn't been home in years .
look / i've got everything right here .
i got airline tickets .
i got cruise passes .
i've got a brochure .
what's it cost? lf we decide to go / we'd want to reimburse you .
this is a simple gift / walt .
no costs / no payback .
don't make it complicated .
our names aren't on the tickets .
i know .
i'll take care of that .
what about the cat?
yeah / that's a problem / huh?
too late to call the kennel .
we can't just leave him .
we could ask jude becker .
she's allergic .
i'll take the cat .
what?
are you sure?
yeah .
look at that .
see?
maybe if you don't step on him so often ....
yeah .
it'll be fine .
thank you so much .
merry christmas .
well / i should get back to my party .
this means so much .
thank you .
you're welcome .
does this mean we have to start being nice to each other?
of course not .
good .
because i still don't like you that much / old man .
that's good .
i'm not that fond of you / either .
bev / we gotta pack !
luther !
help me !
ned !
what in god's name are you doing up there?
blair came home .
frohmeyer took down the ladder .
he went inside / forgot about me .
have you been up there all this time?
i'm frozen / stuck to frosty !
i'll get you down !
what are you doing?
you swore on your kids 'lives !
what kids?
help !
police !
easy / come on .
go on inside .
drink something hot .
get down from there .
get down off the roof !
my car .
you all right?
what's in that bag?
not bad .
good job / santa .
all right / come on .
get up here .
let's go .
you swore to me .
i'm growing tired of catching you .
what's this all about?
what's going on?
i told you you could use an umbrella .
what?
marty .
yes .
wait .
you're the guy that was selling the umbrellas in the rain / aren't you?
it's a living .
i meet a lot of nice people this way .
i got to run because i can't pass up this kind of weather .
it's always good for business .
thank you for the party .
you're welcome .
i'm sorry you got to work on christmas eve .
santa always has to work on christmas eve .
yeah / i suppose he does .
merry christmas !
bev scheel just called .
maybe i was wrong about you .
this night is full of surprises .
skipping christmas .
what a stupid idea .
maybe next year .
merry christmas !
