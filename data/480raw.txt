hull breach contained .
engines operating at 170 % capacity .
engine and hull failure imminent under current parameters .
a lot of questions , whoever we run into .
could even be ... a merc ship .
critical systems failure in five seconds .
four seconds .
three seconds .
two seconds .
one second .
first you're a boy , then you're a girl , and now you're a psychic .
careful what you wish for , jack .

name's johns .
my ship got scrapped on a transport run .
the only other survivors from the whole mess are with me .
outside of that , we got nothing .
tell me , mr. johns , what brings you to this lonely corner of space?
i'm a bounty hunter .
then it appears we have something in common .
bring them in .
they're reelin 'us in .
ship is secure in bay 3 .
no offense , but i don't think that's gonna cut it ... against whatever it is that's coming for us .
report .
two heat signatures .
adults .
there's some residual as well .
could be a juvenile .
more likely burn off from the engines .
find out .
hold your breath .
running a tighter sweep .
wait a minute .
what is it?
it's the sweep .
according to what i'm getting , they're gone .
gone?
nothing inside that ship's putting out heat anymore .
how that's possible ...
anything?
no , sir .
no one's been in or out of this bay since i locked it down myself .
zero atmosphere .
pressurize .
we've got o 2 , sir .
it's thin , but you'll be able to breathe it .
green for breach .
earn your keep .
there is a man inside this vessel who is something far worse ... than anyone here has ever encountered .
should you survive this day , it is one you will remember for the rest of your lives .
do not underestimate the importance of such a thing .
begin .
extinguishing foam .
fall back !
everyone fall back !
he has to breathe sometime .
you certainly know how to make an entrance .
that's nothing , scarecrow .
he's gonna kick your ass so hard ...
i think not .
what do you say?
call off your lap dog , before his trying to impress you gets him killed .
am i so obvious?
call it what you want , but tell him to stand down , now .
you'll have to excuse junner's excitement .
it sometimes makes him a touch ... quick .
though i can't say i blame him .
you see , he's just heard so much about you ,
riddick .
yes , i know your name .
quite a bit more about you , i think .
careful .
you may find what you're digging for .
i'm willing to share , of course , but i must ask that you surrender your weapon ... before any more of my apparently overpaid associates ... come to an untimely end .
not gonna happen .
no?
the girl is nothing to me .
then enlighten me .
why would a stone cold killer such as yourself ... go to all the trouble ofkeeping the likes ofher alive?
unless , of course , you've grown attached .
she's a cover story , nothing more .
you shoot her now , and you'll be saving me the trouble .
then i have your blessing .
maybe i know more about you than you do yourself .
now just ain't the time .
lock them down .
we're done here .
my apologies .
you know how worthless those are to me .
you did well .
people die in this line of work , junner .
a handful of men?
a small price to pay .
what will you do with him?
slowly , junner .
have riddick brought to my conservatory .
i've something beautiful in mind .
and , junner , unfreeze some more mercs .
have you ever seen anything like this before?
merc ships?
plenty .
just trying to figure out how it all goes together .
it is a plantation operation .
a boat like this loads up at port , signs on as many men as it can hold , then goes out for months , sometimes years at a time .
however long it takes to fill their stores .
except a merchant rig's usually harvesting ore , maybe crops , not people .
captured bounties on one side , contracted manpower on the other .
just add heat .
you know a lot about this shit ... for a holy man .
i hear things .
must be a special kind of desperate dick signs on to this .
shut up !
you're the exception , of course .
for you , it's life experience .
so , what's the plan?
it's not like we haven't gotten out of worse .
the way i see it , we can take these jerks when ...
hey !
this is where we get off , princess .
you too , preacher .
i will pray .
not for me .
let's go !
i won't leave without you , riddick !
i'll find you !
set him down and leave .
hmm .
the hell ...
all right .
now you have my attention .
a necessary precaution .
you attempt anything uncivilized ... killing me , for instance ...
i detonate the explosive charge junner's just implanted ... and sleep very well tonight .
walk with me .
you're not putting me on a pedestal .
no .
of course not .
you're strictly for my private collection .
miss me?
mmm .
fresh as a daisy .
suit up and report .
must be something big , them taking you off ice after what you pulled .
sister , i certainly aim to find out .
hmm .
okay .
you go through all the trouble to catch these guys , and this is what you do with them .
you're missing the point .
what point?
you got a million u. d. 's standing around collectin'dust .
you underestimate their value , riddick .
they are priceless .
each , at one time , the most wanted man or woman in the known universe .
the number oflives ended at the hands of those ...
living and breathing in this room is incalculable .
ain't what i'd call living .
just the same , i assure you they are all very much alive .
each one sustained in a form of cryo so profound ... that seconds seem weeks ... and to blink an eye is a day's work .
the brain , however , continues to function unimpeded .
the mind continues to think and feel , swarming with whatever dark thoughts it's trapped alone with , as it will be for hundreds of years .
so much more fitting a fate than dropping them off at the nearest slam .
here , they are appreciated for what they truly are , transformed into objects on par with their lives'work .
and why?
because i gave them the audience they so desperately desired , the recognition they bought with the blood of others .
i understood their actions , stripped free of moral convention .
don't you see?
they're something greater now , riddick .
something more than they ever were before .
art .
lady , your taste sucks .
i expected as much .
junner .
you see , riddick , there is a fundamental difference between you and i.
yeah .
you're a psychopath .
you don't appreciate art .
but i believe the reason for this is something very different ... than you or anyone else might think .
you're an artist .
i've been called a lot of things in my day .
that ain't one of'em .
you make art , riddick , not analyze it .
you shape it with your own hands , carve it from flesh and bone .
but a man like you does not understand such a thing by being lectured .
you must experience it .
oh , shit .
i said i'd find you , didn't i?
what do you want?
to watch you work .
i've spent the latter half of my life observing fantastic things ... the work of terrible men , men such as yourself ... but it's always after the fact ... when the moment of bloody creation is cold and passed .
that changes now .
i need to see it , riddick .
i need to see it with my own eyes as it happens .
i get outta there alive , you'll see it again ... this close .
no , riddick .
i want your masterpiece .
an artist is nothing without his instrument .
when we meet again , i'm gonna bury this in your eye .
let him in .
go ultraviolet .
i was on a pilgrimage .
just a pilgrimage .
this is bad , huh?
give it a minute .
imam , pray .
get her on her feet .
i cannot see !
you don't want to .
you wanna go?
let's go .
beautiful , beautiful creature .
shrill are an exquisite species .
i'm talking about the man .
they're gonna kill him !
huh?
no !
riddick?
here !
bravo !
the grace , the expression , the sheer violence of it .
exquisite .
give ...
what?
give me the knife .
such a complete and thorough performance .
it leaves only one question .
i got a feeling you're not gonna like it .
how will i ever have you mounted ... to do it justice?
what are you ...
no !
eww !
you gonna keep that?
looks like you'll have to be an abstract piece .
down !
now !
we'll need to rouse a substantial pursuit force .
who?
all of them !
even the galls !
any man or thing that can hold a weapon !
every last one !
now !
all right .
just what's the big deal?
oh !
jumping jesus .
oh , come to papa , you beautiful bald bastard .
toombs , what in the hell are you doing?
just gathering intel .
yeah , well , stow it .
we got a couple of runners to bring in .
shoot on sight .
yes , sir .
what in the hell happened here?
shut up and take point .
burn 'em .
grab your panties , boys .
what the hell was that?
don't move .
turn it loose .
huh?
what the ...
you're badly hurt .
him?
he almost tore me in half .
just a graze this time .
that bitch .
move !
we cannot stop .
we're not outrunning this thing , not the three of us .
what?
i can keep up !
maybe someday .
get her to the flight deck .
it's just aft , upper level .
yeah .
stow in there and let whatever's following pass .
when it does , make for the flight deck and don't look back , no matter what you hear .
we'll wait for you .
follow imam .
what are you going to do?
now where do we gotta go to meet up with ridd ...
jack , shh .
we've got to help him , imam .
we can't help him if we leave .
sometimes that is exactly how it works .
sweep it .
i got something .
check it out .
don't touch that !
oh , shit .
i ain't putting that back on .
let her go .
hmm .
it's me you're after .
you want a shot at the title?
i told you that was coming .
wh where are you going?
gonna prep this ship and get off this heap .
so we can escape?
it is over .
we have survived .
back to hell with you , you bloody stinking savage !
im ...
yeah , we made it .
awfully uncivilized thing you just did there , jack .
riddick .
trouble?
yes .
it is nothing back there .
what worries me lies ahead of us .
jack .
i am concerned for her , riddick , that she'll become ...
like me .
what is that place?
that's nowhere .
i'm dropping you guys on new mecca .
riddick .
we ain't done , boy .
not by a long shot .
hold your breath .
there is a man inside this vessel who is something far worse ... than anyone here has ever encountered .
hold your breath .
should you survive this day , it is one you will remember for the rest of your life .
do not underestimate the importance of such a thing .
hold your breath .
fall back .
everyone fall back .
here , they are appreciated for what they truly are , transformed into objects on par with their lives'work .
because i gave them the audience they so desperately desired , the recognition they bought with the blood of others .
