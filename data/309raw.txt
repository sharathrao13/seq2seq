you cannot pass !
gandalf !
i'm the servant of the secret fire , wielder of the flame of anor .
go back to the shadow !
you shall not pass !
no !
no !
gandalf !
fly , you fools !
nooooooooo !
gandalf !
what is it mr. frodo?
nothing .
just a dream .
mordor .
the one place in middle earth we don't want to see any closer .
it's the one place we are trying to get to .
it's just where we cant get .
let's face it mr. frodo .
we're lost .
i don't think gandalf meant for us to come this way .
he didn't mean for a lot of things to happen , sam .
... but they did .
mr. frodo?
it's the ring isn't it?
it's getting heavier .
what food have we got left?
well , let me see .
oh yes , lovely
lembas bread !
and look !
more lembas bread .
i don't usually hold to foreign food , but this elvish stuff is not bad .
nothing ever dampens your spirits , does it sam?
those rainclouds might .
this looks strangely familiar .
that's because we've been here before !
we are going in circles !
ah !
what's that 'orrid stink?
i'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby .
can you smell it?
yes i can smell it .
we are not alone .
those thieves !
those filthy little thieves !
where is it?
where is it?
they stole it from us
my precious .
we hate them !
we hate them !
we want it !
this is sting .
you've seen it before ! haven't you , gollum !
release him or i'll cut your throat !
it burns !
it burns us !
take it off !
quiet you !
it's hopeless !
every orc in mordor will hear this racket !
let's tie him up and leave him !
no !
that will kill us , kill us !
it's nothing more than you deserve !
maybe he does deserve to die .
now that i've seen him , i do pity him .
we be very nice to hobbits , you be nice to us .
we swear to do what you wants .
we swear !
there is no promise you make that i can trust .
we swear ... ... to serve the master ... ... of the precious .
we swear on ... ... on the precious .
gollum , gollum .
the ring is treacherous .
it will hold you to your word .
yes ... ... on the precious .
on the preciouss .
i don't believe you !
get down !
get down !
sam !
he was trying to trick us !
we let him go he'll throttle us into our sleep !
do you know the way to mordor?
yes .
you've been there before?
yes .
you will lead us to the black gate .
merry !
merry !
what is it?
what do you smell?
man flesh .
aragorn .
they've picked up our trail !
let's go !
their pace quickens .
they must have caught our scent .
hurry !
come on gimli !
three day's and night's pursuit .
no food ... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell .
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall .
they may yet be alive .
less than a day ahead of us , come !
come gimli !
we are gaining on them .
i'm wasted on cross country .
we dwarves are natural sprinters .
very dangerous we are over short distances .
rohan , home of the horse lords .
there's something strange at work here .
some evil gives speed to these creatures .
sets it's will against us .
legolas !
what does your elf eyes see?
the orcs turn northeast .
they are taking the hobbits to isengard !
saruman .
the world is changing .
who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard ... and mordor?
to stand against the might of sauron and saruman ... ... and the union of the two towers?
together , lord sauron , ... we shall rule this middle earth .
the old world will burn in the fires of industry .
forests will fall .
a new order will rise .
we will drive the machinery of war with the sword ... ... and the spear and the iron fist of the orcs .
we now have only to remove those who oppose us .
the horsemen have taken your lands .
they drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of rocks .
murderers !
take back the lands they stole from you .
burn every village !
it will begin in the rohan .
too long have these peasants stood against you .
but no more .
othain !
othain !
take your sister .
you'll go faster with just two .
but papa says eothain must not ride .
he's too big for him !
listen to me !
you must ride to edoras and raise the alarm
do you understand me?
yes mum !
i don't wanna go !
i don't wanna go , mama !
freda , listen to me .
i will find you there .
quickly !
go , child !
rohan , my lord ... ... is ready to fall .
thodred !
your son is badly wounded , my lord .
he was ambushed by orcs .
if we don't defend our country , saruman will take it by force .
that is a lie !
saruman the white has ever been our friend and ally .
grim .
grim .
grim .
orcs are roaming freely across our lands .
unchecked , unchallenged , killing at will .
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman .
why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
can you not see?
your uncle is weary of your malcontent . ... your warmongering .
warmongering?
how long has it been since saruman bought you?
what was the promised price , grim?
when all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure?
too long have you watched my sister .
too long have you haunted her steps .
you see much , omer son of omund .
too much .
you are banished forthwith from the kingdom of rohan ... ... under pain of death .
keep breathing , that's the key !
breathe !
ho !
they run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them .
we ain't goin 'no further ... ... till we've had a breather .
get the fire going !
merry !
merry !
i think , we might have made a mistake leaving the shire , pippin .
what's making that noise?
it's the trees .
what?
you remember the old forest?
on the borders of buckland?
folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall ... ... and come alive .
alive?
trees that could whisper ... ... talk to each other ... ... even move .
i'm starving .
we ain't 'ad nothin 'but maggoty bread for three stinkin 'days !
yeah !
why can't we have some meat?
what about them?
they're flesh !
they are not for eating !
what about their legs?
they don't need those .
ooh !
they look tasty !
get back !
just a mouthful?
no !
looks like meat's back on the menu boys !
pippin !
let's go !
go on , call for help .
squeal !
no one's gonna save you now !
pippin !
a red sun rises .
blood has been spilled this night .
riders of rohan !
what news from the mark?
what business does an elf , a man , and a dwarf have in the riddermark?
speak quickly !
give me your name , horsemaster , and i shall give you mine .
i would cut off your head , dwarf ... ... if it stood but a little higher from the ground .
you would die before your stroke fell !
i'm aragorn , son of arathorn .
this is gimli , son of gloin and legolas from the woodland realm
we are friends of rohan and of thoden , your king .
thoden no longer recognizes friend from foe .
not even his own kin .
saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this lands .
my company are those loyal to rohan .
and for that , we are banished .
the white wizard is cunning .
he walks here and there they say ... ... as an old man .
hooded and cloaked .
and everywhere his spies slip past our nets .
we are no spies .
we track a band of uruk hai westward across the plains .
they have taken two of our friends captive .
the uruks are destroyed .
we slaughtered them during the night .
but there were two hobbits .
do you see two hobbits with them?
they will be small .
only children to your eyes .
we left none alive .
we piled the carcasses and burned them .
they're dead?
i am sorry .
hasufel !
arod !
may these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters .
farewel .
look for your friends , but do not trust to hope .
it has forsaken these lands .
we ride north !
it's one of their little belts .
we failed them .
a hobbit lay here and the other .
they crawled .
their hands were bound .
their bonds were cut .
they ran over here ...
... and were followed .
the belt !
run !
tracks lead away from the battle ...
... into ...
fangorn forest .
fangorn?
what madness drew them there?
did we lose him?
i think we lost him .
i'm gonna rip off both your little heads !
come here !
trees !
climb a tree !
he's gone .
merry !
let's put a maggot hole in your belly .
run , merry !
little orcs !
it's talking merry . the tree is talking .
tree?
i am no tree !
i am an ent .
treeherder !
shepherd of the forest .
don't talk to it merry .
don't encourage it .
treebeard some call me .
and whose side are you on?
side?
i am on nobody's side ... ... because nobody is on my side , little orc .
nobody cares for the woods anymore ..
we're not orcs .
we're hobbits !
hobbits?
never heard of a hobbit before .
sounds like orc mischief to me !
they come with fire they come with axes .
biting , breaking , hacking , burning .
destroyers and usurpers curse them !
no !
you don't understand .
we are hobbits !
halflings !
shirefolk !
maybe you are ... ... and maybe you aren't
the white wizard will know .
white wizard?
saruman !
see , see !
we have led you out !
hurry , hurry !
very lucky we find you .
nice hobbit .
it's a bog !
he's led us into a swamp !
swamp , yes , yes !
come master .
we will take you to safe paths , through the mist .
come hobbits , come .
we move quickly !
i found it .
i did .
the way through the marshes .
orcs don't use it .
orcs don't know it
they go round for miles and miles .
come quickly .
swift and quick like shadows we must be .
there are dead things !
dead faces in the water !
all dead .
all rotten .
elves and men and orcs .
a great battle long ago .
the dead marshes .
yes , yes !
that is the name .
this way .
don't follow the lights .
careful now !
or hobbits go down to join the dead ones ... ... and light little candles of their own .
frodo !
gollum?
don't follow the lights !
gollum !
mr. frodo !
are you alright?
so bright , so beautiful .
ah precious .
what did you say?
master should be resting .
master need to keep up his strength .
who are you?
musn't ask us it's name not his business .
gollum , gollum .
gandalf told me you were one of the river folk .
call me heart and hand and bone .
and call every traveller far from home .
he said your life was was a sad story .
they do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead .
you were not so very different from a hobbit once ... ... were you?
smagol?
what did you call me?
that was your name once , wasn't it?
a long time ago .
my ...
my name
smagol .
black riders !
hide !
hide !
hide !
come on frodo , come on !
they will see us !
they will see us
i thought they were dead !
dead?
no , you cannot kill them .
no .
wraiths !
wraiths on wings !
they are calling for it
they are calling for the precious .
mr. frodo !
it's alright .
i'm here .
hurry , hobbits !
the black gate is very close .
orc blood !
these are strange tracks .
the air is so close here .
this forest is old .
very old .
full of memories ...
... and anger .
the trees are speaking to each other .
gimli !
lower your axe .
aragorn , something is out there !
what do you see?
the white wizard approaches .
do not let him speak .
he will out a spell on us !
we must be quick .
you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits .
where are they?
they passed this way the day before yesterday .
they met someone they did not expect .
does that comfort you?
who are you?
show yourself !
it cannot be !
you fell !
through fire .... ... and water .
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak ... ... i fought him , the balrog of morgoth .
until at last , i threw down my enemy ... ... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside .
darkness took me .... ... and i strayed out of thought and time .
stars wheeled overhead ... ... and every day was as long as a life age of the earth .
but it was not the end .
i felt life in me again .
i've been sent back ... ... until my task is done .
gandalf !
gandalf?
oh yes .
that was what they used to call me .
gandalf the grey .
that was my name .
gandalf !
i am gandalf the white now .
and i come back to you now ... ... at the turn of the tide .
one stage of the journey is over , another begins .
war has come to rohan .
we must ride to edoras with all speed .
that is one of the mearas ... ... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell .
shadowfax
he's the lord of all horses ... ... and he's been my friend through many dangers .
my home .
i sleep in the forest here .
the roots of the mountains .
i told gandalf i would keep you safe .
and safe is where i'll keep you .
the trees have gone wild and dangerous .
anger is in their hearts .
they will harm you if they can .
there are too few of us now .
too few of us that are left to manage them .
the black gate of mordor .
my old gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw this .
master says show him the way into mordor .
so good smagol does what master says so .
i did .
we cannot get past them .
look !
the gate , it's opening !
i can see a way down .
sam !
no !
master !
i do not ask you to come with me , sam .
i know , mr. frodo .
i doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there .
now !
no !
no !
no master !
they catch you !
they catch you .
don't take it to him .
he wants the precious .
always he's looking for it !
and the preciousss is wanting to go back to him .
but we musn't let him have it .
no !
there is another way .
more secret and dark way .
why haven't you spoke of this before?
because master did not ask !
he is up to something .
are you saying is another way into mordor?
yes .
there is a path ... ... and some stairs .
and then ... ... a tunnel .
he has led us this far , sam .
mr. frodo , no !
he's been true to his word .
no !
lead the way , smagol .
good smagol always help .
edoras and the golden hall of meduseld
here lives the king of rohan ... whose mind is overthrown ... and saruman's hold over king thoden is now very strong .
my lord , your son ... ... is dead
my lord?
uncle?
will you not go to him?
will you do nothing?
be careful what you say .
do not look for welcome here .
he must have died sometime in the night .
what a tragedy for the king ... ... to lose his only son and heir .
i understand his passing is hard to accept . especially now that your brother has deserted you .
leave me alone , you snake !
oh , but you are alone .
who knows what you have spoken to the darkness .
the bitter watches of the night ... ... when all your life seems to shrink .
the walls of your bower closing in about you
so fair .
so cold .
like a morning pale spring ... ... still clinging to winter's chill .
your words are poison .
this place is as cheerful as a graveyard .
i cannot allow you before thoden king so armed , gandalf grayhame .
by order of grima wormtongue .
your staff .
oh .
no , you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
my lord .
gandalf the grey is coming .
a herald of woe .
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late ... ... thoden king .
he is not welcome .
why should i welcome you ... ... gandalf , gandalf stormcrow?
a just question my lord .
late is the hour ... ... in which this conjurer chooses to appear .
lathspell spell i name him .
ill news is an ill guest .
be silent !
keep your forked tongue behind your teeth .
i have not pass trough dead to bandy a few words ... ... with a witless worm .
your staff .
i told you to take the wizard's staff !
thoden ... ... son of thengel ... ... too long have you sat in the shadows .
i would stay still , if i were you !
talk to me !
i will release you ... ... from the spell .
you have no powers here ... ... gandalf the grey
i shall draw you , saruman , as poison is drawn from a wound .
wait .
if i go , thoden dies .
you did not kill me ... ... you will not kill him .
rohan is mine !
