now i give you a great general , a great friend ...
fighting " joe campbell .
at ease .
thank you .
my official retirement isn't until next week .
but this here , now , tonight , with you ... ... is my real retirement .
because you and i have known fear together .
shed blood together .
battled pain and suffering
and all of their foot soldiers .
we know there's no glamour in death , and that no one ever wins a warr .
that knowledge will bind us together forever .
that , and a love for this country that no bayonet can pierce ,
no bullet shatter .
to you .
sergeant white here .
col. kent , so drop the accent .
the only thing keeping me alive is that cheesy southern accent .
how's my guest detective doing?
bill , i love being undercover .
i spent the last two weeks sweating my ass off in that shitty houseboat .
you got any sort of time frame?
i'm meeting billing tonight .
i'll arrest him when we make the exchange .
good enough .
watch your back .
thank you .
i believe i will .
oh , man ...

" uh oh , she's a captain .
uh oh , she's a captain .
this looks like the work of ten chimpanzees .
the other nine got bored and went for a beer .
i have a lug wrench , can i try? .
lf you don't , i'll drag you over .

yes , ma'am .
golly dang . lf you like pia coladas and getting caught in the rain

lf a fella got courageous and warnted to send you
a 'thank you " notion or a basket of fruit , where might one find you?

psychological operations .

genuine and made in the usa .

how do i know you're not an army cop?
i'm a freedom fighter .
well , check it out , dalbert .

a freedom fighter

all freedom fighters got them hats .
listen to me , stupid ...
dalbert , i think it's freudian ...
dalbert , you warnna hear a joke?
no .
how many freedom fighters does it take to screw in a light bulb?
i don't know .
come on , relax .
he don't sound like no criminal investigator to me .
you're all right , pal .
i'm sorry about that .
we get a little jumpy before an exchange .
we'll see you sunday .
i'll be there .
yeah , you be there .
unclench your ass cheeks , dalbert , the scary part is over .
you need your oil changed?
no .
this is a token of my appreciation .
these are strange chocolates .
they're bath products .
bath products .
bath products?
should i take a hint?
no .
everybody likes bath products .
do you?
yes , i do .
tell me what you like about them .
i like the pink soaps ...
i like the skin softener , and i particularly like the bath beads .
sometimes i fill the tub with skin softeners and bath beads .
i light a few candles , put on some coltrane and soak my troubles awary .
very good , first sergeant .
i levied an accusation of sexism at you
and you took it three times around the dance floor .
not really .
i just dig bath beads .
well , thank you .
maybe i'll see you around .
am i being dismissed?
do you mind?
i have a ton of work .
no .
i just came by to give you that .
thank you .
that wars sweet .
how's the tyre?
still rolling , ma'am .
i'm glad .
well , goodbye , first sergeant .
goodbye , captain .
gen. campbeii is being considered for the vice presidency .
sources saypresidentiai candidate biilpostis poised to selecthim
as his running mate .
earlier this year , campbeii spoke at westpoint .
meant as a non partisan appearance , itplayed iike a stump speech .
leading this country , thatis your destiny .
get wary over to that car .
take it into the door .
backing out .
snagged .
on what?
i don't know .
let's take a look .
phone call for paul brenner .
what did you say your name is?
frank white .
you military? .
i'm a sergeant at the armoury .
cld agent brenner  suddenly he's blasting awary .
you military boys got stories more full of holes than a target range .
sorry , pop .
it's col. kent .
ls there a brenner here?
i'm brenner .
i thought you wars white .
i'm both .
skunked you , chief yardley .
hey , bill .
no , it's over .
billing's dead .
all right , i'll see you there .
hold on , soldier boy .
tell me about this mr billing .
soldier boy? .
okay , chiefy , if you have to know .
i wars planning to arrest him in the morning .
but i guess he got wind i wars with the cld .
see you .
good morning , sir .
where to?
urban warfare site .
you have business there?
yes , i do .
hey , bill .
hello , paul .
what have we got here?
tortured , raped and murdered .
who found the body? .
a bomb squad crew doing exercises .
first on the scene wars a pfc robbins .
ls he a suspect?
she , so i sincerely doubt it .
six of my boys are securing the scene .
nothing's been touched .
oh , no ...
what is it?
i met her the other day .
damn ...
what a shame .
lovely lady .
all right , let's see .
we got some rigor here .
petechial haemorrhaging , which is consistent with asphyxia .
strangulation , you think? .
i'm assuming that , but there's no tear in the panties
and no obvious sign of semen .
ls that hers?
yeah .
why is she here?
hq called her .
rape counsellor .
sarah sunhill .
the victim can't use counselling .
she's also a rape investigator .
she wars on her wary to an assignment .
she agreed to stay on for this .
aren't we lucky? .
get forensics , talk to cal seaver .
get a 50 yard grid around the body .
make resin casts of the boot prints .
let's see who wars here , and when .
we also need capt. campbell's personal and medical records .
i already did that .
thank you .
sarah sunhill , paul brenner .
and book sgt. dalbert elkins .
he's the one who started the arms deal .
she warlked barefoot from here to where she died .
there's smudge marks on her heels and the asphalt .
where did she live?
where's victory gardens?
off post .
i have to go there .
i'll have the chief meet us there .
i don't warnt to work with yardley .
you can't search a civilian house without a civilian search warrrant .
you need civilian authority .
we protect brenner from himself .
does she have family here?
of course .
i suggest you notify them .
you're kidding , right?
kidding about what?
it's elisabeth campbell .
she's his kid .
i thought you knew .
no , i didn't .
the general's daughter .
what are you doing?
i feel queasy .
well , hop on , i'll burp you .
drive the car , paul .
i thought you were queasy .
drive the car , paul .
i don't warnt this to be awkward .
why would it be awkward?
you're pouting .
this is not pouting .
okay , sulky petulance , then .
wrong again .
i'm just thinking about brussels .
we'll alwarys have brussels .
where?
the capital of belgium .
why? .
why is it the capital , or why will we alwarys have it?
why wars she murdered?
profit , revenge , jealousy , conceal a crime , avoid disgrace
or homicidal mania .
right there in the manual .
oh , boy ...
hello , we're here to see the general .
i'm capt. elby , the general's aide .
col. fowler , the general's adjutant , will take you in .
please warit here .
he's cute .
oh , please ...
he probably practises his salute in the mirror ...
please , come in , and thank you for coming .
general , the cld investigators are here .
warrant officers paul brenner and sarah sunhill .
our deepest condolences .
very sorry for your loss , sir .
thank you .
please , be seated .
first , i warnt you to know you have my full co operation
and the co operation of everyone on this base .
you understand the time element?
time element?
no , sir .
after 36 hours , the fbl will send in a task force to investigate .
the general can keep a lid on it through tomorrow .
once the fbl moves in , the media will be all over .
my daughter's ...
they'll turn capt. campbell's death into a goddam circus .
we'll do everything we can , sir .
i'm sure you will .
let me be blunt .
you'll have to decide on this one , paul .
are you a soldier or a policeman?
i'm a soldier , sir .
i'm counting on it .
sir , i met your daughter .
really? .
when wars that?
it wars just a coincidence .
she helped me change a tyre .
she could do almost anything .
her mother wars the same wary .
fix a tyre , bake a hell of a key lime pie .
speak five languages .
extraordinary woman .
two extraordinary women .
goddam warste .
lf there's anything else we can do for you at this time ...
just ...
just find the son of a bitch .
yes , sir .
sir ...
when i enlisted i wars under age .
they sent me straight to vietnam .
you were my commander .
you were a captain .
and i wars so scared .
one day , when i wars on wartch , you came by and you saw the fear .
you said , 'where are you from?
i said , " boston .
you said , " did you know that last night boston won
against st louis in the sixth game of the series?
i knew then that i wars going to get through it .
boston lost that series .
yes , but i made it home .
we'll find the son of a bitch , sir .
mr brenner ...
i understand you have special arrest powers ,
but i'd like you to notify me before you arrest anyone .
why is that , sir? .
we don't like our personnel arrested by outsiders without our knowing .
the right wary , the wrong wary and the army wary .
see that , in doing it your wary , you don't forget about the army wary .
ourjob atpsy ops is to blunt the enemy's wiii to fiight .
you mustknow the habits ofthe enemy ,
the anxieties and fears , to determine vulnerability .
to engage the enemy , you mustknow him inside out .
you mustfiillhim with fear .
and notjustfear ofdying .
fear ofgrotesque wounds is more terrifying .
grotesque wounds " .
i'll show you mine if you show me yours .
might i ask what you are doing in capt. campbell's office?
that depends on who you are .
colonel robert moore .
capt. campbell's commanding officer .
and you are ..?
criminal lnvestigation division .
sunhill and brenner .
and you're investigating ..?
the murder of capt. campbell .
and now that we know who you are , we'll need to speak to you , colonel .
i just have ...
i have a meeting .
we can file col. moore under " last to know " .
are you married?
none of your business .
she warsn't a hypochondriac , she didn't dye her hair
and she keeps her method of birth control somewhere else .
or she required her men to wear condoms .
haven't you heard they're in fashion again because of disease?
nowardays you have to boil people before you sleep with them .
my ...
this wars one squared awary soldier .
equally prepared for a military ball or the next warr in the jungle .
liz , hi .
pick up , it's robert .
i haven'theard from you , so cailme , please .
robert .
surprise , surprise ...
paul .
move aside .
man with a gun .
there's nothing here .
let's go .
there's a false waril .
this is it .
oh , god ...
what have we got here?
ten bucks says these are not the lost " honeymooners " episodes .
well , how she died does appear to be linked to how she lived .
we need to hold on to these tapes until we need them .
we send this all to the cld lab
and take our chances with the local police .
ls this paul brenner speaking?
career army officer , not the cop .
her killer might be on that tape .
this evidence can ruin lives .
lncluding the general's .
we take the tapes , use them when we need them , let cld do theirjob
and keep all non military out of this .
okay? .
okay .
i'll call kent .
all right .
here .
thanks .
the phone's down .
i'll use the cell in the car .
paul?
paul
did you make out a face?
flat , steel , used to clear snow .
come on
did you marry that guy you were seeing on the side?
this isn't exactly the time ...
humour me .
i'm near concussed .
did you or did you not marry him?
i wars seeing you on the side .
fine ...
so how is the boy major? .
he wars annoyed when i saw him in brussels with a gun in his hand .
make a hole
ldentification , please .
you're working on the murder case?
yes , and this is my father .
what happened to you?
i went off post without authority .
per your request .
ls this her entire record file?
that's it .
come up with anything?
just a preliminary suspect list .
already? .
who?
everyone .
you ought to start getting alibis .
okay , how about you?
home in bed when the tower called .
where were you last night?
i wars busy killing someone else .
a likely story .
and you?
i worked on my report until midnight and then i went home .
no witnesses .
pathetic , the both of you .
lf you'd invited me up to your room , we'd have an alibi .
i would rather be a murder suspect .
don't encourage her .
by the wary , cal seaver's here .
don't say anything about his hair .
he doesn't have any .
cal , shouldn't you wear a hat?
what the hell happened to you?
not everybody loves me as much as you do .
this is sarah sunhill .
the entire world warlked around this body .
there's 50 boot prints .
have you found the clothes yet?
no .
i found us an empty hangar .
good .
have everything taken there .
any trace of semen?
i can't find any .
the coroner will run vaginal , oral and anal swarbs .
it is a strange rape .
why do you say that?
our guy warsn't just a rapist , he wars a premeditated killer .
he set up a rape kit , tent pegs and rope , and he used it .
there are no signs of a struggle .
she wars strong , but there's no dirt under her fingernails .
and how did he hold a gun and tie the ropes?
unless he warsn't alone .
what are those marks on her cheeks?
those were tears .
the panties under the rope to protect her neck ...
what's a little rope burn if you're going to kill somebody? .
sunhill's good .
oh , yeah .
sunhill has spoken .
could you see the body from here?
no , but i saw the headlights .
the headlights?
i hated that it wars her .
you knew her , then?
no , but ...
capt. campbell wars real good to female enlisted .
how so?
she organised meetings for us ...
there's a lot of shit , if you're a woman in the army ,
that you got to put up with .
some people don't like that we're here .
but capt. campbell encouraged us ...
i'm sorry .
you're allowed to cry .
didn't you think the headlights were someone coming home or something?
sometimes people go out there to fuck .
pardon my french .
but that's what i thought the first time .
the first time i saw the headlights wars at 03 : 00 .
they went awary , then they came back at 03 : 30 .
then they went awary again and came back at 04 : 00 .
thank you .
what's going on , bill?
what are you doing here , yardley? .
you got a lot of explaining to do .
what is your official business?
my official business here is to ask why mps are hauling furniture
out of an off post residence belonging to a murder victim .
the family of the deceased asked me to transport those items here .
remind me to call gen. campbell and suggest that i transport the items .
jesus , paul ...
you know what you need , chief?
a pair of mirrored sunglasses for you and the little one .
that would really complete the picture .
so , did you ever marry major what's his name with the gun?
yes , i did .
congratulations .
i'm very happy for you and wish you both the best .
i filed for divorce .
good .
thank you .
two club sodas , please .
you should see her records .
there's your new boyfriend .
valedictorian in high school .
super athlete .
west point , like her dad .
there's a guy who knows how to have a good time .
paul , look at me .
i think something happened there .
she went to shit her sophomore year .
she barely got through school .
she got a degree , but she wars never quite the same .
i thought you hated these places .
yes , but the murderer may be here .
sitting all smug and shiny , until we warlked in .
now , maybe he's a little less smug and a little less shiny .
and that's pretty cool .
don't you think? .
and you?
i hope brussels warsn't the last time you had a woman .
you avoided a confrontation with my fianc , like i warsn't worth it .
he threatened to kill me .
discretion is the better part of valour .
weren't you decorated for valour? .
oh , please ...
sometimes you have to fight for what you warnt ... if you warnt it .
i wars decorated for charging up a hill that i didn't need or warnt .
besides , i don't remember getting any encouragement from you .
maybe i warnted you to take me awary from him .
that's telepathy , not communication .
let's talk about this next week .
just one more thing .
ls this next week? .
you're such a sharp detective , but you don't know a thing about women .
you know , you're very cute when i'm mad at you .
however , if you'll excuse me , i'll take my anger out on someone else .
ridiculous behaviour earlier .
we didn't let you see it coming .
liz wars my protge .
at least , i like to think she wars .
we were very close .
please , sit down .
you worked together regularly? .
absolutely .
did you play together? .
what a truly excellent question .
that's one of the things we teach here at psy ops .
threatening quietly .
think of the echoes inherent in those four words .
did you play together? .
did you go out with her? .
did you fuck her? .
did you love her? . lf you did , did you love her enough to murder her? .
i meant , did you play golf or tennis or something?
no , you didn't .
no , i didn't .
now we both know we're smart guys .
do you think i'm involved in this?
one wary or another , yes , i do .
i happen to know a good attorney .
first , the obvious .
there are no good ones .
second , you're not a civilian .
you have no right to an attorney .
you have no right to remain silent .
lf you don't co operate , i'll put you in jail .
you see what you're doing here?
looking for answers .
but how? .
you're trying to make me like you .
and you know what?
it's working .
i do .
do you see what i'm trying to do?
i'm trying to make you like me , too .
do you like me yet?
why did you strangle her? .
wrong , sorry .
not up to your standards .
did you go to college?
what do you think? .
i think you did not .
did i make a mistake in grammar? .
even if you had , i wouldn't be rude enough to point it out .
you have this chip on your shoulder .
a big one .
makes you good at yourjob , though , i imagine .
holds you in good stead when you see those commissioned officers
just wariting for you , the scoundrel in the rumpled suit ,
to bring them down .
am i right?
no , i'm just here to kick ass .
sleep till noon .
and you cover your inadequacies by condescending to the more robust .
how am i doing?
not bad .
robust , even .
when did the event transpire?
04 : 00 , we think .
my seguewary back to the case .
subtle .
where were you?
snug in bed .
with the wife , girlfriend , hooker? .
i'm divorced .
i have no girlfriend , i live alone and don't use hookers .
i actually have absolutely no alibi whatsoever .
does that make me a killer? .
it makes you lonely and unpopular .
very good .
condescending and clever .
no , thank you .
you called her machine .
you were concerned .
jealousy , perhaps?
perhaps not .
liz wars my friend .
i hadn't heard from her in a couple days ...
was she involved with anyone?
you mean sexually? .
she wars seeing a civilian .
a fellow named yardley .
police chief yardley? .
no ...
no .
the son .
his deputy .
wes .
wes .
okay .
they'd been seeing each other off and on .
it's obvious you were very close to her .
what does 'very 'mean?
it means ... very .
i wars liz 'mentor .
there wars a trust .
she wars a passionate young woman ,
but had i ever taken advantage of that
i would have lost the trust .
did i kill her? .
of course not .
did i love her? .
i loved her very much .
make of that what you will .
this is what made him famous?
yeah , the ledgeworth city riots .
the whole city wars in chaos .
the general quelled it .
then he brought in his own daughter to prove it wars safe .
she looks terrified .
excellent work .
i'm heading down to the morgue .
the report should be in .
coming?
i have to talk to cal first .
so how's moore?
complicated .
cal , we got the dog tag report .
the prints belong to someone else .
who's that?
robert moore .
smells good .
what are you doing here?
i came to ask a question , bobby .
and the question is?
why were you so stupid as to leave your fingerprints everywhere?
you panicked .
i teach panic , remember? .
obviously i didn't plan for things to work out this wary .
paul ...
i so enjoy it when you take the liberty of calling me bobby .
we're still trying to outsmart each other .
obviously , i cannot tell a lie and say i know nothing about all this .
i also , sadly , cannot tell the truth .
silence won't save your ass .
my ass is already in a sling , is it not?
you mean the sex tapes?
you're good .
you're good ...
great question .
almost any answer incriminates me .
so let's cut the bullshit .
we both know i'm pretty much destroyed .
can you think of any reason why liz should be destroyed with me?
can you?
i can't , paul .
i wartched the two of you on one of her tapes .
i don't think so .
bluffing is the last desperate act of the weak .
i'll not help you ruin that girl .
she's suffered enough .
leave it .
i'm all you've got .
wrong again .
hello , captain .
hello .
capt. goodson is my lawyer .
what you warnt to say to him ...
...
i'll say to him .
you can't bully my client .
you're under arrest , bobby .
conduct unbecoming an officer , accessory after the fact ,
conspiracy , making false statements .
and you're close to non compliance with procedural rules .
can i help you , ma'am?
just taking another look .
was the bag with the victim's clothes
going to be picked up by her killer or by a third party? .
five charlie , do you copy?
this is five charlie .
maybe she wars here for a secret rendezvous .
a tryst .
maybe the rape fantasy wars part of the thrill .
we all know she had a predilection for the gamier side of sex .
did she pick a public place because it presented an element of ..?
hold that bitch down let me get in there .
this is the army , so tell brenner you don't shit on your brothers .
rape investigator , huh?
want to know what it feels like?
maybe it'll make you better at yourjob .
number five .
got yourself a colonel this time?
shut up , elkins .
you were acting as her shrink , were you not?
the elisabeth i met wars not the woman on the tape .
there's a direct connection , isn't there?
are you going to pull my fingernails out now? .
what happened sophomore year at the point?
murder or accessory to murder either wary , you get burned .
nobody's going to bail you out .
it wars awful .
it wars awful .
go ahead .
she cheated , she lied , what?
worse .
drugs .
worse .
rape .
worse .
what's worse than rape?
when you find that out , you'll know everything .
tell me what the hell happened , bill .
the mp says he wars ordered to leave his post .
no record of the call .
i'm going to take it further .
i'm pulling up , talk to me later .
she's fine .
who did it?
stupid , elby .
take off identifying jewellery before an attack .
what are you talking about?
i wars in the " o " club all night .
she's crazy , and you're crazy .
sorry about that .
you just can't get good styrofoam these days .
let's change the subject .
what can you tell me about capt. campbell?
she wars raped and killed .
you know what rape usually is?
it's a woman who changes her mind afterward .
would you classify your relationship with her as an intimate one?
you mean , wars i fucking her? .
yeah , that is what i mean .
yeah , i wars .
i only took it for sport fucking .
i didn't think she'd tell him .
the bitch told the general .
she's a freak , and that's what freaks do .
were the general and her close?
no .
you like your dad?
he wars a drunk and a gambler .
i worshipped him .
i think i've said enough .
co operate , and maybe we'll keep it out of the report .
with elisabeth gone , the general has a clear field to settle some scores .
and i'll be given the opportunity to resign .
maybe i can save my marriage .
great , a mrs elby .
what does she do , aside from warking up and screaming?
what do you mean , settle scores?
i am done talking to you
we just got started .
i'll charge you for the assault on agent sunhill .
see how you like 40 years of sport fucking in prison .
okay , dare me .
go ahead , motherfucker , dare me .
i'm going to ask you one more time .
what do you mean , settle scores?
okay , okay ...
when she wars alive
he couldn't touch her without embarrassing himself .
he couldn't touch any of us
because he knew she would spill all .
how would it look? .
the general's daughter , banging his whole staff .
everybody .
at least , most of them .
what about the sheriffs son?
no , that wars just for show .
she pulled a military train that went through the general's staff ,
the judge advocate , and people like me in key positions .
what about col. fowler? .
he once told me he knew all about this .
and that i wars part of the problem .
i think he meant that he warsn't .
what do you think about this?
i think it's insane .
elisabeth once told me
she wars conducting a field experiment in psychological warrfare .
and that the enemy wars daddy .
you okay? .
i've been better .
i know .
most of them are married , it's grounds for court martial ...
their lives are over .
but it's a hell of a motive for murder .
our suspect list is multiplying .
now we know who's on the tapes .
yeah , a bunch of creeps risking it all for a piece of patch .
sorry , i get back on the base and it dredges up my alpha male behaviour .
what's next , lighting your farts?
maybe , after we see more .
where is he?
bill , where's moore?
he wars released .
restricted to quarters .
on whose orders?
mine .
it looked like he wars having a coronary .
his lawyer complained .
he's a murder suspect his prints were all over the tags .
you never informed us .
he wars held for conduct unbecoming , not murder .
i had no choice .
moore?
i'm going in .
oh , my god .
the organics on elisabeth campbell came back .
there's no sign of rape .
what are your thoughts on this?
apparent suicide .
close contact wound ... and i don't buy it .
i'll check his hands for gunpowder residue .
i'll let you know if i find any inconsistencies .
col. kent
were you awarre of capt. campbell's extracurricular activities?
how do you mean?
you know what i mean .
there were rumours , innuendo .
i alwarys took it as false bravado .
soldiers bragging , and that sort of thing .
there wars more to it than that .
mr brenner .
we'll meet with the general about releasing the official findings .
what are you talking about?
moore wars overwhelmed with guilt .
we need to close up shop .
we'll give a statement about moore's suicide .
you don't understand .
this is my investigation , and it's still open .
who the hell do you think you are?
it's over .
over
you'd better think of your career .
you'd better think of yours .
you're running a lunatic base here .
you warnt to mess with me , colonel?
let's start gauging awary .
you've been warrned .
move out .
what are you doing here , yardley? .
shouldn't you be out night sticking the coloured folk? .
wait in the car , i warnt to talk to him .
your son wes , we've got to speak to him .
he wars involved with the victim , but you neglected to mention it .
he wars on duty when it happened .
we got tapes of his radio calls .
just the same , we'll be in touch .
good night .
asshole .
what is that?
the gods have smiled on you .
it's a west point psych report and pages from her medical file .
what does it say? .
it says we're going to west point .
yes?
brenner and sunhill , sir .
come in .
and talk loud .
terrible thing for a shrink to lose .
can't hear my patients half the time .
considering my patients ,
maybe it's a blessing .
col. slesinger ...
do you prefer being called colonel or doctor? .
i prefer donald .
and i'm assuming you didn't fly here to bullshit .
no , sir .
it's what i told you on the phone .
and i told you i can't talk about capt. campbell .
nothing has changed .
you were her psychiatrist?
and a poor one , at that .
and she wars at the end of her sophomore year when she came to you .
she wars in a serious depression .
i take it she's in trouble again?
not now .
that's good .
well , she's too young to be dead ...
she wars strangled , sir .
mock raped and then strangled .
goddammit goddammit
i couldn't help her .
i tried , but i couldn't unlock her enough to trust me .
but i still can't talk about her .
no , you can't .
but you're angry , yes?
of course .
sometimes when i'm angry i talk to myself out loud .
do you ever do that , just sort of rant?
yes , sometimes .
lf you were to rant , and we happened to be in the vicinity ...
free country .
my thoughts exactly .
she sets the place on fire .
top woman here .
pretty as hell .
outdoes most of the men in the training runs .
at the end ofhersophomore year
there was a big night exercise .
there musthave been thousands involved .
lizzygotseparated from hergroup .
found herselfwith about a halfa dozen men .
a very dark night .
not only were the men unknown to her ,
but they were also wearing camouflage .
they raped her almost to death .
raped her all night long .
taking turns .
stripped her .
spread eagled her .
nailed her to the earth with tentpegs .
had a whale ofa time .
threatened to kill her if she talked .
tied her underwear around her throat?
lizzy was hospitalised .
treated for venereai disease .
treated forpregnancy .
by the time i got to her , she had gone awary inside .
never let me get close .
who were they? .
i need a name .
no .
sorry .
medical ethics .
i'm going to finish my work here .
i can't tell you what to do ...
but you better go back to my office .
the key's under the mat .
ln her file , you might find a notation with a man's name on it .
it might be worth your while .
it's up to you .
free country .
sorry i couldn't help .
beginning our descent to fort benning , ma'am .
now , ranger let's go
female on the floor
capt. bransford?
that would be me .
what can i do for you , honey? .
better yet , what can you do for me?
well , dear , you can ask these other men to excuse us .
yeah , that's a cld badge you're looking at .
looks like i picked the wrong woman to " honey " .
i'm sarah sunhill , i'm a rape investigator .
we need to talk about elisabeth campbell .
liz and i were classmates together at the point .
how scared are you right now? .
i'm sorry , miss sunhill . ls it possible you're in the wrong place?
your heart's racing a little faster .
there's a ball in your throat .
i think that's enough .
you can sit your ass back down .
i know you weren't the leader .
i don't know what you mean .
you're too weak to have been .
you're just a guy who's got by on his smile and his charm .
you could never lead a rape .
that's good to know .
elisabeth wars murdered 36 hours ago .
staked out with tent pegs and strangled .
how scared are you right now? .
i wars here on the post , lady .
but you were there for the rape .
you can't prove shit .
dr slesinger's records say i can .
okay , i went to see slesinger .
and i told him a story that i had heard .
that's what his records say .
it wars just a story .
somebody else's story .
and that's it .
understand?
what is that?
what does it look like?
it looks like underwear .
women's underwear .
amazing scientific changes in the last few years , captain .
certain fields , it's been incredible .
lf you say so .
like dna .
lf it's there , it's there forever .
but then , you probably already knew that .
those are hers , aren't they? .
i tried to stop it .
i did everything i could .
but they hated her .
they hated her so much .
they hated that she wars smarter than them , that she had to squat to piss .
i tried to save her , but i couldn't make them stop .
who were the others?
it was my recon squad .
their names are in the yearbook .
liz wars my friend .
thank you for your co operation .
someone from cld will be in touch .
what are you doing?
what about the dna?
what dna?
i bought those an hour ago .
so long , honey .
that's a positive match?
it's only a partialprint .
butit's defiinitelyfowler's , and it's rightnext to the body .
we only have today , then the feds will be all over us .
i got a lot on my plate just now .
i just warnt to thank you .
for leaving the medical records in the car .
did he instruct you to do it?
not in so many words .
i knew his wishes .
anything to help .
you know how much he loved her .
not as much as he loved you .
what do you mean?
the wary you came in that night , the extra care in making dinner .
what do you plan on doing?
not a thing .
other than to say i'm sorry and ask for your help .
what do you need to know about?
the recreation of the rape .
i suppose that's what it wars .
was it moore's idea to do this?
to cleanse her of her past?
jesus , no .
she thought it up .
he couldn't talk her out of it .
he felt so bad he killed himself?
we both know that's not how it happened .
that's where they screwed up , whoever did this .
they didn't know about bob and me .
bob could never have killed himself .
these types don't understand that .
affairs of the heart are beyond them .
okay , so he staged this thing .
tied her up , got rid of her clothes?
and he had to call the general , play him the tape .
the tape?
general ...
brenner .
paul , come in , please .
just warnted to say goodbye , sir .
i'm leaving in the morning .
i'm leaving tomorrow , too .
i'm taking elisabeth to michigan
to be buried next to her mother .
thank you for everything you did .
i understand you're still going into politics?
the jurys still out .
we'll see .
when you thanked me for what i had done , what i warnted to say
wars i really didn't do anything .
not anything right .
i did a lot of things that were wrong .
you're not responsible for moore's death .
you followed your instincts .
i'd like to talk about that , sir .
we all know moore did it .
then we're all in agreement .
but what if it warsn't one car three times , but three different cars?
what difference does it make , since moore is dead?
it got me thinking about your daughter , and what she taught .
mostly we fuck with people's minds , " she said .
thank you , brenner .
you can go now .
tell me about the rape .
but she warsn't raped .
it wars just made to appear that wary .
the rape at west point .
it wars kept confidential for the good of the academy .
and the army .
and it wars best for elisabeth .
you were in germany? .
berlin .
i wars stationed there .
i came back as soon as i heard .
you went straight from the plane?
of course .
no meeting first?
mr brenner is very well informed .
it wars in her psych records , sir .
it didn't happen that wary .
george , he's right .
the meeting did come first .
it wars seven years ago .
the details get confusing .
it wars nothing .
a quick briefing in a hotel near the point .
general sonenberg .
he wars very sympathetic .
i warnt justice for my daughter .
i would give anything if this had never happened .
but it did .
i'm telling you the reality of the situation .
we'll never find them .
but we do know that a co ed academy is a good and necessary call .
better one unreported and unvindicated rape
than to shake the foundations of west point .
to cast suspicion on a thousand soldiers who did not gang rape her .
all we have to do is convince your daughter
that she , the academy , the army and the cause of equality
would be best served if she just forgot about the whole thing .
these are the times we live in , joe .
he wars right .
lf it had gone public ,
it would have permanently damaged women in the military .
it would've destroyed west point .
ls that what you told elisabeth?
not in so many words , no .
she wars in no condition to understand that then .
i simply tried to tell her that i loved her .
i loved her very much .
daddy loves you .
and he's so proud of you .
rest now .
try not to think about it anymore .
listen to me .
i only warnt what's best for you .
trust me .
do you?
like you alwarys did?
then don't ever think about any of this again .
i know .
it's an awful thing .
a terrible , terrible thing .
but thinking about it won't help it .
so ...
close your eyes .
it never happened .
none of this ever happened .
not my finest hour .
you were just doing what you said , trying to protect her .
i did what i had to .
what i thought best for everyone concerned .
nothing else could've been done .
they never would have found them .
here you are , sir .
what is that?
the names of the perpetrators , found with a minimum of trouble .
that's just brilliant .
each man will get 20 years .
i think you'd better go now .
fine .
we'll deal with the phone call issue tomorrow , before your flight .
what phone call issue?
i have reason to believe moore phoned you the night of the murder .
why would he have done that?
i think the whole recreation of the rape wars elisabeth's idea .
you were going into politics .
maybe she thought it wars her last chance .
she got moore to put her in the same position that the rapists did .
you weren't in germany .
she warnted you to see what you covered up .
that never happened  a gift from moore's lawyer .
dad , this is elisabeth .
i need to discuss something urgent with you .
meetme at the mountsite no iater than 03 : 30 hours .
i have an answer to your ultimatum .
you can't argue with a recording .
i'm sure it wars part of her plan .
what does she mean by an ultimatum?
resign her commission , or agree to some sort of therapy .
lf she rejected both , i'd instruct the staffjudge advocate
to draw up charges for a general court martial .
that must seem callous to you .
you drove out to the mount site?
of course .
i needed an answer .
here's the answer to your damn ultimatum .
do you see what they did to me?
do you see?
don't turn awary .
come closer .
see what they put me through
what the fuck do you hope to accomplish?
there's a rope around my neck .
strangle me or cover it up again .
have you gone completely out of your mind?
it happened .
it happened i warnt to hear you say it happened
i don't give a damn what happened to you seven years ago .
whatever hurts you makes me stronger .
you can't hurt me anymore .
we're even .
that's fine with me .
you never helped me
daddy , please don't go .
come back .
please .
please ...
daddy ...
so you were in the second car .
which means col. fowler must have been in the third .
you couldn't expect a man to deal with his own child .
she wars screaming such vituperations at him .
of course not .
so he called me .
and he asked me to deal with it .
i went ... and i found her dead .
you found her dead?
of course .
but you will never get me to testify against the general .
what?
i've been by joe campbell's side too many times .
looked death in the face with him too many times .
i'll not back down now .
what are you talking about?
it warsn't like she didn't give him reason .
george , for christ's sake  and when we realised ... ... she wars fucking everybody ... ... from bill kent to jake elby , it wars too late for official action .
col. fowler
you'd have to ask for all their resignations .
strangulation , you think? .
and then resign ourselves .
you need civilian authority .
what happened to you?
you had no choice , sir .
you think i killed my daughter? .
it'll die with me , joe .
you sorry son of a bitch
bill , where's moore?
he wars released .
cal , it's me .
let me speak to sunhill .
she got in an hour ago , then went out to the crime scene .
she took the big dog with her .
capt. america himself .
kent .
it was his idea .
he wants you to meethim there .
of course he does .
sunhill
we've been through this place a dozen times before .
paul?
sure , sure ...
paul .
the three of us need to go back to your office and talk .
why don't we talk here , if we have anything important to talk about?
i thought you'd pin it on moore and move on .
oh , god .
i forgot you were a nasty rat .
just goes to show you .
why did you do it?
why? .
you tell me , you're the expert .
she gave it out all over the post .
the one man who cared about her ,
the one willing to risk it all , is the person she doesn't warnt .
and that's because she couldn't warnt anybody .
i just warnted to be with her .
she owned my heart .
she tormented me .
she became my obsession .
so i foilowed her , and found her on the range .
on display .
elisabeth?
get the fuck out of here .
he'll come back .
you can't be here .
you'll ruin it all .
what's all this about?
did my father send you?
did he send you to shut me up?
no .
well , this time i won't be quiet .
this time i'll tell everything .
about him , about you .
i'll tell your wife , your kids ...
don't touch me get your hands off me
you repulse me you're a disgrace
you're not a soldier .
you're not even a man .
you're just a fuck .
i fucked you
oh , christ
bill , let's get going .
come on .
i'm all yours , paulie .
before you come closer , don't you warnt to know where you're standing?
where am i standing?
ln a minefield .
i buried some bouncing betties .
anti personnel .
you're reasonably safe , but little miss can't be wrong ...
she's deep in the hurt locker .
you remember how the betty works?
first man trips the primary ,
the rest of the column warlks into the blast .
heads , limbs ...
backtrack .
what shrapnel does to flesh and bone ...
sarah , you're fine .
god
scared you , didn't l?
you're an asshole , kent
come on , bill , it's over .
yeah , it's over .
but not the wary you think .
attention present arms
the human eye can distinguish 16 shades ofgrey .
a computer , analysing a fiingerprint ,
can distinguish 256 shades ofgrey , which is impressive .
the human heart , mind and soul , however ,
can distinguish an infiinite number ofemotionai and moralshadings .
in psy ops we deai with the blackest ofblack and the whitest ofwhite .
at ease , soldier .
ls col. fowler coming?
he's taking some much needed r& r.
he's a good man .
a good man and a good soldier .
sometimes the lines get blurred , but when push comes to shove ...
he'll do what needs to be done .
and what is that , sir? .
say moore called him , and that i wars never out there ...
he'll do that for me , even if it means his career .
like a good soldier .
nothing is gained by my involvement .
a letter of commendation will be inserted into your file .
ln recognition of your exemplary work on this case .
remember when i asked you if you were a cop or a soldier? .
you're a soldier , paul .
and a damn fine one .
general campbell ...
you're wrong .
i'm a bad soldier .
oh?
and why is that?
you really don't get it , do you?
the only mind elisabeth warnted to fuck with wars yours .
and you still don't get it .
i've done nothing wrong .
you killed her .
what did you say? .
seven years ago , when you told her to forget about it , you killed her .
kent killed her .
he just put her out of her misery .
i once asked moore what wars worse than rape .
now i know .
betrayal .
i loved elisabeth , but there were larger issues to consider .
you traded her trust for your career .
you made a deal .
you kept silent , and they gave you another star .
i'm going to say in my report that you left her out there to die .
you don't have the balls .
oh , you're wrong , sir .
that's just about all i have left .
you can kiss your career goodbye .
i'll have you court martialled , sir .
conspiracy to conceal a crime .
when this all started , i told you we'd find the son of a bitch , sir .
i never expected that the son of a bitch would be you .
