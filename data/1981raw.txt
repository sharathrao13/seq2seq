on this beach called america ... ... there are 211 million grains of sand ... ... three billion on the beach we call earth .
if i am lucky ...
... the action that i am about to take ... ... will show the powerful ... ... that even ... ... the least grain of sand ... ... has in him ... ... the power to destroy them .

and a harvest gold .
and an avocado .

you smell something?
i do .
i smell success .
and you've got the odor .
all right , sam .
why do i say that to you , sam?
well , i certainly am trying .
got nothing to do with trying .
i\ x9ds believing .
when you believe in what you're selling , you succeed .
because then you're not selling .
you see what i'm saying?
you're talking from somewhere here .
you've got to believe .
i\ x9ds a gift .
i've got it .
marty's got it .
you may have it .
i can believe in anything .
isn't that right , marty?
i\ x9ds true .
you want to know who the greatest salesman in the world is?
that man , right there .
he sold the whole country , 200 million people ... ... on himself .
twice .
and what was nixon's sales pitch in '68?
in '68 , it was ...
he said he would end the war .
he would get us out of vietnam .
and what did he do?
he sent another 100, 000 troops ... ... and then he bombed the living shit out of them .
tha\ x9ds what he did .
now , what did nixon run on last year?
ending the war in vietnam .
and he won .
by a landslide .
that is a salesman .
he made a promise .
he didn't deliver .
and then he sold us on the same exact promise .
all over again .
tha\ x9ds believing in yourself .
these are for you .
read them .
these , you listen to .
while you're driving .
while you're shaving .
while you're taking a shit in the morning .
you gotta believe , sam .
this book right here will really teach you to believe in yourself .
this book right here will really teach you techniques .
these will make you a salesman .
i guarantee it .
the salesman who believes is the salesman who receives .
remember , power is a state of mind .
you have as much as you think you have .
if you don't think you have any , you don't .
talk about yourself as you see yourself .
and someday that will be yourself .
the salesman must see himself as a winner .
the salesman who believes is the salesman who receives .
for crying out loud .

volume on the new york stock exchange was 16, 500, 000 shares .
what happened , mr. bernstein , to the land of plenty?
when there's plenty for the few , and nothing for the plenty?
is that the american dream?
now remember , the customer's weapon is money .
tha\ x9ds what he'll want to talk about .
your weapon is quality .
tha\ x9ds what you'll insist on talking about .
don't get caught in the price game .
you tell him how great it is .
how much?
this is a very high quality desk .
this one is 38 inches .
how much is it?
this is $529 .
i really believe in this desk .
i want to show you something .
this is ...
i\ x9ds all right .
i know pretty much what to look for in a desk .
sam , i'm gonna be buying a lot of stuff ... ... and i'm just wondering , wha\ x9ds your best price?
i'll see what i can do for you .
all right .
give it your best shot .
i'll do that .
okey dokey .
what i can do is i can give you 10 % off that desk , which is $476 .
jesus !
sam , tha\ x9ds it?
tha\ x9ds your best price?
i\ x9ds our selection of the month .
excuse me .
can i see you in my office for a minute please , sam?
yes , i'll be right ...
i'll be right with you .
what are you doing?
are you out of your fucking mind?
offering 10 %?
are you trying to give this stuff away?
you said ...
i\ x9ds already been marked down .
for chris\ x9ds sake , tha\ x9ds less than we paid for the damn thing .
you know i think there's been a misunderstanding ...
i'm not interested in what you think .
i'm interested in what you're gonna do about it .
i guess i could tell him ...
you can't tell him shit .
you've made the offer .
tha\ x9ds it .
go out and hope he doesn't take it .
all right , mr. jones .
sir , can i show you some of our other very nice ...
all right , then .
yes .
you looked like you're gonna shit your pants .
you're on the board .
you see him write that check?
he did it to me , we do it to you .
fifty fifty all right with you?
sure .
good job , sam .
i\ x9ds not lying .
i\ x9ds business .
but i\ x9ds not right .
i should have said something on the spot .
no , you shouldn't have .
what are you saying , that i should swallow something like that?
it makes me sad that you would accept something , of all people .
sam , i'm just saying i\ x9ds not that big a deal .
it is a big deal .
bonny , if we're going to be partners ... ... we have to get this kind of thing straight .
sam , i get it .
okay?
i've been there .
but this guy's your boss .
if he wants to be an asshole , you might just have to let him do .
but , bonny ...
there's no " but , " sam .
what about my rights?
you've got a right to be mad , sure .
exactly .
tha\ x9ds what i'm saying , partner .
tha\ x9ds all i'm saying .
sam , i\ x9ds a job .
this is what i mean .
a man doesn't give up his rights at a job .
a man doesn't give up his rights anywhere .
you of all people should know that .
what should i know?
'cause i'm black , i should mouth off to my boss?
all this rights shit .
rights this , rights that .
rights , my ass .
i\ x9ds a job .
you got a right to pay your bills , pay for your kids .
i'm just saying you can't keep quitting jobs .
we all gotta work somehow .
come on .
you're a salesman , right?
like you do .
explain this to me , mr. bernstein .
all i want is a little piece of the american dream .
like my father and his father .
is that too much to expect?
hey , tuffer .
hey , boy .
you miss me , don't you?
of course you miss me .
this is a good country , maestro .
filled with good people .
but what good is good ... ... in times like these?
i've been trying to call .
double scotch , scotch and soda , double bourbon .
i\ x9ds not a good time , sam .
oh , no .
i know .
i just came to say hi .
you want to see a menu?
yes , please .
here you go .
i'll be right back .
thank you .
... great change , at the same time .
one change is defense spending is on the way down now .
for the first time in 20 years , the federal government is spending more ...
tha\ x9ds too much salt .
i know .
sorry .
how is it?
it is good .
remember sam jr .
used to call these " mashapotos "?
tha\ x9ds right .
is everything okay at work?
top of the charts .
top of the sales board .
i'm doing very well .
tha\ x9ds great .
maybe i'll be driving a cadillac soon .
he was a friend of yours?
who?
the one with the cadillac .
i drove by last night .
jesus , are you spying on me?
no .
what you doing lurking around the house for?
i wasn't lurking , marie .
i just ...
you told me to call .
i called and nobody answered , so ...
i said , try me , okay?
you know what?
i don't want to talk about this .
i respect that .
i just want you to know i'm not seeing anyone .
okay , tha\ x9ds your business .
i\ x9ds important to me that you know that .
fine .
now i know .
table four wants their check .
i'm sorry .
okay?
i didn't mean ...
can i call you later?
look , if i get off at a decent hour , i'll call you .
all right?
all right .
mr. bernstein , sir , there are people who sit and wait their lives away ... ... on the promise of a dream that will not come .
they are the sheep .
we have a great deal to be thankful for as americans tonight .
you've chosen el dorado , with front wheel drive .
i\ x9ds our most ...
but there are also many more like us , maestro ... ... who will not be pushed around .
the time has come when the masses ... ... have been pushed to the wall .
when they cannot any longer address their grievances through the legal ... ... political machinery of this country .
we're not the decision makers , the masses are .
if they think i\ x9ds time to overthrow the system , there's nothing you ... ... or anyone else can do .
hi .
i'm sam bicke .
harold .
how are you?
yeah .
are you with the police?
i'm not police .
i'm sam bicke .
yeah , i got that .
what can i do for you?
as a matter of fact ...
i've seen you on television .
i mean , the panthers on television ... ... and i'm in complete agreement with your stand .
except that i'm white .
we've all got to be born something .
do you know what that means?
it means you're not getting to your whole audience .
i mean , i'm white , but i'm in the same boat .
you own the boat .
no , i don't own the boat .
i'm not the man in the cadillac .
tha\ x9ds not me .
may i?
harold .
yes .
i feel like i can talk to you .
i sort of knew it would be like that .
i know what i\ x9ds like to not be respected , and be lied to ... ... and be treated like a great , big nothing .
and i want to do something .
you want to do something?
like the black panthers , i want to do something ...
the system is not right .
i have to go , but i want to throw an idea at you .
zebras .
zebras?
see , they're black and they're white .
the black panthers become the zebras ... ... and membership will double .
i don't want you to answer me right now .
just think about it .
this is $107 .
i wanted to feel like i was starting to do something .
sam .
i\ x9ds a great start .
take a look .
you see what i see?
wha\ x9ds that?
you're familiar with carnegie , right?
i gave it to you .
dale carnegie .
how to win friends and influence people .
oh , yes .
i know the book .
no , you don't .
you've seen the book .
maybe browsed through it .
but you don't know the book .
if you knew the book , you'd know what i mean when i say ...
always give a dog a good name .
always give a dog a name .
a good name .
damn it .
you've really got to listen better .
you're right .
i'm sorry .
i\ x9ds a carnegie technique for dealing with people .
when somebody's performance isn't good , you don't criticize them .
you don't say , " your work's shit .
right?
your work used to be great , now i\ x9ds not so great .
everything okay at home?
are you asking me?
i'm teaching you .
you just learned a management technique .
don't mind me teaching you , do you?
sir .
good .
just one more little thing .
but , marie , he wants me to cut it .
i\ x9ds a job , sam .
shave it off .
you'll forget you ever had a mustache .
i won't forget .
i'll never forget .
marie , don't you remember?
remember what?
daddy , do you like my picture?
yes , honey , i\ x9ds very nice .
i grew it for you .
sam , please .
mom !
you've got to see these people , they just lie to make money .
and then , i'm the sleazy one of these so called businessmen .
god damn it .
i mean they don't have any right ... ... to say half of the things that they say to us .
i mean , look at the way they make you dress .
i dress like this so i can support my family .
can't you see what they're doing to us?
you're going to lose this job , aren't you?
what?
i'm not going to lose my job .
just tell me now , because i can do it on my own .
i'm doing great .
i'm so tired of this .
i don't want you stopping by like this anymore .
i really mean it .
i think it looks good .
and it makes me look a little older and trustworthy .
you would trust me .
tha\ x9ds not really the point , though .
what i'm saying is ...
i'm surprised you would say that , bonny .
i really am .
because i would think that you would have more feeling .
joey , le\ x9ds get some of these dishes cleared and get you to bed .
no .
you sit .
joey .
yes , ma'am .
tha\ x9ds a good kid .
tha\ x9ds a real good kid .
his mother taught him well .
i bet she did .
no offense , but i wouldn't be surprised ... ... if his father had a little something to do with that .
he probably got something from me .
what do you think?
if your father went away ... ... would that make you sad?
he's not gonna go away .
of course he's not .
if he did?
if your mommy wanted him to go .
she wouldn't say that .
why don't you just leave those there .
i\ x9ds past your bedtime .
give your father a kiss .
good night , daddy .
good night , baby .
things will work out , sam .
you'll see .
good night , mommy .
good night , baby .
say good night to your uncle sam .
good night , uncle sam .
good night , son .
i know it was important to you , sam .
i want to thank you for the sacrifice .
i think it was a good decision .
now you can smile .
you look like a family man instead of some schmuck with a pussy on his face .
marty?
yes .
get up to the spic's place and get me an egg salad ... ... and whatever else you want .
is independence too much to ask , mr. bernstein?
i mean , you're your own boss , right?
you don't have any idea what i\ x9ds like to work for somebody else ... ... like some kind of a slave .
but i'm telling you , slavery never really ended in this country .
they just gave it another name .
employee .
remember power is a state of mind .
you have as much as you think you have .
if you don't think you have any , you don't .
talk about yourself as you see yourself ... ... and someday that will be yourself .
the salesman must see himself as a winner .
say it along with me .
i'm not sure i understand this business about the school bus .
tha\ x9ds just it .
the bus is the business .
i\ x9ds a movable store .
a movable tire store?
exactly .
you see , we take out all of the seats , just gut the whole bus ... ... and put the tires .
fill it up with the tires .
then you bring the tires to the customer , at his convenience .
you're a delivery service .
tha\ x9ds just the beginning of it , because i would bring the tire ... ... and change it , i'll put the tire on your car while you're mowing the lawn .
or anything else that that you want to do .
and we'd paint the bus a bright red because that would give the company ... ... its own individual identity and make it memorable .
a sort of trademark .
and you have the bus already?
my friend , my partner , bonny , has the bus and he has the tools .
and i bring the management experience .
and that you have as well?
that i do , sir .
yes , i do .
it says here you're currently employed as an office furniture salesman?
tha\ x9ds correct .
but i'm ready to move on .
and prior to office sales , you were a tire salesman with your father?
julius bicke , tha\ x9ds my brother .
brother .
okay , and why did you leave his employment?
he expected me to lie .
i don't believe that someone should have to lie to make a living .
all right .
over and over he would tell me ... ... that 15 % is rock bottom .
sell below that , we lose money .
tha\ x9ds a lie .
in the retail tire business , the markup is always at least 30 % .
so , 30 is rock bottom .
what one should tell the customer ...
let me show you .
good morning , mr. ford .
i think i understand , mr. bicke ...
let me just show you .
good morning .
sam bicke .
you're here to buy tires .
yes .
le\ x9ds get down to brass tacks .
this is the deal .
the markup on all of my tires is 30 % .
i will show you the company invoice to prove that to you .
i'll do that for you , mr. ford .
i'll make you my best offer .
i'll split the difference with you .
i'll take half the markup as my profit ... ... and you'll take half the markup as your savings .
even steven .
fair deal .
what do you think?
what do i think?
or ...
yes .
no , i'm back to normal now .
i\ x9ds 15 % .
exactly .
but i\ x9ds the same thing , what your brother offered .
no .
my brother ... ... will go to 15 % , but he wants you to hold at list .
5 % if you have to ... 10 % if you're gonna lose the customer out the door .
but the salesman who offers 15 % , he's a failure .
he's a man who doesn't know how to hold his ground .
and who do you think , at the end of the month ... ... gets the promotion , gets the bonus?
the one with the biggest profit margin?
the biggest liar .
i'm sorry .
i just want you to know that i would run an honest business .
that i would not ask my salesmen to lie ... ... or make them feel like a failure ... ... or some kind of a piece of garbage .
well , tha\ x9ds ...
i admire that .
your idea?
yes , sir .
well , tha\ x9ds it .
tha\ x9ds it?
mr. ford , i want to thank you , sir , because this loan isn't just for me .
i think it can change the way we think about american business .
mr. bicke , i'm really very sorry .
tha\ x9ds it for now .
i have to send your application on to washington ... ... and they will review it .
and i\ x9ds a whole process .
of course .
mr. ford at the sba ...
bonny , i gotta tell you , he was very impressed .
did you tell him the bus don't run?
i didn't .
did you tell him your partner was black?
i did , yes .
i checked the " negro " box .
that was stupid , sam .
this isn't working .
no , bonny .
the government is looking for black businessmen .
i've been here 16 years , and they haven't found me yet .
ellen , sit next to julie .
sam .
come on , son .
ellen , can you just sit .
tha\ x9ds great , julie .
ellen , sit next to your sister .
come on , sam jr .
ellen , honey , sit next to julie .
come on , you guys .
dinner's ready .
daddy's taking a picture .
tha\ x9ds all right , honey , i got it .
see you next sunday , sam .
yeah , i'll see you next sunday .
tuffer !
no .
$125 is your total .
i let the tax slide .
thank you .
you remind me of my ex wife .
she's got the dimples , also , when she smiles .
they're nice .
compliments and a good deal .
i should shop here more often .
you should , miss , or is it missus?
miss .
is this the current phone?
yes .
would you like me to deliver it?
no .
tha\ x9ds all right .
i'll have someone from the office stop by .
it wouldn't be a problem .
i'll be just fine .
you already are .
i don't want you to deliver it .
i'll have it picked up .
i didn't mean me , personally .
we have people who deliver .
i think there's been a misunderstanding .
i love my wife very much .
we are all married men .
family men .
yeah .
because ... ... wha\ x9ds odd about your aborted flirtation with that woman today ... ... according to marty's recollection , correct me if i'm wrong ... ... is that you referred to her dimples ... ... as being like those of your ex wife's .
i don't think i did that .
he sure did .
i think there's been a misunderstanding .
as i told you when i took you on ...
i only hire married men .
a single salesman is distracted .
a divorced salesman fails at selling , the same as marriage .
i\ x9ds all right for a guy to ... ... lie to some broad about not being married when he is .
tha\ x9ds fine .
tha\ x9ds to be expected .
but you wouldn't expect that guy to lie to his boss , would you?
i guess i did try to pick up on that woman .
i didn't want you to think that i was being dishonest to my wife .
you did try to pick her up then?
yes .
my son was correct in his estimation of your character?
yes .
and if i were to ask you and your wife to join ... ... me and marty and our wives for dinner in , say , a week or two ... ... that would be okay with you?
yes , i think that ...
... she'd like that very much .
when i was little i was taught not to be rude , mr. bernstein , but ... ... what am i supposed to do about the people who won't respect me?
what i wanted to do is just check on the status of my application .
sorry , mr. bicke .
mr. ford should have told you , but processing takes eight to ten weeks .
no , he did not tell me that .
perhaps you could check back , say , september 1 .
september?
yes .
i do understand your position .
i'm sure that you deal with a lot of incompetence .
but i am a businessman ... ... and a businessman can't wait .
if you gonna have a future , you gotta make it .
so i would really appreciate it if i could see mr. ford .
what was your first name?
samuel j.
i will talk to mr. ford ... ... and if he has time for a meeting , we'll call you next week .
since i'm here , maybe i could just see him ...
if he has time , we'll call you next week .
deal?
deal .
least you could do is discourage him .
double bourbon and a vodka martini up .
it would help if you wore your wedding ring .
for god's sake , sam , aren't we done yet?
would you consider going to the dinner?
you could drive your own car .
i'm not gonna put on some charade .
if you're their top salesman ... ... what do they care if you're married , divorced , or queer?
sir , you should be ashamed of yourself .
that woman is my wife .
they make her wear that .
sam .
really , i\ x9ds all right .
i'll just wait here .
i'm fine here .
mr. bicke , please ...
he'll understand .
he'll leave at some point and he'll be going to his car .
he'll leave at some point , i'll walk him down .
tha\ x9ds all the time ...
mr. bicke .
mr. ford .
i\ x9ds good to see you , sir .
why don't we step outside and get a cup of coffee?
how's that?
coffee .
in the cafeteria .
actually , there's a machine in the lobby .
the lobby's fine .
have a seat .
now , how exactly can i help you , mr. bicke?
yes , well , sir ...
funnily enough , my situation is that i really ...
i\ x9ds very urgent that i get this thing rolling , if you know what i mean .
no , i don't .
the bus thing .
the tire thing .
yes , i remember your application and i sent it along .
now there's really nothing more i can do .
you can't tell me anything else?
no , i can't .
i told you in our meeting , and i believe you were told again ... ... that the process will take eight to ten weeks .

please let them know , maestro ... ... let them know i was nervous ... ... that unlike the powerful , i was not so arrogant ... ... as to be sure that my actions were righteous .
certainty is the disease of kings , maestro .
and sam bicke was many things , but not a king .
he just wanted to make a change .
to stop the lies .
and he aimed high .
hello , samuel .
the landlord was kind enough to allow me in .
he stopped by .
i see you received his note .
julius .
we have some things to discuss , don't you think?
to discuss?
good seeing you , of course .
cut the crap .
sit down .
you're a very strange man , samuel .
i've always known this .
i've always tried to help .
so why would you steal from me , your brother?
i didn't steal ...
you did .
i had to bail your friend , bonny , out of jail this evening .
bonny?
for receiving stolen goods .
my goods .
did you think roger zeffler wouldn't become suspicious of your friend?
that somehow this delivery was kosher?
that 550 tires belonged to that address?
roger zeffler is a racist .
perhaps tha\ x9ds so .
shame on roger zeffler .
but you are a crook .
so , you tell me , sam .
which shame is greater?
i am not ...
look at me .
this is your brother .
do i deserve this now , for you to lie to me?
julius , please .
no .
no " please , julius " .
no !
i have been to the police .
begging forgiveness for a mistake that was not a mistake .
because i took responsibility , samuel .
so that no one would go to jail .
so that this man , bonny , your friend , would not go to jail .
and my family caused this .
so you must tell me , sam , please ... ... which is the greater shame?
i'm sorry , julius .
what is your name?
i had an idea .
for a tire business .
like you .
i wanted to get a head start until my loan came in , and my loan was denied .
because they're racists .
nixon .
all of them .
like zeffler .
i didn't get the money because my partner is black .
i was gonna pay you back .
i'm just trying to keep my family together .
and the little guy just can't do it anymore .
because there's a cancer in the system .
the whole system has a cancer , and i'm being punished because i resist .
but somebody has to resist .
you're my brother .
as of this moment , samuel ...
i wash my hands of you .
no more .
tha\ x9ds it .
nothing .
and if you steal from me again , brother or no brother ...
i will send you to jail .
you can pick the only luxury convertible made in america .

good evening .
secret service officials are still puzzling over ... ... the landing of an army helicopter early today ... ... on the south lawn of the white house .
it all started shortly after midnight last night ... ... when army private first class , robert preston ... ... stole an unarmed helicopter ... ... from fort mead , maryland .
the joy riding pilot was identified as 20 year old pfc robert preston ... ... an army helicopter mechanic ... ... who was reportedly unhappy over flunking out of flight school .
he was charged with unlawful entry into the white house grounds .
i sincerely believe that if his attitude was to crash into the white house ... ... he could have accomplished it without any problem .
do you think his attitude was to crash into the white house?
i do .
i really do .
it wasn't like a light bulb really .
it was more like an old candle ... ... just a plain , simple idea .
but in that moment , mr. bernstein , i knew ... ... the die was cast .
mr. bernstein ...
i have the utmost respect for you .
your music ... ... is both pure and honest .
and that is why i have chosen you ... ... to present the truth about me to the world .
$120 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 200 .
one , two , three , four and 33 cents .
there you are , mr. bicke .
all cashed out .
i'm sorry .
i\ x9ds a shame innocent lives are going to have to be lost , maestro .
and i will do my best to prevent as many deaths ... ... as i possibly can .
but that won't be easy .
if history teaches us anything ... ... i\ x9ds that you have got to get the seat of government .
the whole goddamned chair , you just kick it out .
let the system dangle till it doesn't breathe .
if you destroy the seat of government , then you've made a change .
a real change .
and i am going to do it .
no , this is ...
i'm sure i\ x9ds just ...
i have an injury .
i\ x9ds okay .
thank you .
good morning , gentlemen .

i want you to fly this plane , and i want you to fly it low .

i\ x9ds a shame there aren't more people like bonny .
what a beautiful man .
i hope that he will forgive me for stealing his gun .
they let you in looking like that?
i wanted to talk to you .
i'm sorry things didn't work out .
no hard feelings .
i wanted to thank you for teaching me ... ... that to be a salesman ... ... you don't have to be a good man .
you got a fever , bicke?
you're sweating like a pig .
here , wipe your forehead , for chris\ x9ds sake .
i'm trying to eat a meal .

sam , i can fly the plane myself .
just let her go .
please let me go .
i don't want to die .
look at me , maestro .
am i smiling?
tell them why i did this , maestro .
history needs to be clear on this .
they can rebuild the white house , but they will never ... ... forget me .
not ever .
i was here , maestro .
i did this .
and a man is only remembered for his work .
just tell them that .
the first hijack attempt in the united states in more than a year ... ... was made today in baltimore .
it failed .
there had not been another hijacking attempt in this country until today .
and it happened at the same baltimore airport , but with far worse consequences .
forty four year old samuel bicke walked to the departure gate ... ... carrying a harmless looking attach case which contained gasoline and a detonator .
he was running and acting like he was crazy .
out of his mind .
bicke ran through the boarding bridge yelling for passengers to get out of his way .
a policeman ran after him , but by that time ... ... bicke was inside and had forced the stewardesses to close the door .
the policeman fired through the door's window ... ... and killed the would be hijacker .
his motive may never be known , but authorities say that there's no question ... ... the hijacker intended to destroy himself and everyone else aboard delta flight 523 .
