uh ...
i got to go .
i got to go .
i got to catch a plane .
two hours of staring at material to decide to reconvene after the holidays .
they're selling cosmetics , not curing cancer .
why aren't you going to the airport?
why bust my ass?
take the 8 : 00 flight with me .
i told susan i'd be home by 9 : 00 .
that's you .
i left my gloves in brian's office .
i don't need them to fly home .
would you pick them up?
i'll get them tomorrow .
have a good holiday .
see you in chicago .
you'll never make the 6 : 00 .
ha ha !
taxi !
oof !
cab !
cab !
sir?
sir?
sir?
excuse me .
could i appeal to your good nature and ask you for your cab?
i don't have a good nature .
excuse me .
come on !
could i offer you $ 10?
20 .
i'll give you $20 .
i'll take 50 .
all right .
anyone who would pay $50 for a cab would certainly pay $ 75 .
not necessarily .
all right , 75 .
you're a thief .
close .
i'm an attorney .
have a happy holiday .
this will help .
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey , that's my cab !

excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .

mom?

of course he'll give you noogies .
it means he loves you .
why don't i get noogies?
because you get indian burns .
but i prefer noogies .
keep an eye on your brother .
hello .

shh .
where are you?
who is it?
shh !
it's daddy .
flight delay .

no later than 10 : 00 .
i'll wait up for you .
i know you , don't i?
i'm usually good with names , but i've forgotten yours .
you stole my cab .
i've never stolen anything in my life .
i hailed a cab on park avenue today .
before i could get in , you stole it .
you're the guy who tried to get my cab .
i knew i knew you .
yeah .
you scared the bejesus out of me .
it was awful easy getting a cab during rush hour .
forget it .
i can't forget it .
i am sorry .
i had no idea that was your cab .
let me make it up to you somehow .
how about a hot dog and a beer?
uh , no , thanks .
just a hot dog , then .
i'm picky about what i eat .
some coffee .
no .
milk?
no .
soda?
some tea?
lifesavers?
slurpee?
sir , please .
just let me know .
i'm here .
i knew i knew you .
you should have discussed this with the ticket agent .
i didn't know he put me in coach .
i'm sorry .
first class is full .
i have a first class ticket .
you have a coach seat assignment .
hi , larry .
hi , liz .
here ok?
oh , here , there .
anywhere's fine .
pardon me .
you'll get a refund on the difference .
i want a seat in first class where i was booked over a month ago .
i've had enough of you .
now take your seat .
you've had enough of me?
first you delay me , then you bump me .
what happens next?
is this a coincidence or what?
have a seat .
i never did introduce myself .
del griffith .
american light and fixture ...
director of sales , shower curtain ring division .
i sell shower curtain rings .
best in the world .
and you are?
uh , neal page .
neal page .
pleased to meet you , neal page .
so what do you do for a living , neal page?
marketing .
marketing?
super .
super .
fabulous .
isn't that nice?
i don't want to be rude , but ...
i'm not much of a conversationalist .
i'd like to finish this article .
a friend wrote it , so ...
don't let me stop you .
last thing i want to be is an annoying blabbermouth .
nothing grinds my gears worse than some chowderhead who can't keep his trap shut .
catch me running off at the mouth , give me a poke .
ohh !
ohh , that feels good .
oh , god , i'm telling you .
my dogs are barking today .
whew !
ohh !
that feels better .
six bucks and my right nut says we're not landing in chicago .
hello .
hi .
where are you?
i'm in wichita .
wichita , kansas?
are you all right?
what happened?
we couldn't land in chicago .
i don't understand what wichita has to do with a snowstorm in chicago?
what's going on , neal?
we took off from new york , they closed chicago , we landed here .
neal .
trouble on the home front?
i really don't think that's any of your concern .
the finest line a man will walk is between success at work and success at home .
i got a motto ...
like your work , love your wife .
well , i'll remember that .
what's the flight situation?
simple .
no way we'll get out of here tonight .
we'd have more luck playing pickup sticks with our butt cheeks .
we'll find out soon enough .
by the time the airline cancels this flight , which they will eventually , you'd have a better chance finding a three legged ballerina than a hotel room .
i could be stuck here?
i'm saying you are stuck here .
ladies and gentlemen , may i have your attention , please .
i'm sorry to announce that we're canceling flight 909 due to severe weather in chicago .
hi , i was wondering if you had any rooms available for tonight?
anything .
anything will do .
i'm sorry .
is there another motel ...
neal .
hi .
well?
welcome to wichita .
did you book a room yet?
i , uh , couldn't get in anywhere .
when we arrived , you called home .
i called the braidwood inn .
i missed that one .
i got an idea .
i know the manager .
if you pick up the cab fare ,
i'll make sure you get a room .
umm ...
yeah .
yeah , sure .
great .
all right .
grab an end of this thing , will you?
thanks a lot .
is this your trunk?
yeah .
you should try lugging this thing around new york city .
# well , it takes you up #
# and it beats you down , yeah #
# it plays around #
# and it spends your money ... ##
where the hell is the motel?
doobie , is it much farther?
not much .
why didn't you take the interstate?
your friend has never been here , so i figured he'd like to look around .
there's nothing on the interstate .
it's the middle of the night .
i know , but he's proud of his town .
that's a rare thing these days .
take care of the luggage , will you , doobie?
ok , del .
get off of me .
stick with me .
evening , gus .
del griffith , how the hell are you?
still a million bucks shy of being a millionaire .
gus , meet an old friend .
neal page , gus mooney .
glad to meet you , nick .
i told my friend you'd give him a room tonight .
do you have a major credit card?
do you still honor those discount credit cards?
i'll have to charge you for a double , but with the discount , it'll come out even .
we're a pretty good team .
we were on our way to chicago , and the storm brought us here .
i know .
i must have half your flight here .
well , i guess you're all fixed , so , uh , there you are .
last room in the complex .
you mean sh share?
hey , easy on that .
ok .
hell of a cab ride , wasn't it?
yeah , you don't see cabs like that too often .
want to take a shower?
no !
i meant , did you want to go first?
you you thought ...
i wouldn't ...
what do you think i am?
gee , that's funny .
ah .
ah .
oh , come ... come on .
ah !
ouch , ouch , ouch !
to wear a pompadour ...
excuse me .
i'd switch pillows with you , but i'm allergic to sponge .
i'd be sneezing all night with that thing .
that's why i carry my own pillow .
it's hypoallergenic .
i had no idea those beer cans would blow like that .
you left them on a vibrating bed .
what did you think would happen?
it just didn't occur to me .
it didn't occur to you , so i have to sleep in a puddle of beer .
you want to switch?
i just want to sleep .
me , too .
i am bushed .
good night .
good night .
i'll have to burn the sheets !
what if the shoe was on the other foot?
i'd go barefoot !
traffic is resuming at o'hare field , and flights will be moving shortly .
sorry .
goddamn !
what , what?
that's it !
without clearing my sinuses , i'll snore all night .
if your kid spills his milk , do you slap him?
what what what is that supposed to mean?
you're not a very tolerant person .
you've bugged me since new york , starting with stealing my cab .
god , you're a tight ass .
how would you like a mouthful of teeth?
oh , and hostile , too .
nice personality combination ... hostile and intolerant .
that's borderline criminal .
screw you .
you spilled beer all over the bed , you mess up the bathroom ...
who let you stay?
i even let you pay , so you wouldn't feel like an intruder .
an intruder?
right .
you ruined a nice trip .
who talked my ear off on the plane?
who was that?
i'm curious .
who told you to book a room?
i did .
you're an ungrateful jackass .
sleep in the lobby .
i hope you wake up so stiff you can't even move .
you got a free cab , a free room , and someone who will listen to your boring stories .
didn't you notice on the plane when you started talking ,
i started reading the vomit bag?
didn't that give you some clue that this guy's not enjoying it?
everything's not an anecdote .
you have to discriminate .
you choose things that are funny or mildly amusing or interesting .
you're a miracle .
your stories have none of that .
they're not even amusing accidentally .
honey , meet del griffith .
he's got some amusing anecdotes .
here's a gun so you can blow your brains out .
you'll thank me for it .
i could tolerate any insurance seminar .
for days , i could listen to them go on and on .
they'd say , " how can you stand it?
and i'd say , " 'cause i've been with del griffith .
i can take anything .
you know what they'd say?
i know what you mean .
the shower curtain ring guy .
it's like going on a date with a chatty cathy doll .
there should be a string on your chest that i pull out .
except i wouldn't pull it out , you would .
ah !
ah !
ah !
ah !
by the way , when you're telling these little stories , here's a good idea .
have a point .
it makes it more interesting for the listener .
you want to hurt me?
go ahead if it makes you feel better .
i'm an easy target .
yeah , you're right .
i talk too much .
i also listen too much .
i could be a cold hearted cynic like you , but i don't like to hurt people's feelings .
well , you think what you want about me .
i'm not changing .
i like ...
i like me .
my wife likes me .
my customers like me .
'cause i'm the real article .
what you see is what you get .
# i'm back in baby's arms #
# how i miss those lovin 'arms #
# i am back where i belong #
# back in baby's arms #
# don't know why we quarreled #
# we never did before #
# since we found out how it hurts ... ##
del .
hmm?
yeah .
why did you kiss my ear?
why are you holding my hand?
where's your other hand?
between two pillows .
those aren't pillows !
aah !
oh , no !
ooh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
see that bears 'game last week?
hell of a game .
they're going all the way .
ohh , yeow .
neal , take my socks out of the sink if you're going to brush your teeth .
where are you?
i'm in wichita .
i'm at a motel with this guy i met on the plane .
you shared a motel room with a stranger?
are you crazy?
i'm getting there .
did you call the airline?
i have a good chance of getting on standby .
if they told you wolverines make good house pets , would you believe them?
i'm not spending thanksgiving in wichita .
i'll get home .
mmm .
not by airplane .
they got 18 hours of air traffic backed up .
we're going to be having our turkey roll right here .
if we wait for the flight .
how else can we get home?
burt dingman .
he works for the railroad .
i sold them all their shower curtain rings .
he owes me a favor .
i'll get that .
i paid for everything else .
why break precedent?
you're making me feel like a freeloader .
get me on the train , we're square .
you got it .
that's the easy part .
what?
you know goddamn well what .
i'm sorry .
i don't .
i had over $ 700 in here .
i'm a lot of things , but i'm not a thief .
you went into my stuff last night , right?
i didn't take your money .
i had over $ 700 .
you went into my wallet for pizza .
just maybe when you went into ...
count it !
like you'd keep it in there .
there's $263 in there .
if there's more , you can call me a thief .
count it !
263 , right?
empty .
what?
we were robbed .
do you think so?
i've been thinking .
what we're dealing with is a smalltime crook .
he didn't take the credit cards , so we charge our way home .
i've got a visa and a gasoline card .
oh , and a neiman marcus card in case we want to buy a gift .
what have you got?
chalmer's big and tall men's shoppe , a seven outlet chain in the pacific northwest .
unfortunately , it does us no good here .
get me to the train station , and i'll take care of everything else .
gus 'son is picking us up .
this is not him , is it?
gee , i hope not .
are you gus 'son?
i'm owen .
you the shower curtain fella?
yeah .
yeah .
del griffith .
how are you?
this is neal page from chicago .
hi .
pleased to meet you both .
i'm to drive you to wichita to catch a train?
yeah , we'd appreciate it .
train don't run out of wichita .
'lessen you're a hog or cattle .
people train runs out of stubbville .
that'll be fine .
that'll be just fine .
leave it be .
get your lazy behind out here and put that in back .
no .
we've got it .
it's very heavy .
she don't mind .
she's short and skinny , but she's strong .
her first baby ... come out sideways .
she didn't scream or nothing .
isn't that something?
you're a real trooper .
we've got it already .
it's done .
you know , stubbville's a little further than wichita .
how much further?
30 miles .
maybe 40 .
no more than 45 though , depending on how he goes .
it could be anywhere up to 70 miles .
woof !
woof !
give me the glove .
ow !
just nipped .
little part .
ooh !
give him the goddamn glove !
are we there yet?
no , a little way to go yet .
beautiful country though , isn't it?
what do you figure the temperature is?
1 .
thanks .
they didn't have two together .
you got to be kidding me .
oh , i knew it .
the secretary was new , and i explained it .
oh , ge ...
i'm sorry .
they're just full .
it's the holidays , i guess .
hey , we're lucky we got a ticket .
yeah .
so , if i don't see you again .
want to meet for a drink on the train?
i'm going to sleep .
you sure?
yeah .
anyway , it's been interesting .
that's the understatement of the year .
and thanks for the ticket .
neal !
i need your address .
i got to pay you back for this ticket .
ticket's a gift .
no , no .
come on now .
what's the address?
del , it's a gift .
happy holidays .
same to you .
hi .
going home for thanksgiving?
yeah .
me , too .
we're just going to make it .
what did you do here?
do you smell smoke?
you walk a mile to the highway .
the trucks will take you into jefferson city .
you're in a lousy mood , huh?
to say the least .
you ever travel by bus before?
hmm .
your mood's probably not going to improve much .
# well , i got you in my sights #
# just one of those nights with you #
# and if you wanna fool around #
# well , let me pin you to the ground #
neal , neal .
check that out .
# all the little boys are into soul #
# and all the girls wanna rock 'n 'roll #
# you all wanna dance #
# it's what you're paid to do ##
beats a movie on a plane , huh?
take a picture .
it'll last longer .
you got busted .
oh , that was good .
this is a good time to tell you this .
our tickets are only good to st. louis .
st. louis to chi town is booked tighter than tom thumb's ass .
# ...

that was fun , wasn't it?
all right .
who wants to sing a tune?
who's got a song?

these aren't the originals , but they are replicas .
very good replicas , too .
they're selling for $5 . 00 a pair .
# spring over the ground like a hunting hound #
# for this is thanksgiving day ##
i'm marti page , and i'm thankful that my dad's coming home for thanksgiving .
you know something?
it makes you look a little older , too .
you could pass for 18 or 19 .
did you call the wife?
no one was home .
probably at my daughter's thanksgiving pageant .
ohh .
you missed it .
i'm sorry .
those ... those are the precious moments , too .
they don't come back again .
i've been spending too much time away from home .
i haven't been home in years .
what , seriously?
it's a figure of speech .
i'm away so much , it's like not being there .
i called a friend of mine at eastern airlines .
it doesn't look good .
i know .
i called all the airlines .
well , at least we're sitting on over 100 beans from my brilliant idea .
you're a terrific salesman .
you know , uh ...
i've been thinking that when we put our heads together , we really ... we've really gotten nowhere .
and , uh ... you know , i think i'm holding you up .
don't say that about yourself .
that's not true , neal .
i think we'll get where we're going a lot faster if , uh ... we were alone .
ok?
ok .
i see .
i think i'll just take care of this and get going .
i appreciate that .
it's just harder for two people to travel .
yeah , sure .
if you've got reservations ...
i understand .
thanks for the meal .
yeah , that's all right .
and i owe you some of this , too .
no , no , no , no .
this is your cut .
take the money .
buy your kids a chocolate turkey .
i'm just going to leave it there .
then leave it .
fine .
i'm done , ok?
i've got to go , so if you'll excuse me , uh , i got things to do , uh ... so , uh ... good luck , and i hope you get home soon .
i'll see you .
yeah , sure you will .

ohh ...
ahem .
i'll see you tomorrow then .
gobble gobble .
ohh ... bye bye .
welcome to marathon .
may i help you?
yes .
how may i help you?
you can start by wiping that fucking dumb ass smile off your rosy fucking cheeks .
then give me a fucking automobile .
a fucking datsun , a fucking toyota , a fucking buick .
four fucking wheels and a seat .
i don't care for the way you're speaking .
i don't care for the way your company left me in fucking nowhere with keys to a fucking car that isn't fucking there .
i didn't care to fucking walk down a fucking highway and across a fucking runway to get back here to have you smile at my fucking face .
i want a fucking car right fucking now .
may i see your rental agreement?
i threw it away .
oh , boy .
oh , boy , what?
you're fucked .
# you're messin 'with the wrong guy ##
ok , 86 , wake up .
you're going to block the line .
yeah , where you going?
chicago .
chicago?
chicago .
you know you're in st. louis?
yes , i do .
the airlines are faster , and you get a free meal .
if i wanted jokes ,
i'd watch you take a leak .
don't just stand there
like a slab of meat with mittens .
what are you doing?
i almost crushed your head like a melon .
del?
move your car !
just a minute , ok?
get outta here !
what is your problem?
you insensitive asshole .
there's an injured man down on the street .
now , i'll move my car , but you help him up .
no !
my pleasure .
ohh ...
i had a feeling that when we parted ways , somehow , someday , our paths would cross again .
are you all right?
i've never seen anyone get lifted by his testicles before .
lucky thing for you that cop came when he did .
otherwise , you'd be lifting your schnutz to tie your shoes .
i'm sorry .
that's terrible .
you know , i'm glad i didn't kill you .
i'd be glad if you had .
oh , you don't mean that .
remember what i said?
go with the flow .
how can i when the rental car agency
leaves me keys to a car that isn't there , then i find out they don't have any more cars?
i got a car , no sweat at all .
well , del , you're a charmed man .
nope .
oh , i know .
you just go with the flow .
like a twig on the shoulders of a mighty stream .
# pulled out of pittsburgh #
# rollin 'down the eastern seaboard #
# i got my diesel wound up #
# she's runnin 'like never before #
# there's a speed zone ahead , all right #
# i ain't seen a cop all night #
# six days on the road #
# and i'm gonna make it home tonight ... ##
would you please stop doing that with the seat?
once you screw with these , you never get comfortable .
quit screwing with it .
i'm getting comfortable .
do you have a bad back?
well , i do , and there's only a couple good positions .
you're going to break it .
ahh .
done .
ah , lovely .
lovely , lovely .
oh , damn it .
what now?
i can't reach my feet to get my shoes off .
that's fine .
leave your shoes on .
i can't relax that way .
i don't care to breathe your foot odor .
it must be swell being so perfect and odor free .
things about you bother me , but i'm decent enough not to bring them up .
what about me bothers you?
there's lots of things .
name one .
you want me to name one?
fine , um ... you play with your balls a lot .
i do not play with my balls .
larry bird doesn't handle the ball as much as you do .
you trying to start a fight?
i'm simply stating a fact .
you fidget with your nuts .
know what make me happy?
another couple of balls and an extra set of fingers?
oh , that's humor .
oh , that's real humor .
i'd be happy if you rested your mouth .
my pleasure .
i'd like a little silence .
no problem .
thank you .
you're welcome .
you broke the seat .
you broke the goddamn seat .
i don't believe it .
it wasn't broken when i got out .
you broke it .
it's impossible to break them .
impossible?
you want to drive?
no .
why did you do this?
i won't be held responsible for faulty engineering .
this is comfortable .
this is really comfortable .
i don't want to argue .
let's not fight .
all right , all right .
then i'm going to sleep .
all right .
i'm putting my wallet in the glove compartment .
don't let me forget it .
all right .

you couldn't .
how could you do it?
i gave this gal behind the counter a set of shower curtain rings .
you can't rent a car with shower curtain rings .
well , uh ... somehow your , uh ... diner's club card wound up in my wallet , and i , uh , just ...
you stole it !
not exactly .
you stole my card !
i didn't .

i found it in my wallet !
i thought you put it there .
why would i do that?
kindness?
kindness?
kindness?
you stole it !
he stole it !
no , i didn't .
i was going to send it back to you with whatever the rental car charge was , plus interest .
you didn't give me your address .
what could i do?
you just ditched me .
i had no money , no cards , nothing .
give it back !
i can't !
why not?
because !
because why?
when we stopped to gas up ,
i put the card back in your wallet .
ohh .
are you mad at me?
ohh !
ohh !
you know , you could've killed me , slugging me in the gut when i wasn't ready .
that's how houdini died .
ow .
ah !
one good thing about it ... with all this fresh air , we'll sleep like babies .
neal?
hey , hey , neal , wait up .

no , i don't .
i have , uh ...
i have $2 . 00 and , uh ... and a casio .
mmm .
i'm going to have to say good night , so ...
well , marie , once again , my dear , you were as right as rain .
i am , without a doubt , the biggest pain in the butt that ever came down the pike .
i meet someone whose company i really enjoy , and what do i do?
i go overboard .
i smother the poor soul .
i cause him more trouble than he has a right to .
god , i got a big mouth .
ohh .
when am i ever going to wake up?
i wish you were here with me right now .
but i guess ... that's not going to happen .
not now , anyway .
what did i do to get hooked up with this guy?
you're going to freeze to death out there .
how's your drink?
good .
go for another one?
where you been?

you had amaretto?
i have amaretto , and this is a gin .
is there a tequila there?
ahem .

is this a good combo or what?
no , probably not .
me , i'm going back to , uh , jamaica .
jamaica , man .

dig it .
iree , iree , man .
oh , shit .
you know , when i'm dead and buried , all i'll have to prove i was here was some shower curtain rings that didn't fall down .
great legacy , huh?
at the very least , at the absolute minimum , you've got a woman you love to grow old with , right?
you love her , don't you?
love is not a big enough word .
it's not a big enough word for how i feel about my wife .
to the wives .
to the wives .
wow .
well , let me just close this conversation by saying you are one unique individual .
what is unique?
uh ... latin for asshole?
grab those .
i'm going to kick them off .
as much trouble as i've had on this little journey ,
i'm sure one day i'll look back and laugh .
you think so?
oh , i'm laughing already .
oh , god .
oh , when that car blew up .
was that seat hot or what?
i feel like a big whopper .
turn me over .
i'm done on this side .
i'm afraid to look at my ass .
i'm going to have those griddle marks on my ass .
ha ha ha .
potato chips .
they're everywhere !
aah !
ha ha ha !
this feels like summer camp .
ha ha ha !
aah !
now how the hell does this turn off?
ow !
aah !

just a minute .
give it a good push .
all right .
all right .
oh , geez .

we have to rock it .
all right .

# blue moon of kentucky , keep on shining #
# shine on the one that's gone and been untrue #
# blue moon of kentucky , keep on shining #
# shine on the one who's gone and left me blue #
# it was on a moonlit night #
# stars shinin 'bright #
# they whispered from on high #
# your love has said good bye #
# blue moon of kentucky , keep on shining ##
oh .
oh , great .
great .
a cop .
watch it !
how fast are you going?
i can't tell .
the speedometer's melted .
pull over .
top of the morning , officer .
hi .
is there something i can help you with?
what the hell you driving?
we had a small fire last night .
you have any idea how fast you were going?
our speedometer's melted .
it's hard to say with any degree of accuracy how fast we were going .
78 miles an hour .
78 , huh?
well , yeah .
i can buy that .
sure .
you'd know better than us , especially since our speedometer's melted .
you feel this vehicle is safe for highway travel?
yes , i do .
it's not pretty , but it will get you where you want to go .
you got no outside mirror .
it's lost .
you have no functioning gauges .
no , not a one .
however , the radio still works .
funny as that may seem , the radio's the only thing that's really working good .
don't ask me how .
i can't let you go .
can't what?
it's not fit for the road .
the vehicle will be impounded until it's made safe for travel .
ok , officer , i admit i broke the law , and for that i'm really sorry .
you got me there , and i won't argue one iota , i swear .
however , um ... if you impound our car ,
i'll be unable to get my friend home for his thanksgiving dinner .
well , our ship has come in .
it's free and it's nonstop .
i said i'd get you home .
just so the heater's working .
the driver's a little freaky about people riding in his cab .
we can't sit there .
then where are we supposed to ride?
beats walking , huh?
you know , you're going to be in chicago in less than three hours , around there , if we don't hit traffic , and i don't think we should since it's thanksgiving .
we're moving now .
you believe this?
it's been a hell of a trip .
sure has .
but , uh , after all is said and done , you did get me home .
next time , let's go first class , all right?
god , i hope there isn't a next time .
i know .
this you?
yeah .
it's been great meeting you .
i'm sorry if i caused you any trouble .
you got me home , and , uh ... a little late .
a couple days .
but , uh ...
i'm a little wiser , too .
me , too .
happy holidays .
same to you .
happy thanksgiving , neal .
give my love to the family .
maybe i'll meet them someday .
say hello to marie for me .
yeah .
so ...
ok .
and you have a happy thanksgiving .
hey , you know it .
so long .
i like ...
i like me .
my wife likes me .
at the very least , the absolute minimum , you've got a woman you love to grow old with , right?
i'm spending too much time away .
i haven't been home in years .
i haven't been home in years .
i haven't been home in years .
del , what are you doing here?
you said you were going home .
what are you doing here?
i , uh ...
i don't have a home .
marie's been dead for eight years .
boy , you are one lucky guy , neal .
i know .
i won't stay long .
maybe i'll just say hi , then be on my way .
just come on .
hiya , kiddo .
