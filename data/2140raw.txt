i remember these five warriors who set out on a journey ... ... to save us all from becoming innocent victims .
they never lost the will to fight for good against evil .
they did everything to fight ... ... souls from the grave who had come back to life .
before we go , you need to know what we are fighting .
when a corpse wasn't at peace , after a while ... ... negative energy would build up ... ... causing physical changes which would allow it to move again .
these zombies feed on living flesh destroying life to live ... ... and eventually turning into vampires .
all powerful , supernatural beings .
wind yes
thunder rain yes
lightning yes
the four of you look after the rest .
this mission is dangerous , stay alert understand?
yes
listen up
if you are bitten by a zombie , you can recover ... ... but once a zombie turns into a vampire ... ... if it attacks you , you too will become a vampire .
master , soon it will be daybreak .
the men haven't slept for days , they're exhausted .
they need to rest , to recuperate .
i feel a negative energy .
we must be extra careful .
master
how close are we now?
according to the map , we have arrived .
this is a fortunated location .
there must be graves around here .
but i also sense danger .
the buried spirits are very restless .
something horrible could happen at any moment .
master , we found it
where?
towards the southeast
this is the grave of a general , but it's been tampered with .
lf the corpse is still inside , that means it hasn't changed yet .
we must blow up the tomb .
if the corpse has gone , it may be a vampire by now .
master , i'll warn the men .
good .
gas
get back there's methane gas everywhere
put out the torches
rain i'm here , master
catch the explosives
master catch
there's a vampire
get him away from me
stay here then ....
it's a wedding party .
we can't tell them there is a vampire .
is the compass working?
it's stopped moving now .
maybe it needs a rest .
master told us to stay alert at all times .
anything could happen at anytime .
he also said that where we find vampires , we will find him .
we might bump into him .
i hope so .
smile , guys .
mr. kow , these are the workers you requested .
are you dumb , or what?
i need more than two helpers .
can these four men work in the kitchen?
yes yes
stop looking at the compass .
what are your names?
wind .
rain .
thunder .
lightning .
wind , thunder , rain and lightning?
what kind of stupid names are those?
from now on , you are kung , hei , fat , choi .
now repeat that .
i'm kung .
hei .
fat .
choi .
those are names for servants .
give them a change of clothes .
let's go to the kitchen .
not in the kitchen .
go and bring in the wedding gifts .
go let's go
stop looking at that compass ...
... or i will fire you let's go .
smile , guys .
the guy's ridiculous .
what gifts?
i don't even see the bride .
where's the bridal sedan?
a bowl of noodles , please .
this compass isn't responding .
maybe we're in the wrong place .
then what are we here for?
i am still worried .
what if master became a vampire too?
stop talking nonsense .
it's possible .
hurry out and greet your bride
the wedding ceremony will begin now .
marriage ceremony
the bride and groom will honor the parents .
i love this .
i have plenty of experiences .
six times .
this time you're going to be fine , don't worry .
i like this .
i like this .
say , did you see the bride?
it's none of our business .
just asking .
seems like there's no vampires here .
let's just get our money and leave .
the jiangs are in the wax business ... ... and they're very unlucky with women .
the son has married six times ... ... and his brides die soon after the wedding .
why are you cleaning up?
you still have work to do .
we thought it was payday .
oh , really?
who's going to take the lanterns down and put everything away?

we're just wiping our hands .
lf you want to quit , fine

i've been paid to rob a wedding .
we're going to help the jiangs celebrate tonight
we're gonna find out if jiang's gold is for real .
what the hell?
we've seen everything in this line of business .
don't panic follow the boss
what's up?
the young master was bitten by a poisonous snake .
snakebite?
it's too late .
he's dead .
please accept my condolences .
goodbye .
young master no , young master

it s all my fault i'll never face you again
i can't stay here anymore but , mr. kow our money

no problem .
chief what are you doing here?

where's my gold?
we didn't get to the jiangs 'last night .
something terrible happened on the way .
don't talk nonsense .
vampires vampires
pal , there's no need to put up a show like this for me .
we all know why you married your sister to the jiangs .
the jiangs are loaded .
i m sure they'll pay off your gambling debts .
what's all this got to do with you?
i il pay you back when i want to , and i say you'll get paid soon .
fine .
okay with me .
i have money .
but my men need money .
of course , i could ask them to cut you a break
are you threatening me with these scumbags?
is this how you repay a debt?
you just killed my men
i m going to beat you up
where are you?
i sent a whole gang out to rob jiang and only one comes back?
you should be disciplined .
i am giving the compass a break , and now it keeps raining .
you said the bride doesn't concern us .
right .
but i see she's got you under her spell .
right .
we're supposed to catch the snake .
right .
the compass seems to be working .
what do you think happened here?
you saw a bird last night in the forest?
yeah .
let's go take a look .
why did you flirt with her?
you know the line of business we're in ... ... ordinary people don't understand it .
we can't communicate with them .
it s hard to develop any relationships .
stop dreaming .
it s no use thinking about it .
who are you?
i m just trying to make a living .
i was hired to find jiang's gold .
please , give me a break
i see .
have you seen ghosts before?
no .
you want to see one?
this place is haunted .
lf you hang around , you'll definitely bump into one .
there are no ghosts here no?
didn't you feel a shiver on your back up there?
you'll see them sooner or later .
them?
you know what i mean .
ghosts?
and worse have you heard of vampires?
yes , vampires .
but i il give you a break .
i m a good scout .
you tell the others that there are vampires here .
tell them to keep away .
okay .
leave by boat .
vampires hate water .
okay .
where do i get a boat?
goddamn vampires .
what are you looking for?
you .
i ran into a bandit searching for jiang's gold .
everyone wants to find out about the gold .
what were you doing in the forest?
i went to check out funny noises .
good .
thunder has sasa and i have you .
dear brother , i know once a woman is married ... ... according to tradition , she must remain with her husband .
but this jiang household is really strange .
i don't think i can stay here much longer .
i hope you understand my situation .
please , help me get out of here .
your sister , sasa .
the snake .
the snake
is anybody here?
anybody here?
sasa , what are you doing?
the house seems to be deserted .
what's wrong with that?
soon you'll get used to the peace and quiet .
our house is huge , don't wander around , you could get lost .
father jiang , can't you please let me go home?
my husband is dead  do you miss him?
i can take you to him .
what?
take me to him?
you dropped your letter .
you'd better pick it up .
son , we've come to see you .
what happened to him?
our family is famous for preserving bodies .
we air dry them and then preserve them with wax .
others only last for a few years ... ... but our technique is guaranteed for life .
don't worry , you'll never be lonely .
my son will be with you forever .
last night , when your wife was sitting next to you ...?
you are a smart girl .
she is just like your husband , she has been preserved .
she'll remain here forever .
sometimes it is a blessing for a couple when one of them can't talk .
don't worry , i il make sure that you get the same treatment when you die .
you'll be here forever .
no .
no .
this is it .
nice jump .
you could scare us to death .
stop searching , they're all over
just like a wax museum .
maybe there's a vampire hiding among these bodies .
gold
this must be the jiangs 'gold .
i wonder how much they are worth .
we're here for the vampire , not the treasure .
you're right .
don't be silly .
we should forget the vampire .
right .
ldiot lf the vampire shows up , we won't live to enjoy the gold
the sun's going down now .
you're right .
you didn't tell me there are vampires at the jiangs 'mansion .
people made up the vampire stories .
i was partially responsible for them too .
many people are scared but it's just a rumor , that's all .
relax , i've worked for the jiangs for years .
i have everything arranged .
everything will go smoothly .
after all those years , you don't know where he hides his gold?
old man jiang was once a police chief .
he's very smart and careful .
so l
the brides are dead .
you must find that snake .
the snake might bite my sister too .
what's your excuse?
they're hunting the snake right at this moment .
my sister's in danger .
what if the old man takes advantage of her?
what are you going to do?
there's man who can help us .
this guy's called a zombie wrangler .
his job is to make the dead move again .
old jiang is not dead , so why would we need this guy?
actually , for generations , the jiangs ... ... have preserved the dead with wax .
we can ask the zombie wrangler to wake up all of the waxed corpses .
just imagine all of those bodies jumping all over the place .
the old man will be busy rounding them all up ... ... that will be our chance to sneak into his house and look for the gold .
it s a perfect plan .
we'll ask him to show you .
i don't buy this crap
they're already dead .
why bother them?
they died in foreign places and i have to help them .
i have to bring them back home to bury them tonight .
you are the zombie wrangler?
let's see how good you are .
is that the best you can do?
tell me ... ... are you here to talk or to fight?
sir , we are here for your help .
we need you to awaken ... ... all of the corpses in jiang's house .
here's the down payment .
please accept it .
help you?
it s no problem , i do it all the time .
you saw what i saw , but ... ... she's mine to protect
let's put it this way , she'll be your sister in law .
we were just trying to watch out for you .
lf anything happens , we're in it together .
quiet down if she hears us , it's all over for me
i m serious about her .
she's mrs. jiang , not your girlfriend .
right .
but they didn't sleep together .
i still have a chance .
anyway , you'll help me out is that right?
you all come with me .
master .
what now?
they're all waxed bodies .
the compass doesn't show anything .
they are all still dead .
you were spying on the young mistress while she was bathing .
you shouldn't have done that .
it s a serious offense .
what , you can look and we can't?
according to our family rules , i must gouge your eyes out
i looked with a pure heart ... ... but he's just a dirty bastard
what's the difference?
you dirty bastard
say that again?
i mean you
i thought you're bulletproof .
what if i am?
you're on your own .
are you okay?
you push too hard .
so you are the unbeatable one?
i thought you couldn't be defeated .
my turn
we better burn all of these corpses .
hold it
we can't start a fire here .
we might burn the house down .
let's move them out .
right
what now?
there may be other corpses , we have to burn them tool
let's double check .
with whom?
we'll pin down the old man and force him to tell us .
okay .
just who are you guys?
are you here to try to rob me?
with your fighting skills , why are you pretending to be servants?
we're after vampires .
he's right .
we suspect that all these corpses ...
... could turn into vampires , then  ridiculous
that's just a rumor ... ... to keep the bandits away .
ever since we became rich ... ... the family members never stopped fighting .
it led to the fall of our family .
never mind , i won't punish you .
lf you can help me get rid of my problems ... ... i il adopt one of you as my godson ... ... and you can carry on the family line and inherit my fortune .
i know this should have been my duty ... ... but i il also let one of you marry my daughter in law .
look no further .
i il do it .
i will restore your family's name .
are you nuts?
what did he say to the old man?
restore the glorious days .
what's that noise?
what's that noise?
where's the compass?
let's check it out .
they're here .
where are you going?
let's move .
what's going on?
what's going on?
that's jiang's house .
sasa's still there
i ve got to save her .
what about us?
let's get our tools .
this is terrible he , help me
where are you , sasa?
i m over here
move away
are you hurt?
my foot .
let me carry you .
i haven't adopted you yet how dare you carry her
why are they moving?
stop them
someone is using magic to awaken them .
who are your enemies?
enemy?
you are my enemy
get down
what was that?
a vampire
we've been hunting him for months .
i started that rumor to protect this place .
it s not a rumor anymore .
it s the vampire king .
what?
the rumors are true?
someone is controlling them , someone is calling them .
how many people know about your gold hidden in the storage room?
who are you?
how do you know about my hiding place?
i ....
we ....
i see .
you and the other three are all after my money
lf i were , i wouldn't have come back to rescue her
liar you just want her and my gold
not bad .
i understand , you're a decoy so your friends can steal my gold right?
lf someone is plundering your gold right now , it's not my friends .
go check it out
what are you holding a rock for?
i was just trying to help .
take me out of here .
please .
but , master jiang ...?
you don't want me to be here forever , do you?
of course not .
let's go
where are we going?
this is a powerful vampire .
we must keep going , maybe we'll get away .
he's behind us
we seem to have lost him .
you can let go now .
it s all right .
i feel better now .
you can open your eyes now .
where are we?
this is where we found the vampire king .
we took a wrong turn
run
this way
he's there
marry me if i survive .
i will .
thank you , sasa .
goodbye
mas
he can't see you if you're wet
he's coming
run run
oh , no the jacket's too short
stay in the water and you'll be safe
jump into the well okay
what now , master?
there's no water here
get ready .
master , it's raining i know .
i m sure it's in here .
this is the only place i ve never been in .
i bet the old man must have hidden the gold here .
why were you making us run around till now?
will the old man be back soon?
relax .
we woke up all the corpses .
it will take him forever to round them up .
we'd better hurry before he comes back .
it s too late for you now .
you married your younger sister to my son for money
that's right this was my plan all along
you can't use up all the money you have now .
be reasonable .
don't try to hold on to what you don't need .
why is it your business how i spend my money?
because we are family now .
family?
you knew where the gold is , but you still took me running around?
look out
he wants us to fight so he could grab all the money .
be careful .
we're both here to steal don't listen to him
i il be waiting for you outside .
don't worry , i won't be able to run away from you .
it s easier to take it from him than from you .
i fulfilled two wishes today .
i got what i was owed for marrying my sister into your family ... ... and i also defeated you .
which proves i m a better fighter .
look what's behind you .
i m not falling for that old trick .
look what's behind you .
look what's behind you .
look what's behind you .
i only believe in myself .
why is she not awake yet?
will she be okay?
she is tired from running around all night .
where are your partners?
they're getting ready for the vampire .
the vampire has been to many places .
many people are infected .
i followed him for months after we were separated .
then i stopped here to look for you and the vampire at the same time .
but we never saw you .
we've been looking for you for months .
who's she?
my wife .
we just got married .
while the vampire was chasing us , we
did you take advantage of her when she was vulnerable?
do you feel the smoke?
could it be fog?
fog doesn't smell .
she's burning .
this is not an ordinary wound .
this was inflicted by a vampire .
she's been infected .
she'll turn into a vampire within seven days .
maybe sooner .
you better prepare for the worst .
although we haven't known each other for long
but it's not hopeless .
really?
she might be cured by powdered coffin wood .
might be?
but you were sure just now
i said it's not hopeless , but that doesn't mean it is curable .
at least there is hope
she's calling you .
sasa , i m over here .
is there something wrong with my ears?
why does my voice sound strange?
really?
i don't think so .
master , do you think her voice is strange?
start preparing the wood .
your ears are okay .
hey ....
hey ....
where is sasa?
do she miss me?
are you young master jiang?
you sound so strange .
i ve been dead for a while .
i can hardly speak .
come here quickly and help me .
is that master tailor?
i was before .
you've been dead .
that's right , it's been some time now .
what's happening?
i thought the vampire myth was just a story ... ... but this is all real .
they are real .
we haven't known each other long ... ... but i m true to you .
jiang's zombies have all been feeding .
soon they'll turn into vampires .
but they can be destroyed if they're exposed to the sun .
master master
stop crying .
master
i m scared .
can we leave now?
let me check .
don't leave me .
do you really want to marry me?
i gave you my word .
i il never lie to you .
master
what now?
it knows we're here .
it knows we are coming after him .
master , no response .
this thing has tasted my sword before .
he's still afraid of it .
let's go
you can't come .
wait for me in a safe place in town .
no , i want to come with you .
it s too dangerous .
trust me , i will come back .
but do me a favor before i leave .
what is it?
i want to hear you say that you'll wait for me .
i il wait for you .
don't worry , i will be back .
don't touch the gold
master , it's a wired net .
be careful
i don't care what you are here for ... ... but this is where you're all going to die .
mr. jiang , it's better to rest in peace than to be one of the living dead .
there's no point in hanging on .
i want an heir for the jiang family .
this is all about face .
i need to preserve our family .
your whole life's governed by face , isn't that miserable?
dragon , you love gold , kill them all and you can have all the gold .
okay , give me the gold ... ... and you can have my sister ... ... to carry on your family legacy .
spread out

it s been feeding on master jiang and dragon .
