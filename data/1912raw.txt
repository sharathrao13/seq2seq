i'm gonna find him before the police do .
i'm gonna find the man , and i'm gonna kill him .
did you say something , mr. markum?
the notice .
katherine markum ... ... beloved daughter of james and marita , deceased ... ... stepdaughter of annabeth , sister to
sister to sara and nadine .
you guys again?
yeah .
we're like two bad pennies .
you dropping in on jimmy?
yeah .
do you have some kind of , what , break in the case?
no , just paying our respects .
where you off to?
annabeth got a craving for cigarettes .
i'm gonna go get some .
see you in a minute .
by the way , mr. boyle , what happened to your hand there?
garbage disposal .
it jammed , i stuck my hand in , it started again .
stupid .
painful .
garbage disposal .
bullshit .
yeah .
well , it doesn't mean he killed anybody either .
come on .
heard you could use one .
thanks .
i quit 10 years ago , you believe this?
whatever you need right now .
come on in , i'll get jimmy .
i got a couple errands i gotta run .
i'll be back in an hour .
you don't have to come back , celeste .
i'll be fine .
sure?
celeste boyle?
yeah .
i'm sean devine , an old friend of dave's .
this is whitey powers .
mrs. boyle .
nice to meet you .
look , i gotta go .
oh , damn it .
i left my report pad in the cruiser .
you better go get it .
yeah .
come on .
hey , celeste , could i ask you a quick question?
me?
what time did dave get home on saturday?
what?
it's a little thing .
we're running a time line on everything involving katie .
i'm sure ... ... dave told you he saw her at mcgill's .
you think dave killed katie?
oh , no .
god .
i didn't say that .
why would i even think that?
i don't know .
no , no .
it's just that we could figure out ... ... what time she was on the road if we knew what time dave got home .
see , it's 5 minutes from your place to mcgill's ... ... and katie left 15 minutes before dave did .
you see what i mean .
i was asleep .
saturday night , when dave came in , i was asleep .
okay .
well , thanks .
bullshit .
no , he was dating katie , jim .
they were gonna elope to vegas .
we found tickets under their names .
brendan harris confirmed it .
remember what you said?
how she looked at you on saturday like she was preparing to never see you again?
did brendan harris kill my daughter?
no .
you're 100 percent sure?
passed his poly with flying colors , plus it seemed to me like he really loved her .
jimmy , i'm just curious , man .
why are you so dead set against that kid?
he said katie told him you'd disowned her if she ever dated a harris .
i knew his father .
they called him " just ray " harris .
why is that?
there were so many rays in the neighborhood .
you had " crazy ray " bucheck , " psycho ray " dorian .
the cool names were taken , so he got stuck with " just ray .
we never got along .
i flat out didn't like him .
and he cut out on his wife when she was pregnant with that little mute of hers .
i don't know .
i just figure the apple doesn't fall far from the tree .
i didn't want brendan or any other harris dating katie or any other daughter of mine .
i can't believe we're talking about just ray harris .
how about this?
we've interviewed witnesses ... ... canvassed people who were in the bar .
we've run into more than a few of them who were questioned ... ... before us by one or more of the savage brothers .
so?
so the savages are not policemen , jim .
some people don't talk to policemen , sean .
with all due respect ... ... and just so we're clear , this is our case .
how long?
how long what?
how long before you catch my daughter's killer?
you bargaining with us?
bargaining?
you giving us a deadline?
we'll speak for katie , mr. markum .
if that's okay with you .
just find my daughter's killer , sergeant .
i'm not standing in your way .
the last thing we need is markum and the savages putting the fear of god ...
... into the neighborhood .
we grew up terrified of them .
eleven months apart , like their mother ran a loose cannon factory .
fucking knuckleheads .
ballistics are in on the markum murder .
yeah , you got a match?
you're gonna love it .
it's a perfect match .
gun was a . 38 smith .
part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer in new hampshire in 1982 .
the same gun that killed katherine markum was used in a liquor store holdup in 1984 .
ln buckingham .
the flats?
rome basin .
place called looney liquors .
i pulled the file .
it was a two man job .
they fired a warning shot into a wall .
that's where the bullet got pulled .
nice work .
thought you'd like that .
it's okay , ray .
don't worry about it .
ma said that?
that i'm better off?
i loved her !
you know what that's like?
huh?
i'm sorry .
no , you're wrong .
i won't ever feel that again .
right there .
went in through a bottle of jack and stuck in the wall right there .
scary , huh?
scarier than a glass of milk , right?
so take me through it .
these two guys come in ....
in rubber masks .
they came in through here .
that's the storeroom .
there's a door back there that leads to a loading dock .
i always keep that door locked .
so they must have had a key .
a key?
so , what you're saying is that it was an inside job?
it had to be .
one of them , at least , worked for me at some point .
the only reason they fired that goddamn warning shot was they must have known ... ... i kept this under the counter .
and you told the police that at the time .
yeah .
sure , they went through my employment records .
questioned everybody who used to work for me .
never made an arrest .
still have a copy of those records?
yeah , it's in a box in the office there .
but i know who did it .
oh , yeah?
this guy i fired a couple of weeks before .
son of a bitch came in here a few days after the robbery .
he had this fucking goddamn grin on his face .
and i just knew .
go tell a grin to a jury , right?
you remember his name?
do i look senile to you?
no , sir .
name ... ... was ray harris .
we used to call him " just ray .
you say they used the same gun for another crime?
that's correct , sir .
thanks for your help , mr. looney .
where you been?
out .
what you watching?
some vampire movie .
guy just got his head torn off .
where'd you go , celeste?
i was sitting in my car ... ... down by the channel .
you know ... ... thinking about things .
what'd you think about?
oh , you know ....
no , actually , i don't know .
things .
you know , the day .
about katie being dead .
and poor annabeth and jimmy , you know ... ... those things .
those things .
know what i was thinking about , huh?
vampires .
what about them?
they're undead ... ... but i think maybe there's something beautiful about it .
maybe one day you wake up and you forget what it's like ... ... to be human .
maybe then it's okay .
what the fuck you talking about , dave?
vampires , sweetie .
werewolves .
you're not making any sense .
you think i killed katie?
celeste .
what?
ls that the sense we're making these days?
where'd you come up with that?
you've barely looked at me since you found out katie was dead .
in fact , you seem repulsed by me .
dave !
what?
i don't think anything .
i'm confused , okay?
even your friend sean asked about
he's not my friend , if you didn't know .
he asked me about you .
what time you came home .
what'd you tell him?
i said i was asleep .
that's good thinking , baby .
jesus christ , dave !
why don't you tell them about the mugger?
the mugger?
the mugger !
i see how your mind's working .
i do .
i come home with blood on me the same night katie's murdered .
i must have killed her , right?
fuck !
henry ....
what?
henry?
henry and george .
i never told anyone that before .
those were their names .
isn't that fucking hilarious?
at least that's what they called themselves , but ... ... they were wolves , and dave ... ... was the boy who escaped from wolves .
what are you talking about , dave?
i'm talking henry and george .
they took me on a four day ride .
they buried me in this ratty old cellar with a sleeping bag .
and , man , celeste ... ... did they have their fun .
and no one came to help old dave then .
dave had to pretend to be somebody else .
you mean , all those years ago ... ... when you were a little boy?
dave ....
dave's dead .
i don't know who came out of that cellar , but it sure as shit wasn't dave !
you see , honey
fuck !
it's like vampires .
once it's in you ... ... it stays .
what stays?
did you know there were child prostitutes in rome basin?
what?
fuck !
i can't trust my mind anymore , celeste .
i'm warning you ... ... i can't trust my mind .
i gotta go out , try to get my head around it .
okay .
okay .
okay .
the gun sends us in a different direction .
i don't see it that way .
what does just ray's gun have to do with dave?
these things get passed around .
just ray may have blown town , but his gun never did .
i say we talk with brendan harris in the morning .
and i say dave boyle .
the hand story .
the wife , she's definitely scared .
they're hiding something , but dave boyle's as much a killer as brendan harris .
boyle fits the profile , a fucking t.
mid 30s , white , marginally employed ... ... sexually abused as a kid .
on paper , this guy should be in jail already .
katie markum was not sexually abused , see?
in that equation , sexual emission is part of the deal .
you were friends when you were kids .
this makes you a fucking liability .
he's not my friend .
turns out you're right , i'll have my cuffs off my hip faster than yours .
hey , jimmy .
you're out late .
yeah , you too .
it's cold , huh?
yeah , i guess .
you know , i ....
i been sitting out here ... ... over the last few years ... ... waiting on katie to get back from someplace .
about midnight , i'd say to annabeth , " i'm gonna go sit on the porch for a while .
weird thing is ... ... it seemed to bring her back .
i saw her , you know .
saw who?
katie .
i was at mcgill's saturday night .
you saw katie saturday night?
never got around to telling you .
did you talk to her?
just nodded hello at one point .
next time i looked up , she was gone .
but ... ... jimmy ... ... she looked ... ... happy .
i got more walking to do .
good night .
you stole his car .
his car was officially towed .
from the front of his house .
no !
it was abandoned in rome basin ... ... adjacent to the parkway .
lucky for us , the parkway's state jurisdiction .
some kids jacked the car ...
... they took it for a joy ride ....
what?
why'd you do it?
after i left you last night , i decided to talk to boyle myself , put some fear into him .
i get to his house , i decide to look in his car , see what he's got .
i find blood .
blood?
front seat of dave's car .
b negative .
how much?
a bit .
found more in the trunk .
a lot more .
type o , same type as katie markum .
wait , katie markum never got in anybody's trunk .
she was chased through the park where she died .
it's enough to ask questions .
your search is gonna get tossed out .
no , found and abandoned in state jurisdiction , for insurance purposes .
ln the best interest of the owner .
get a physical search , file the report .
bingo .
you wanna talk to him , or should i send him home?
dave's here?
i've had him in the box for an hour .
sent two of my biggest , ugliest troopers to pick him up .
come on , mr. boyle !
we know you didn't get that swollen hand sticking it in the garbage disposal .
oh , yeah?
how do you know that?
why's your wife afraid of you?
she know what really happened to your hand?
how about a sprite or something?
how about you tell us what really happened saturday night , mr. boyle?
you lied .
that's your opinion , which you're entitled to .
hey , you think this is funny?
no , i don't .
i'm tired , i'm hung over .
not only was my car stolen last night , but now you won't release it to me .
okay .
all right .
tell us , mr. boyle , how did you get the blood in your car?
what blood?
let's start with the front seat .
what are you looking at him for?
hey , you think i could get that sprite , sean?
sure .
oh , i get it .
you're the good cop .
how about a meatball sub while you're at it?
i ain't your bitch , dave .
looks like you'll have to wait .
yeah , but you're someone's bitch , aren't you , sean?
the blood on your front seat , dave .
answer the sergeant .
we got a chainlink fence in our back yard .
me and my kid play wiffle ball every afternoon after school .
he's getting good , so most of the balls are on the other side of the fence .
so i climb it .
except i slip ... ... slice myself where the links curl in , right here .
bled like hell .
ten minutes later , i gotta pick up michael at school .
probably was still bleeding when i got in the front seat .
what blood type are you?
b negative .
yeah?
that's the match we got .
well , there you go .
not quite .
blood in the trunk of the car wasn't b negative .
i don't know anything about any blood in the trunk .
no idea how half a pint of blood got in the trunk?
none .
this is not the way you wanna go , dave .
how will that look in court?
you not knowing how someone else's blood got in the trunk of your car?
gonna look fine , i suppose .
you filed the report .
what report?
the stolen car report .
the car wasn't in my possession last night .
so whatever the thieves used it for , you should find out ... ... because it sounds like they were up to no good .
things looking any better on the sprite , sean?
well , you just got too fucking smart .
the car is inadmissible .
anything there , his lawyers say was put by thieves .
i can break him .
he just kicked our asses !
you still think dave wouldn't hurt a fly
ls that the point?
no .
what is the point?
we can break this open on the gun .
it's the gun .
okay .
maybe .
so , what do we do with dave?
fuck it .
kick him loose .
maybe a celtic cross .
that's always a popular choice .
or this lovely red marble here .
or a figural .
that one .
very good .
nice and simple .
hey , jimmy !
annabeth said you were here .
we been asking around , like you said to .
yeah?
yeah .
jimmy , this ain't about the two year bit you did for me .
and it ain't about me missing your brains running things .
katie was my niece .
not by birth , but she was part of our family , we loved her .
i don't question you , val .
what's up?
cops are all over this .
doing their job for once .
bars , street trade , everything .
every hooker we talked to , bartender , already been questioned .
the fucking law has descended , jimmy .
what about just ray's kid?
quiet as a mouse .
kid's no trouble to anyone .
i talked to diane and eve .
they said he loved her .
jimmy , they said that she loved him .
want us to take a run at him?
no .
hold off for now .
anything else?
what?
val , you wanna spit something , spit it .
tell him .
sean devine and his partner went by and saw dave boyle .
dave was at mcgill's .
probably questioning him like everybody else .
i heard something else this morning too .
two staties came by in uniform .
maybe they forgot to ask him something .
no .
when they left , they took him with them .
they put him in the back seat , if you know what i mean .

slick as hell , man .
ran a crew , never got arrested .
so did harris ever testify in open court?
never went .
markum dummied up on the guys he was working with ... ... da was afraid he wouldn't be able to convict .
so he cut a deal .
two years inside , couple more suspended .
so jimmy markum never knew that ray harris ratted him out?
ray harris disappeared about two months ... ... after markum rotated back into the free world .

okay .
i don't know , jim .
i might have left dave for good .
you left dave?
yeah .
well ... ... he's been acting kind of nuts lately .
i'm almost afraid of him .
do you know something?
i know he was taken in by the cops this morning .
he saw katie the night she was murdered .
didn't tell me ... ... till after the cops questioned him .
i know he's got a hand that looks like it's been punching a fucking wall .

what?
your father , ray sr.
you remember him .
i was 6 when he left us .
so you don't remember the guy?
i remember little things .
he smelled like schlitz and dentyne .
he ....
he what?
he carried a lot of change in his pocket .
it jingled when he walked .
you could always hear him coming home .
and if i guessed how much he had , even if i was close , he'd give it to me .
you remember your father having a gun?
no .
well , you seem awfully sure for somebody who was 6 when he left .
what's up?
what's that?
this is what you asked for .
css reports , ballistics , fingerprint analysis , the 911 tape .
bunch of stuff .
all right , thanks .
we were talking about your father's gun .
i told you , my father didn't have a gun .
oh , well , i guess we were misinformed .
when was the last time you talked to him?
never .
never?
he went out for a drink and never came back .
but your mother never filed a missing person's report .
why not?
because he's not missing .
he sends money every month .
sends money?
five hundred bucks every month .
like clockwork .
from where?
postmark says brooklyn .
how do you know it's him?
who else would it be?
who else would send it?
my ma says that's the way he was .
do something shitty , then he'd try to make up for it .
why do you keep asking me if my father had a gun?
you know why , kid .
no , i don't .
gun that killed your girlfriend ... ... was the same gun your father used in a robbery 18 years ago .
so ... ... you wanna tell me about it?
my father didn't have a gun .

i don't know .
maybe just ray is still alive .
eighty grand .
i mean ... ... who else is gonna send that kind of money if not the father?
listen , go home , have a drink .
let it go for a while .
yeah .
hey , anything good on the 911?

there's , like , this car with blood in it , and the door's open .
what's the location of the car?
sydney street .

son , what's your name?
he wants to know her name .
he said , " her name .
she's a dead girl , you refer to her as a she .
how does the kid know?

tie him up , rob him , we're out .
here .
it was me , nicky and this kid carson leverett .
fucking carson .
i swear , this kid couldn't tie his own fucking shoe if you didn't show him .
we all wear suits because we want to fit in .
we're in the elevator , it stops , this old lady gets on .
she starts fucking screaming !
now val turns to me , but i'm looking at carson .
i'm thinking , " what the fuck?
because that fucking bonehead's still got his ronald reagan mask on !
fucking smiley mask !
idiot !
and you guys didn't notice till then?
shit like that happened all the time on jobs .
that's why jimmy was so missed .
he saw shit happen before it even went down .
why do you think he went straight?
one word , pure and simple .
katie .
what about you guys?
what?
us?
going straight?
that's pretty fucking funny !
we're like bats , we like the night too much .
days are just good for sleeping through .

the way it should be , nobody to bother you in this life .
no one fucking with you or your loved ones .

this guy's a hoot .
he can really get you going .
yeah .
oh , yeah , my man dave .
kevin , will you bring us a bottle?

thanks , kevin .
remember we took ray harris here that time?
everybody called this guy " just ray , " but val here called him " ray jingles .
this guy walked around with 10 bucks in change ... ... in case he had to make a call to lraq or something .
are you all right , dave?
dave?
you all right?
shit .
i'm gonna be sick .
come on .
come on , now .
dave , use the back door .
huey don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims .
hey , ray .
you guys come to make sure i didn't fall in?
come here a second .
sit down .
let me tell you about ray harris .
he was a buddy of mine .
he used to visit me in prison .
he checked in on marita and katie , my mother , if they needed anything .
he's also the one who put me in .
he ratted me out .
that's terrible .
my wife had cancer at the time .
i remember .
ray robbed me of being with her ... ... when she was dying .
the death part you do alone , but i could have helped her with the dying .
why are you telling me this?
i knelt ray down over there and i shot him twice , in his throat and chest .
we were both crying when i did it .
jimmy
he was begging .
you know , pregnant wife , little brendan .
he said he knew me .
he said i was a good man .
what do you think , dave?
you think i'm a good man?
who do you hate?
come on , who?
no one .
what is it you think i did?
as i was holding him under the water ... ... i could feel god watching me , shaking his head .
not angry ... ... but like if a puppy shit on a rug .
who do you love?
you love me .
what about ma?
you love me so much , i wanna hear you say it .
you think i killed katie , don't you?
don't talk , dave .
don't talk .
no , i killed someone , but i didn't kill katie .
this is the mugger story .
he wasn't a mugger , a child molester .
he was having sex with this kid in his car .
he was a fucking wolf !
he was a vampire !
get out of here .

a dream of youth .

the dream , yeah .
you'd know what i mean if you'd got in that car instead of me .

we bury our sins here , dave .

this part , you do alone .
tough night?

we got them , jim .

katie's killers .

killers , plural .
yeah , kids , actually .
ray harris 'son ray jr . and another kid , john o'shea .
they just confessed a couple hours ago .
no doubt?
none .
why?
they don't know .
they were playing with a gun , saw a car coming ... ... one of the kids lies down in the street , car swerves , clutch kicks out .
katie .
o'shea says they just meant to scare her and the gun went off .
but she hit him with her door , ran ... ... and they chased her so she wouldn't tell anyone .
and the beating they gave her?
ray jr . had a hockey stick .
all right .
go easy .
take a breath .
look at me .
look at me , jimmy .
i got a call from celeste boyle .
she was hysterical .
says dave's missing , says you might know where he is .
we need to talk to him .
boston p. d. found the body of a guy in the woods behind mcgill's .
a body?
the body of a guy?
yeah , a pedophile with three priors .
they want to talk to dave about it .
so , jimmy ... ... when was the last time you saw dave?
the last time i saw dave .
yeah .
dave boyle .
dave boyle .
yeah , jimmy .
dave boyle .
that was 25 years ago , going up this street in the back of that car .
jimmy , what did you do?
thanks for finding my daughter's killers , sean .
if only you'd been a little faster .
are you gonna send celeste boyle 500 a month too?
sometimes i think ....
i think all three of us got in that car .
and all of this is just a dream , you know?
a dream , sure .
in reality ... ... we're still 11 year old boys locked in a cellar ... ... imagining what our lives would have been if we'd escaped .
maybe you're right .
who the fuck knows?
yeah , this is sean .
i'm sorry .
i need you to know that .
i pushed you away .
i'm sorry too .
things have been so messed up .
loving you , hating you .
come home?
you change the locks or anything?
no .
no , everything is just the way you left it .
nora .
what's that?
nora .
that's our daughter's name , sean .
nora , huh?
well , i like that .
nora .
i killed dave .
i killed him , and i threw him in the mystic .
but i killed the wrong man .
that's what i've done .
and i can't undo it .
jimmy .
i wanna feel your heart .
last night ... ... when i put the girls to bed , i told them how big your heart was .
i told them how much you loved katie ...
annabeth . ... because you created her .
and sometimes , your love for her was so big ...
... felt like your heart was gonna explode  please stop .
i told them their daddy loved them that much too .
that he had four hearts , and they were all filled up ... ... and aching with a love that meant we would never have to worry .
and that their daddy would do whatever he had to for those he loved .
and that is never wrong .
that can never be wrong , no matter what their daddy had to do .
and those girls fell asleep at peace .
you said , " last night . " you knew?
celeste called , looking for you .
she was worried something might happen .
she told me about dave .
told me what she told you .
what kind of wife ... ... says that about her husband?
and why'd she run to you?
why didn't you call?
because it's like i told the girls .
their daddy's a king .
and a king knows what to do and does it .
even when it's hard .
and their daddy will do whatever he has to for those he loves .
and that's all that matters .
because everyone is weak , jimmy .
everyone but us .
we will never be weak .
and you ....
you could rule this town .
and after , jimmy ... ... iet's take the girls down to the parade .
katie would have liked that .
