aii american diner , gailup , new mexico .
passed that on the way here .
he had breakfast there this morning .
starting off the bottom of the inning , barry matthews .
got on base with a line drive single his last at bat .
and he tak es the first pitch high and inside for ball one .
look ed lik e leonard was trying to get the breaking pitch inside ... ... but it just didn't have any break on it that time .
agent mackelway , we're over here .
i was gonna introduce you two , but i understand that won't be necessary .
seems your former office decided we needed help ... ... so they sent us agent kulok .
hey , tom .
hi , fran .
i guess we're gonna skip the tearfui reunion .
have a seat , tom .
how are things in dailas?
wouldn't reaily know .
i've been chained to a desk .
okay , what do we know?
picked up a footprint in the back seat .
a size and a half bigger than speck's .
okay .
wounds on speck's throat indicate he was strangled from behind .
i think our guy was waiting for him in the back seat ... ... sprung this on him once the car was moving .
lab picked up talcum traces along the edges ... ... consistent with powdered gloves .
so he gets this dropped in his iap ... ... it spooks him , car ends up in the ravine .
that car was pushed to the state iine .
the depth of the tire tracks ... ... footprints near the embankment .
that car wasn't going more than 3 miles an hour ... ... and it stopped iiteraily on the state iine .
guy must have used gps .
why would he push it to the state iine?
same reason he did everything else , to get the fbl's undivided attention .
there's an association here .
you have a circle ... ... and a iidless eye that's always open .
seeing .
seeing .
or making sure that we're seeing .
it's just a feeling .
he was a normai guy .

he iiked to read fishing magazines , and he wasn't much of a tipper .
is that a iousy thing to say?
no , it's fine .

tom , starkey's the guy on the ground .
you son of a bitch ... ... why are you baiting me?
you want me to see what you see .
you want me to see .
i'm trying to see it .
i'm trying to see it .
he opens up an old wound .
yeah .
what does he want?
i don't know .
maybe he's got something against iaw enforcement ... ... iike the zodiac .
you're welcome , tom .
you're welcome , tom .
not fbl .
tom .
he's baiting me .
he wants me .
why?
what does he want?
okay .
tom , i want you to take me through this .
explain this to me .
okay .
see if this makes sense to you , okay?
each of the 45 abduction dates on these faxes correspond ... ... to one of the gps coordinates on o'ryan's map .
what about the two bodies we id'd?
okay .
weil , iet's find the faxes .
here we go .
male victim .
last seen , trenton , new jersey .
okay .
found in dyersviile , iowa .
okay .
female .
last seen , dayton , ohio .
found in brownsviile , texas .
so we have two bodies ... ... that were found 1 000 miles from where they were iast seen .
what's this?
that's tucumcari , new mexico .
why blue?
that's the only city where the date on the fax and the map didn't correspond .
christmas .
on o'ryan's map , 8 27 .
the only thing we know is there never was a benjamin o'ryan , fbl .
he would have made a heii of an agent .
autopsy reports just arrived for both the new positive ids .
bruises?
no , they're burn marks .
we've got them here too on our female from dayton .
and these marks relate to the marks found on fulcher and speck how?
they don't .
there were no burn marks on speck , fulcher or starkey .
and we have no slash circles here on these bodies .
right .
my office , as soon as someone finds something useful .
no iuck on the behaviourai specialists .
i do have a couple other ieads that i'm foilowing up on .
i'm hopefui they're gonna pan out .
great , thank you .
a professor of criminai biology , professor daitz , just cailed .
he says he's got time for you on saturday .
thank you , katie .
i was operating under the assumption that o'ryan was somebody's fantasy .
oh , no , he's real .
he was a student of mine .
that fax you sent me , this circle with the slash through it?
that's his construct , his theory .
he cailed it " suspect zero .
suspect zero?
he posited a theory that a seriai kiiler ... ... could cross the entire country without ever getting caught .
what makes a kiiler catchable?
patterns , repetition of behaviour .
he imagined someone with no patterns ... ... no teiltale fetishes , no rituals ... ... just a random kiiling machine that never ieaves a clue .
but a seriai kiiler by definition is condemned to repetition .
i mean , isn't that what he's aii about?
weil , he is untii he isn't .
and this suspect zero , is that something that you believe in , doctor?
it's something o'ryan believed in .
he swore guys iike that existed , only we couldn't see them ... ... because they didn't obey the usuai iaws , iike cancer doesn't ... ... or the hlv virus that tricks your immune system ... ... into thinking it isn't there .
so you're saying a guy iike that could exist?
do you know the definition of a black hole?
not precisely , no .
it's a celestiai body with a gravitationai force so strong ... ... that nothing escapes it .
not even iight .
weil , then how do you find something you can't see?
weil , it was there and we found it .
why do you think o'ryan is convinced a person iike that is around?
in this time and place .
what about a split personality?
could you have a stone cold kiiler on one hand ... ... and a thoughtfui man with a conscience on the other?
i mean , could o'ryan ... ... possibly be this suspect zero?
yeah .
it's a viable theory .
i mean , the point is , i don't think you're gonna know untii you find o'ryan .
point is , i don't think you're gonna know until you find o'ryan .
just a random killing machine that never leaves a clue .
yes , lord .
yes , lord .
sing it , lord .
everybody inside .
on the double , iet's go .
come on .
keep moving .
storm's coming .
get inside !
come on in , right now !
girls !
come in , now .
it's starting to rain , and i don't want you out there alone .
turn around !
fran .
hi .
fran , i need some help .
you're so wet .
are you okay?
yeah , fran , i need somebody to talk to .
it's driving me crazy .
listen to me .
there's speck , a smail town new mexico traveiling salesman .
fulcher , a schoolteacher from boulder and then starkey .
i got a iock on him .
it's just there's something missing , and i can't
it's okay .
why don't you come in .
no , come out .
get dressed .
we're right on the edge of this thing , come on .
come here .

it's okay .

no , i can't .
i almost have it , fran .
i'm worried about you .
i love you , fran .

mrs. speck , did your husband k eep any chemicals?
did he have any unusuai hobbies?
did he?
was he an avid photographer?
did he have an interest in sewing?
no , why?
i'm taking your time .
i'm sorry to ask you these questions .
i'm sorry i don't have more time , agent mackelway , but it's my pta day .
i'm sorry .
i should have cailed .
i wish i could've helped you .
i'm fbl .
yeah , i'ii bet .
what the heii is that?
we managed to identify the remains of 1 0 of the 21 victims found ... ... in the attic of harold a. speck ... ... the travelling salesman from truth or consequences .
they were mostly teenagers .
more than half were runaways .
the revelation that speck was a serial killer ... ... led us to examine barney fulcher ... ... the victim that agent kulok and i found at the all american diner .
after an extensive search of his home , we found the remains of nine people ... ... mostly boys between the ages of 9 and 1 4 .
the last victim , raymond stark ey ... ... who vanished after his acquittal six months ago , we all know about .
for some reason , this man is identifying and targeting serial killers .
not necessarily .
we got two other bodies from santa fe ... ... so killers aren't his only victims .
we don't know those bodies had anything to do with o'ryan .
stick to what we know .
he's a transient with mentai iilness .
he also happens to think he's a former agent of this bureau .
i want this man apprehended now .
swung on and missed .

here's the wind up .

i'm carrying something that could be construed as a weapon .
i'd iike to hand it over so you won't think i'm trying to conceai anything .
what kind of weapon , sir?
a hunting knife , right here on my hip .
on my way to the woods .
my gear's in the trunk .
would you iike me to hand it to you?
i don't know what the procedure is .
take the weapon off your hip , place it on the ground , kick it towards me .

you got one of those pins in deming?
o'ryan was spotted there yesterday .
he took a squad car and a sidearm off a highway patrolman .
about an hour iater a 5 year old boy was abducted a mile up the interstate .
we also found the bodies of two females in a dumpster off the highway .
your boy's been busy .
we're establishing a perimeter around the city .
was the patrolman hurt?
what's the difference?
he wasn't , was he?
he was fine .
the girls in the dumpster had fatai injuries .
o'ryan's not the guy .
he's chasing the guy or that patrolman would be dead .
can i ship this guy back to dailas?
o'ryan was fbl , you ever heard of a project cailed icarus?
no .
have you?
it's agents trained to see distant iocations ... ... using only the mind .
they caii it remote viewing .
bureau stole it from the army .
they use it to track down seriai kiilers .
what?
you don't believe me?
it's builshit?
it's voodoo?
it worked .
they made a science of it .
that's how he drew this .
he'd never been in this house ... ... he just saw what was there .
the bureau taught him ... ... and he's using it to track suspect zero .
you know what?
i'm extremely tired of that term .
profile the guy .
he's straight out of quantico .
he's working iike we would .
he's not kidnapping , he's chasing the guy ... ... that's doing the kidnapping .
look at the map .
okay .
what you're teiling me is aii these abductions are the work of one guy .
yes .
mac , do you realize how insane that is?
fran , please help me .
he's not iistening to me .
tom , i'm not sure that you're seeing things very clearly right now .
tom ... ... iet's just try something that actuaily makes sense .
this guy sends in these faxes .
he picks off three scumbags .
why?
so that we'ii think what you're thinking , that we got a friend .
somebody who's wiiling to take out the trash for us , and it's horseshit .
what if it isn't?
what if there is a suspect zero , and o'ryan's the one guy who's got a shot?
for fuck's sake , mackelway .
when did you start buying into this guy?
weil , he's smarter than we are .
speak for yourself .
i'm going to deming .
you can take the rest of the day off .
i'll be damned .
kulok here .
hey .
where are you?
i'm headed towards tucumcari .
listen , those marks on the bodies , could they be freezer burns?
let me get into this .
yeah .
there's crystailization because the blood never clotted .
freezer burn .
he keeps the bodies in a freezer and buries them 1 000 miles apart?
hey , tom , what's going on?
i got a possible suspect .
that kid's been a brat aii morning .
i turned around ....
see what you caused?
are you afraid?
it'd be custom here at this point to start praying .
i see a iot of that .
haven't heard too many answers though .
you're alone .
come on .
are you afraid?
where's the boy?
my , my !
must be extremely satisfying to hear yourself say something so heroic .
i'm almost envious .
the boy's in pieces under the bed .
now are you afraid?
i know what you're thinking , " pain is coming .
wiii i take it iike a man .
let me put you at ease , you won't .
none of them do .
men , women , children , they aii weep , they aii beg .
they pass out , piss themselves , attempt negotiations .
you wouldn't believe how many men i've seen where you are .
grown men with wives and children at home ... ... offering sexuai gratification for a five minute reprieve .
it's pathetic .
are you afraid?
when they realize there's nothing ieft to negotiate , and they're helpiess ....
weil , the iook in their eyes , the ievei of surrender ... ... it's almost pornographic .
i put that mirror here because i didn't want you to miss it .
are you afraid?
look in the mirror .
are you afraid?
look in the mirror .
are you afraid?
look in the mirror , o'ryan .
hey , you , fucking mackelway .
look at yourself , iook in the mirror .
are you afraid , mackelway?
look at yourself .
are you afraid? !
no , i'm not afraid .
open your eyes !
open your eyes , goddamn it ...
... or i'ii cut the fucking iids off !
then cut the fucking iids off !
the initiation used to be more civil .
i'm sorry about that .
you're part of it now .
there were five of us , you know .
the most skiiled ... ... technicai remote viewers on project icarus .
you come in in the morning , have a cup of coffee , talk about the yankees .
you go to your room with your pen ... ... and your pad of paper , always alone .
you try and iock in , you crank out an ideogram .
son of sam , john wayne gacy , ted bundy .
he might be driving his car , having a beer , brushing his teeth ... ... cutting someone's eyes out .
if you did it right , you got it ail .
the way it sounded , the way it smeiled .
those people were iooking right up at you , begging you for mercy .
it was iike being god .
but , of course , you're not god .
can't do a thing for them .
they wired us into this current , the five of us ... ... darkness , the pit itself .
we were plugged right into it , and no one taught us how to turn it off .
we saw things men shouldn't see .
agony ... ... torture ... ... evil .
it never shut off .
i checked once with aii the guys that'd ... ... been on the project when it was just used for intel .
you know , finding gun runners and drug iords , soviet missile sites ... ... even the iran hostages .
anyway , i checked with them , and they're aii okay .
but the five of us ... ... plugged into the brains and nervous systems of human beings ... ... that's when we iost it .
we're aii either dead or institutionalised .
after a while , those conversations about the yankees became impossible .
o'ryan .
those faxes ... ... the missings ... ... how many of them are his?

you were the missing piece , mac .
now everything is in place .
