lyekka?
kai?
kai , kai , i can't find lyekka anywhere and i , er
look , i think we're being attacked .
by whom?
well , i don't know , does it matter?
look kai i hate to break the news to you , but you're not a plant !
you're a brunnen g warrior , and then you became an assassin for the divine order , you're not meant to rot in a garden !
so get up out of there and kill !
may i help you?
what's happening?
we are being attacked .
i know that , but by who?
balloons .
from fire?
likely .
lyekka !
stan .
no .
i just wanted to make you happy stan .
you have you do !
listen , lyekka , are you ok?
i didn't see them coming .
stan?
yes?
i have to say goodbye now .
no no no no no , we have to take you back to the lexx and we can fix you up .
you make me happy .
i'll always be in your heart .
if you cry , you'll lose the memory of our love .
no .
she is dead .
no !
yes .
and stanley , you are in danger .
i can protect you , but i cannot protect you and the moth and xev at the same time unless you stay together .
yeah .
i guess you're right .
where's xev?
xev !
they've got the moth !
xev !
xev !
can you reach it?
yes , i can .
kai?
yes?
i'm coming with you .
hang on .
xev?
kai , you fly , i'll help xev .
xev , is that you?
it is xev .
xev , xev?
i don't get it .
let's go .
where?
out .
a moth , it doth go boom .
a moth , it doth descend .
kai and stanley assumed that you would be in the moth , exactly as i had anticipated .
it was an excellent plan .
clever .
brilliant .
insightful .
genius .
stupid !
stupid?
do you doubt me , xev?
kai can't be killed , he's already dead .
but stanley can .
and kai does not float .
correct?
my prince thinks of everything .
so , we have you , and stanley and your dead man are out of the picture , isn't that excellent?
wonderful .
satisfying .
exciting .
inevitable .
evil .
i won't disagree with that .
that's what we do .
we're bad .
it's our job .
our lives .
our commitment .
we're the opposite of good .
anything but .
you see xev , that's what fire is all about .
it's the repository of all that is not good .
precisely .
don't you have a mind of your own?
oooo ...
no .
am i beautiful?
the most .
witty?
the sharpest .
do you love me?
completely .
would you die for me?
in an instant .
i think i'm going to be sick .
you see xev , priest lives on fire and i am its ruler .
and he knows that the least hint of disobedience would mean an immediate return to terrible pain and suffering , and as you know
i'm very good with pain .
however , as he is my priest , he does not suffer much for now , at least .
my prince we have a problem .
the sky's full of balloons .
they're everywhere .
they're all around us .
and one of them likely contains xev .
xev !
can you hear us?
kai !
that was xev , did you hear that?
xev !
we can hear you !
xev , where are you?
now the game will become more interesting .
a challenge .
a test .
a contest .
a battle .
which you will lose .
a defeat .
a defeat?
for them .
victory for us .
precisely .
you see xev
flying a balloon
flying a balloon is not a science .
it's not an art .
there's a lot of luck involved .
sometimes you get an updraft
sometimes you don't
you never know .
but if you have a lot of balloons
as we do .
then you're more likely to get a favourable wind than if you have only one .
it's a simple matter of mathematics .
in order to destroy their balloon , our balloons must rise higher .
or at least one of them must .
what?
rise above all the others .
we need to shed some weight .
her?
no .
thank you !
we need you more than we need them .
you could be useful .
we gotta make it to another one of those cities .
don't you want to rescue xev?
well , yeah kai , but we gotta get some help first .
i have observed that the residents of the various cities on water suffer from
or perhaps , benefit from a certain complacency in relation to the potential dangers they face .
yeah .
they seem to live for the minute , in a kind of continuum , and will likely show no interest in our problem .
ok , what do you suggest then?
engage the other balloons in battle , to save xev now on our own .
but what but they're all around us , how can we attack them all?
we will not have to attack them .
they appear to be organising themselves to attack us .
oh , come on , there's way too many .
they're gonna beat us .
likely you are correct .
ok , i'm correct .
what are we gonna do?
whatever we can .
you know kai , that's easy for you to say because you're an assassin .
you see , i'm a security guard class 4 , formerly an assistant deputy backup courier .
you know , doing battle's not part of my nature .
you are captain of the lexx , the mightiest weapon in the two universes what's left of them and have been so for more than four thousand years .
they seek advantage by rising above us , so they are shedding weight to gain in altitude .
i'm pumping this thing as hard as i can .
did they hit us?
not where it matters .
they are not trying to hit the gondola .
their strategy is to puncture our balloon's bag and make us descend .
make sure they all stay out of range of his weapon .
excellent plan .
would you care for a drink?
very well .
i won't bother to offer you one again .
they're rising above us .
correct .
well what can we do?
we can wait .
wait for what?
for them to make a mistake .
that's our entire plan?
yes .
yeah , well what if they don't make a mistake?
then they will succeed and we will fail .
what does that mean?
it means , that you will die
and i will sink to the centre of this planet .
why is it that i do all the pumping and you do all the standing around?
i will pump if you request , but then i will not be able to stop darts .
oh , that's ok , i like to pump .
did they get the balloon?
not yet .
close .
you seem so far away from me now and we used to be so close .
we were never close .
i remember your kisses well .
they were warm and close .
i was vulnerable , and you took advantage of me .
there was nothing real .
i see hate in your eyes .
you should be one of mine , you should be with me .
if you can hate me , you should be able to hate others .
it's a small step for you to take .
take it xev .
be mine .
no .
why do you do this?
i tempt those who can be tempted , and i punish those who deserve to be punished .
that is my function , my occupation , my job my joy .
what is wrong with that?
and i also punish some who have done nothing wrong , who slip through the cracks but then , no system is perfect .
you may not understand why i do what i do , but even less do i understand why you make the choices that you do .
i can see into you , xev .
i can see things inside you that even you do not consciously remember .
you have every reason to hate .
good baby .
good baby .
good baby .
good baby .
good baby xev of b3k .
good food .
good food .
good food baby xev of b3k .
do you remember that?
your childhood , xev of b3k?
no .
but you were raised in a box .
i was raised in the wife bank on b3k , yes .
but i really don't remember much of it .
there was not much about it to remember .
we've been hit .
we're losing altitude .
we have punctured their balloon bag .
they are going down .
soon they will be in the water and we can shoot at them at will .
we do not want that .
so what do we do?
we wait .
good morning matron .
good morning , xev of b3k .
lesson 376 .
your husband asks you " do you think i'm fat?
what is the correct answer?
1 .
no !
2 .
it's not what you look like on the outside , but the man on the inside that matters to me .
3 .
i like a man with a lot of meat on his bones !
can we get naked now and play ridethe tower of power?
it's not what you look like on the outside , but the man on the inside that matters to me?
wrong !
the correct answer is i like a man with a lot of meat on his bones !
can we get naked now and play ride the tower of power?
xev of b3k always flatter your man .
never admit his failings .
use any occasion to please him in bed .
xev of b3k at this rate you will not graduate from the wife bank for 5 . 9 years .
i'll try to do better in future , matron .
do you remember that?
it's all a blur .
hard to remember exactly but also hard to forget .
so much pain .
so?
no .
should we fire everything at them now?
firing everything at them will have no effect on the dead man .
it is now time to change our strategy .
the right thing to do .
you should have come over to me xev .
never .
i once gave you the chance to let stanley tweedle destroy this planet , but you refused my chance because you are a good person
which means you are my enemy , which means you have to die .
throw her over the side .
with pleasure .
but , we will attach a piece of string to her , to improve our negotiating position .
what was that?
xev .
the time has come for you to make a deal !
he wants to make a deal , what now?
we wait for him to make a mistake .
well , he hasn't been making too many so far .
listen kai , why don't you just , you know , do the assassination thing with your brace and get this over with?
i would , if my brace were fully functional , but it is not .
what , what's the deal?
the dead man will jump over the side and sink into the sea .
unless he does that in ten seconds , priest will cut the cord on xev , and she will sink into the sea .
10 .
no .
9 .
8 .
7 ..
no !
don't do it , kai !
6 .
5 .
4 ..
no kai , don't do it .
you're our only hope .
3 .
2 .
1 ..
look !
he's climbing over the side for you .
isn't it sweet? !
no , kai !
no , kai !
why did you do that?
the ten seconds were up , so i cut the cord like you said .
i did not tell you to cut it .
i am deeply sorry , my prince .
it will not happen again but i don't know what i did wrong .
you made a mistake .
look .
kai !
bring me down to xev .
there is a faint possibility that your stupidity will lead to my opportunity .
we certainly have the advantage of height now .
thank you .
you're welcome .
oh , it's nice to see you xev .
why don't we just crash , down in the water?
in that case , i would be fine , but you and xev would become very easy targets .
kai .
kai , i hate to interrupt your meditation , but things are not looking very good for us here .
release the stays .
release the stays?
yes , we must release the stays which suspend the gondola from the balloon now .
fire everything .
we must kill them now , before they get any higher .
how can they get any higher?
fire everything !
we have to kill them now !
good move , kai .
look .
shall i release the mainstay?
yes .
the balloon's losing air .
how can we make it to the lexx?
we will have to be very lucky .
we're already slowing down .
soon we will start to drop , rapidly .
we must shed weight .
what weight?
oh no no .
look !
are you ready?
nearly .
we're losing time .
what are you doing?
i have to release the mainstay from up here or else i will go down with the gondola .
you're going down with the gondola .
i'm sorry , i'm not clear
i have no further use for you .
you're dead weight .
now please fall to your death with the gondola , and don't waste anymore time about it .
is that clear enough for you?
very clear .
you are my prince .
your mistake provided my opportunity .
their balloon is losing air , ours is not .
it will be easy to rise above them and pick them off .
you are my prince .
now get on with it .
i will get on with it !
you , you fool !
what do you think you will gain?
what else would you expect?
now i will rise to the top .
no .
and i will rule this planet !
you will suffer !
we're not gonna make it , are we?
no .
our balloon is losing too much air .
well what , what now?
look , there .
oh no .
no no no no no no .
you're not actually suggesting that i let go and throw myself down there , and if i'm incredibly lucky land on prince's balloon , are ya?
no .
no .
well that's good because , you know , i wouldn't die after i missed the balloon and hit the water , because my heart'd stop long before that .
we have to jump stan .
no xev .
i'm informing you right now that i am in no way equipped for a jump like that .
you know , my fingers won't respond to the instructions from my brain to let go .
my brain wouldn't even produce an instruction like that .
i will jump , and then i will bring you over .
well how?
no no no no .
your brace isn't working right , remember?
hopefully , you will still be close enough .
i think i must pick up stan first , then i will grab you .
ah !
i'm not ready for this xev .
you go .
captains first .
my heart's still working .
i don't believe it .
xev's balloon is outta control .
fire your brace kai , fire now !
she is out of range .
well we have to go down and get her .
we will , but in a moth .
a moth?
we don't have time .
the other balloons'll get to her first .
we are now in the divide between the atmospheres of the two planets .
xev will land on fire .
we can reach her in a moth , before the other balloons .
all night by the kai , kai .
all night by his corpse i did moan .
i dreamed he was tweaking my circuits .
while i was tweaking his bone .
do these mothbreeders ever stop?
no .
all night without kai , kai .
i'm lonely , i'm blue , and i'm sick .
i dream of his frozen kisses .
and fondling his frozen
kai !
you've come back to me !
come here , oh dark dead and delicious one .
kai !
kai , i'm here .
come back .
come back !
come back .
you'll come back .
you need me .
you're just in an awfully big hurry .
that's all .
i understand .
it's ok .
no , really , it's ok .
it's not ok !
it's not ok !
i love you kai !!!
what are you doing here?
i must build more moths .
are you one of the mothbreeders who were taken to duketown?
i must build more moths .
i know this probably doesn't mean anything to you
but like me , you were a prisoner on the cluster , and they turned you into what you are now .
but you were once a real person .
a real person who lived a real life .
can you understand that , even a little?
you were a real person !
i must build more moths .
poor you .
poor me .
you again .
me again .
how did you get here?
i died .
you don't look dead .
i'm not .
i died , and now i have been reawakened here , for you .
why?
i want to be with you when you die .
i've never seen anyone die for the first time .
what makes you think that i'm going to die?
you're on the surface of the planet fire , the sun's up you cannot last the hour .
and you?
oh , i will also die .
how sad .
not for me i'm used to it .
and it will not be so bad for you , although your friends will miss you .
do you know what a cluster lizard is?
not really .
a cluster lizard is a very nasty animal , that i think originally came from a very hot place .
how does that matter?
you will see .
when?
in less than an hour .
we'll never find her .
we will search for the balloon .
how are you going?
fine , thank you .
i'm not .
i'm hot , i have to stop .
why aren't you dying?
i'm very good with heat .
ironically , i'm not .
how is it that you're not dying?
i'm not all human .
can you still find whatever memory you want with your hand , like you did before?
yes .
think cluster lizard .
then i guess you get to see me die .
do you still feel anything for me?
a little .
you shouldn't .
i agree .
well i didn't admit it before , but i'm hot , too .
really hot .
hey , look , look , do you see it?
yes .
she's not in it .
she may be somewhere upwind .
i hope .
the dead do not hope .
yeah , well kai the living certainly do .
