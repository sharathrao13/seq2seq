the characters and events depicted in this motion picture are real .
they are based on the stories of veterans and military history .
second lieutenant jrv , is the strike group ready?
yes , we are .
i'll wait for your return with emergency troops .
the soviets 'base " the bird " must be beaten .
it's a formidable base but i have faith in you and lieutenant jrv .
i want a prisoner , alive .
good luck .
good luck .
those boys have a tough night ahead of them .
we'll dig forward .
i don't know where the guards are .
no movement above the snow !
beyond the front llne
welcome .
harry jrv's home , stockholm december 6th , 2003
so you're jeanette?
jeanette eriksson .
orvar nilsson .
we're off to the finnish embassy .
it's their independence day .
orvar helped us in the winter and continuation wars .
that was a long time ago .
come in .
this is a soviet war map .
is it a spoil of war , harry?
in summer of 1941 we took back the karelian peninsula .
as you can see , the syvri river flows from lake onega towards lake ladoga .
during the war there were two swedish speaking regiments .
i arrived at the base " the dam " in early june 1942 .
the front was quiet .
we had to get information about the enemy's intentions with reconnaissance missions .
this clay is hard like cement !
help is coming .
forss , you got a package .
take cover !
the dam " , syvri river , june 1942
fire in the hole !
there's major hedengren .
you've made a lot of progress .
tnt helps the digging .
where the hell did you get it?
we shouldn't waste our supplies !
we took it from the soviets 'mine fields .
very well then .
that swede listens to reason .
you're married to your camera .
do you sleep with it?
i don't use it in my sleep .
next week i'll take it with me to " the boil .
can i come along?
sure .
we'll give that base hell .
the commanders don't like it so close to our lines .
the boil " is almost next to the " teeri " base .
why were we chosen?
i've been there before .
what's that?
an old boot leg .
i'll carry the camera with it .
at " boil " we have our hands full .
the boil " , july 4th , 1942
we'll split into small groups and attack all the posts simultaneously .
our artillery will provide cover fire for one minute .
follow me .
we'll need a lot of grenades and charges .
forss , hndig , bergroth .
take a photo of me leaving .
now !
is everybody here?
no wounded?
something's wrong .
where are those damn russkies?
it's too quiet !
russkies !
we'll bring the wounded .
good .
we destroyed nine of the ten posts .
good .
the last one remained .
the russkies struck back .
they have about thirty casualties .
two of us were slightly wounded .
well done !
you'll get an extra leave .
give me a list tomorrow .
you call this a pot?
you won't win the war with toys .
it would've been worse if forss hadn't seen the russkies .
i had no idea what happened further back .
our artillery didn't know the russkies were so close .
you started the attack before the last grenades fell .
the last grenades came too late .
i don't know what went wrong .
watches were synchronised .
we were very lucky .
but do we need artillery support?
what do you mean?
we could sneak into their positions instead of attacking .
then the battle would be fought on our terms .
sounds unusual and nerve racking but it's worth a try .
the risk of exposure diminishes if the group is smaller .
not a bad idea , allan .
hedengren talked about furlough .
that'd be nice .
that swede is ok .
it's bold to come here voluntarily from safe sweden .
there should be more than hndig and hedengren .
our neighbour , ir 13 , has an entire company , 140 men .
volunteers , yes .
but the official view of sweden ...
there've been signs .
a friend of mine from helsinki is in the 11th division .
he told me what he saw last year at smjrvi .
that officer has a soviet uniform .
is he a pow?
what?
he's a lieutenant colonel in the swedish army .
oh , really?
it's about time sweden joined us .
your royal highness .
this road goes to lake onega and petroskoi .
the main road here goes to aunus and lake ladoga .
a 100 kilometres away .
your royal highness " , he said .
a real royal !
i recognised him from a magazine .
it's prince gustaf adolf .
you have a fancy passenger .
a prince .
he dares to come this close to the line .
what's he doing here?
you can ask someone else .
but he's well informed .
i heard him talking to colonel .
he had a hard time answering all the questions .
and that prince is no sissy .
he wanted to volunteer for the winter war but his grandfather , the king , wouldn't let him .
that's understandable .
but he did let the prince come here .
you remember that?
in march .
it was reported in the newspapers .
headquarters , mikkeli .
march 1942 of the brave finns and you , field marshal .
to show our appreciation my grandfather
his majesty king gustaf , stows upon you a knighthood and a first class grand cross .
the finnish people have never wanted war .
but neither did we hesitate to take arms to defend our country .
the swedish royal family knows that we weren't born yesterday .
mannerheim said that this is finland's war .
i wanted to go to leningrad but he refused to attack , twice !
hitler was furious .
we happen to have the same enemy .
the winter war was worse .
we fought the russkies and germans .
when mannerheim turned 75 hitler paid him a visit .
think about it .
mannerheim , who is a lot taller than hitler marching fast .
quiet .
the news .
headquarters announced that one of our attack patrols invaded the enemy positions and destroyed almost ten enemy posts .
thirty enemy soldiers were killed ...
that's you .
jrv's patrol made the news .
tomorrow i'll go to officer training .
us young officers are too lenient with you rascals .
it'll change when i come back .
ok , sir !
shut your pie hole !
is it any good?
you finally came back .
did you do well in the training?
you have a little tan .
nothing's changed here .
what was the training like?
what i expected .
what the hell ...?
hi , harry !
what was the training like?
was it bad?
whose are these?
that's mine .
there are other guns in similar condition .
commanders pressure subordinates and me too and you just lie here !
i'm gone for two weeks and everything is a mess !
they tried to force us to become more disciplined .
like in peacetime .
but we didn't give a damn .
no one has to be toady to me .
but the russkies may come any time so the guns have to be ready !
inspection in ten minutes .
slobs get extra guard duty .
frilund too !
this happens if you're not diligent .
we proceeded undetected into enemy territory and acted fast .
we dominated the battle the whole time .
this is routine .
but now we have a prisoner .
i heard that you asked when they want the prisoner .
saturday at the latest !
we fulfilled our mission and took a prisoner .
there were no casualties .
the same with the jaegers .
thanks , harry .
well done .
you've done almost thirty missions .
this one went well too .
they've mostly been recon missions .
but there were too many of us .
nine or ten would be enough .
we could discreetly attack the enemy bases .
i heard that !
you have a point .
how did you prepare for the attack?
for three nights we observed them , learnt their routines .
lieutenant colonel , who ...?
my name's marttinen .
i wanted this prisoner .
i'm the division chief of staff .
soon i'll be your regiment commander .
i'll try to speak swedish , at least with the rank and file .
we'll be seeing each other a lot .
von wilcken !
ask the prisoner for his name and unit .
his name is kungurchev .
his unit is ir 1061 .
infantry regiments 61 and 1061?
you see !
they outnumber us by a thousand .
we'll do fine .
good guys .
i think we'll get along .
interpreter , take the prisoner .
hq of the regiment staff , 1942
why is it written in swedish?
you do know finnish , captain taxell .
ir 61 is swedish speaking .
everything is written in swedish .
you're right , captain .
you studied at bo akademi university?
could you get me a textbook?
my swedish is a little rusty .
gladly , sir .
everything ok?
it's peaceful .
my shift ends in thirty minutes ...
help me !
here i am again .
good .
you came back .
you got a package .
i found something in vaasa .
did you have fun?
hi , guys !
greetings from vaasa .
you came back .
how's it going?
well ...
franzn got killed .
a sniper shot him in the mouth when he was on guard duty .
franzn too ...
jrv brought a new pot .
we have to take care of that sniper .
i talked with our headmaster in vaasa .
he said we should use our " free time " for educating ourselves .
he thought of us?
ragnar krook is a fine man .
he suggested correspondence courses .
you can do your homework here .
he'll test you later .
i have some exercises with me .
i'll be your instructor .
we don't have enough lamp oil for reading at night .
wait .
the russkies left a lot of phone cable behind .
we've done some experiments .
look at this .
look at that .
not bad .
just don't burn the dug out .
it's been peaceful .
i'll get some sleep .
get up , guys !
our country is calling for your services !
the coffee substitute is ready !
shut your pie hole , forss .
gimme your mess kit , you'll wake up .
what the hell did you make?
cat pee?
don't swear so much .
it's nasty .
everything's getting worse .
don't drink that shit .
it's better to have tea .
is it quiet?
yes .
good .
stop !
password !
spruce ...
twigs .
correct .
i'm reverend hgstrm .
i wanted to meet you soldiers at " the dam " .
welcome .
thank you .
good evening .
how's it going in here?
nothing new .
please , sit .
kaustinen !
make some substitute for the reverend .
a lot of grounds here .
what the hell?
a foot cloth !
no wonder it's tasted like shit all week .
here you are , reverend .
thank you .
i've visited many bases but none like this .
you've worked hard with the trenches , dug outs and forts .
this looks really great .
the russkies won't get through easily .
but soldiers also need free time .
nobody can take this for too long .
they need some counterbalance .
some of the guys and i read and study .
sderman is studying for his a levels .
i'd go crazy without books .
you're studying in these circumstances?
yes , reverend .
jrv arranged it with our headmaster .
some don't care for culture .
they sleep whenever they can .
young man , you have a fine camaraderie here .
good luck to you all .
i hope the lord protects you .
thank you for the refreshments .
thank you for coming .
what does this word , " danger " , mean?
it means jeopardy .
if it's really dangerous you can say " peril " .
the british have a lot of words .
look them up and you'll learn .
odd .
looking them up?
no , studying english whilst they've declared war on us .
what a joke .
soon only brazil will not be at war against us .
but the gentlemanly british ...
it's understandable .
they fight against the germans and we threaten their supply lines .
bertel , i'll read you an excerpt of english at its best .
that's " peril " for you .
what did it mean?
something like this .
only noble finland , even in the jaws of peril "
shows what free men can do .
sounds wonderful .
who said that?
guess .
our " enemy " churchill .
during the winter war .
we both know that we still fight against the same enemy .
some old veterans are allowed to go to home .
but even you new guys should take guard duty seriously .
the russkies are close so be watchful .
how close , sir?
you don't have to call me that here .
their defensive perimeter runs behind that hill .
it was relatively quiet but now they're hitting us with 60 grenades a day , at noon .
what do we do then?
take cover in the dug out .
the guards remain at their posts .
snipers are the worst .
don't show yourself needlessly .
many men have died here .
their snipers are good at what they do .
someone's coming .
the platoon's second in command forss .
he'll take a last look , he's going to officers 'school .
it's time .
i guess there's not much to say .
thanks for everything .
thanks , lasse .
i'm happy for you but i know what i'm losing .
kaustinen is a good replacement .
we both know it .
i hope you can take care of that sniper .
he's killed far too many .
trust me .
we'll deal with that bastard .
hang tight .
hang tight , boys !
lasse !
you should stop smoking .
it's bad for your health .
you just watch for the flying lead .
nicotine is my problem !
bye bye !
that was today's lesson .
don't you have any more hand grenades?
i'll get you more .
that was the sniper .
oh , yeah?
he wasn't good enough .
i'll go to see marttinen .
i won't be long .
come in .
i'm sorry , you looked like dbeln first .
it's nothing .
the bullet just scratched me .
sit down .
i'll get straight to the point .
we haven't been able to destroy the russian base " bird " .
another regiment tried to destroy it in march 1942 in vain .
two companies , engineers and jaegers attacked in snow and open terrain .
it was insane !
they didn't get anywhere .
19 were killed and dozens wounded .
i heard about it .
it'll be different now .
second lieutenant jrv you'll get the first chance .
i believe in you .
do you have enough volunteers?
more than enough .
ten men is enough .
the rest can be support troops .
good .
let me know when your group is ready .
i'll issue specific orders about strike groups and cover fire .
you know that " bird " is strong .
they have at least two platoons , three machine guns and mortars .
ok , boys .
i promised marttinen you'd come along .
we'll leave at 1830 hours .
heln leads one group , nordman the other .
we can trust them .
even the battalion commander got involved .
guess what i was ordered?
only i can have a submachine gun , the rest get rifles .
we can't afford to lose ten submachine guns . " asshole !
a submachine gun and three hand grenades for everyone .
frnde , make sure we have piled up charges .
i know where to put one .
up the major's ass !
you won't see him there .
but lieutenant colonel marttinen seems to like it there .
form a row , i'll take a picture .
where's backholm?
sleeping .
let him sleep .
it's going to be a rough night .
bjrk , move closer so everybody fits in the photo .
good .
there's a guard ahead .
let's go right .
the bird " , february 8th and 9th , 1943
there's a guard too .
let's try the middle .
it's past midnight .
we've been here for five hours .
it can't be helped .
my leg has frostbite .
i'll rub it .
no , go back .
let the medic take care of it .
there's a machine gun here .
you'll secure the rear .
finholm , fagerstrm , frnde , come with me .
there it is !
it's unmanned that's the way they are .
let's blow it up .
that was a stove hatch .
now we know where they are .
the russkies are on the left .
stay here to cover us .
that's the main dug out .
lieutenant , fire artillery barrage .
understood , sir !
goddamn assholes !
grenades !
don't be afraid !
greetings from the white bandits !
hurry !
reinforcements may be on the way .
grenades here !
die , finnish scum !
greetings to mannerheim !
i'll show you , bandits !
you're gonna get it !
more russkies !
they won't surrender .
use a charge !
help ...
my leg ...
we're about ready , is everyone here?
you ok?
a few pieces of shrapnels in my leg .
nothing serious .
good .
let's go or the whole red army will be on our tail .
tough russkies , nobody surrendered .
take him with you .
stretcher !
he was hit in the lungs .
you got lucky , ragnar .
we'll see you soon .
hey , jrv .
aren't you ever afraid?
i'm sometimes really afraid .
of course i'm afraid .
no normal 20 year old wants to die .
in battle i feel a knot in my stomach .
it's not paralysing fear but adrenaline surging into my brain .
it makes me 100 % effective .
but some react differently .
they freeze or run away scared .
fear must be controlled .
you know how .
otherwise i wouldn't take you with me .
of course i'm sometimes afraid .
but not as much when jrv is with us .
here they come !
his name is nikolai smirnov .
take him to the first aid station quickly .
he is valuable .
if he stays alive .
we'll go to the dug out .
wait .
we carried him and now he's dead .
it wasn't exactly his fault .
let's take him inside .
they can bury him .
klas ...
i've been thinking .
strange .
smirnov shot me in the lungs four months ago .
now he's dead .
and you're very much alive !
do you hear?
the russkies 'time signal is as punctual as ...
ragnar !
is anyone else wounded?
how did they hit such a small hole?
stretchers .
i'll immortalise one corner of our great dwelling .
stay there so the photo looks more life like .
sit at the end of the table , kaustinen .
try to look like you're learning something .
sderman , sit and look into the camera .
you can show your girl what good conditions you have here .
i'm not in the mood today .
don't move .
why are you sulking on such a beautiful day?
the girl i told you about the other day ...
i got a letter from her .
she's not my girl .
did she break it off?
it didn't even start .
sounds bad .
let's leave him alone .
i'm sorry .
captain .
the army corps ordered us to increase our patrols .
tell lieutenants jrv and mattas to come here .
yes , sir .
we're on time .
i wonder what's so important .
who knows?
soon we'll find out .
lieutenant colonel .
at ease !
sit down .
gentlemen , we received new general orders .
every company must send one recon or strike patrol to the front line every day .
jrv , you'll be the regiment's patrol leader .
mattas is your deputy .
the jaeger company has other duties .
questions?
i've only used volunteers in my patrols .
are we supposed to patrol for others as well?
i'm not asking that .
you can assign men from other units if you want .
it's your business if you want to do others 'work .
that's all .
good luck and thank you .
you may return to your units .
one moment .
thank you .
we have a lot of work ahead of us .
true .
marttinen is breathing down our necks .
you know why?
he wants us to be battle ready .
forts and patrols are for that .
indeed .
he won't let us become lazy .
we must be vigilant and earn the enemy's respect .
it's good for morale .
but it means casualties .
exactly .
he doesn't think the price is too high .
the dam " , jrv .
taxell here .
marttinen wants you to recon a russian base next to 2nd battalion .
and a prisoner .
will you do it?
the boys at 2nd scouted the place .
ok .
it must be planned well .
i want details of their defences .
i'll speak to my colleagues .
i'll get back to you .
over .
can i come along?
sure .
we work well together .
i'll come along .
ok .
yes?
can i come along?
can i come along?
welcome .
this'll be a good strike group .
seven men is enough .
we'll go to 2nd battalion to get to know the situation .
just a few hours left ...
don't worry , bertel .
it'll go well , you'll see .
damn bedbugs !
what are you reading?
show me .
history of philosophy .
you've read it thoroughly .
it's a good book .
socrates .
plato .
i want to read this .
of course .
plato is overrated .
a metaphysicist and a speculative philosopher .
quit lecturing and turn off the light .
we want to sleep .
soon .
in plato's model society individuals had no rights .
the role of literature was to idolise the powers that be .
plato's society has now come to pass with stalin and hitler .
really?
we weren't taught that .
aristotle is much better .
his thinking is based on reality .
but he did make mistakes .
he said that nordic people are brave in war but dumb in the head .
that's his opinion of us .
now we should sleep .
lf it's possible .
the battle begins here .
jrv and his men go in , major tirronen fires the artillery .
thank you , lieutenant mangs .
you know your mission .
i want a prisoner .
your other task is to crush the base " sea " .
i'm counting on you to do your best .
i'll be around until the mission is over .
let's take a picture .
did you notice that sderman has grown ten centimetres?
laugh all you want .
napoleon was small and a corporal too .
we can't go forward .
let's try another way .
this is a good spot .
take a break .
it's too quiet .
it's three o'clock already .
we have to wait for the evening breeze .
heln , finholm .
finally you're here !
i came at once .
what now?
someone was standing there !
there !
no one's there .
calm down .
there is !
i saw a face !
you saw a ghost .
he's nervous .
damn , they don't believe me !
what's the time?
three on the dot .
mission began 18 hours ago .
i guess i dare to smoke one .
or do i?
not moving for four hours and thinking of smoking was hard .
damn !
i have to quit this .
my word of honour .
when we beat " the sea " i'll smoke no more !
i promise .
get up , boys .
time to get busy .
harry !
sderman !
no ...
jrv , i'm hit !
leave if you can !
boys !
kaustinen and i are wounded !
can you make it?
yes , i can .
allan , grenade !
can you make it?
you understand?
walk to the first aid station .
stman !
that way .
no prisoner this day either .
yeah .
we have casualties : one dead and seven wounded .
the sea " was destroyed but we have no prisoner .
the russkies fought hard .
about thirty of them were killed .
i thank you all and the strike group .
the wounded will receive good treatment .
lieutenant , come to report at my hq at noon .
yes , sir .
no one has died for me before .
and sderman of all people ...
he sacrificed himself for me .
the law of war is hard .
but it's not your fault .
mangs , take a picture of heln and me .
sure .
press there .
that's sderman's box .
the small one .
listen to what sderman wrote .
if i get killed , i want to die like a finnish soldier .
and he did .
fire !
our last respects to our brave comrade in arms "
corporal bertel sderman .
rest in peace .
your friends at the front .
dear friends and family of bertel sderman .
my talented young student had his whole life ahead of him .
but destiny decided otherwise .
even in grim circumstances bertel remained humane .
and he was also a brave soldier .
there is no greater sacrifice than giving his life for his comrades .
now we'll carry his memory with us which is as bright as the marble in the ballroom of the school .
his name will be engraved in it where it will shine for the following generations .
i've lost so many great boys .
what are your plans?
no matter how the war ends .
i don't know .
i've enquired about degree requirements from the university .
you've always been interested in everything .
good luck , my friend .
thank you , headmaster .
you know your mission .
take a prisoner and recon in the russkie hinterland .
good luck .
strike groups !
mines !
we'll stop here .
lindblad , go further back with olof and kanckos .
we'll try capturing a lone russkie .
it must be done in silence .
no gun fire !
capturing many is too risky .
we're too far behind the lines .
let them go .
we would have to fire .
look at those clothes .
next time someone says that russkies have bad uniforms , i'll beat them !
no more russkies , i guess .
let's go home and continue tomorrow .
harry !
don't move !
it's clear now .
ufa !
you must leave me here .
go on !
there's no point in you staying here !
jrv hit a mine .
dammit , boys !
we can't leave him even if he ordered us .
i'm going back .
as i was laying there i thought about books
i hadn't read yet .
i thought of all the pretty girls i'd never get to see ...
and i felt that it was unreasonable to die at the age of 22 .
i ordered you to go .
you told us about the three musketeers .
one for all and all for one .
how are you?
can you walk?
good !
we'll take jrv .
and nordstrm .
switch !
how are you , lindblad?
just a flesh wound .
i can help you .
klockars !
check if they need help .
yes , sir !
give him water .
let's go .
does anyone know their blood type?
mine's o.
good .
you'll donate blood .
how are you , lindblad?
nothing serious?
no , sir .
i'll be ok soon .
good .
i need men like you .
that was fast , boys .
thank you .
sit down .
giving blood is no easy task .
i feel dizzy .
how is jrv?
he came to after three bottles of plasma .
and a hefty dose of my blood .
you can be proud , corporal .
thank you , lieutenant .
thank you for everything .
you'll make it .
i spent a long time at the hospital .
the wound didn't heal and had to be operated on many times .
st gran's hospital , may 1944
you got mail .
from my regiment commander .
nice .
he still remembers me .
it's been nine months already .
how are you feeling?
ok .
a soldier's hand , foot and life can be taken .
may lord protect this land , that is all i want .
thus sang a soldier begging for money in ensign stl .
he didn't feel sorry for his lost leg .
our country is what mattered the most .
you have that same courage .
you've shown it in spades .
your work is done , your duty fulfilled .
i am proud of you .
remember to write to us .
if you need something , we'll do our best to help you .
your comrade , lieutenant colonel alpo marttinen .
soon you'll walk with a prosthetic limb .
we'll transfer you to salsta castle .
baroness wera von essen has set up a convalescence home for finnish soldiers .
reconnaissance division june 7th , 1944 , stockholm
i'd like to speak to engineer lieutenant nils erik stenbck .
stenbck .
hi , nils erik .
it's curt wennberg .
hq's reconnaissance division , mikkeli
how are you?
i'll speak candidly .
what the devil are you doing?
the russkies have 24 divisions ready for attack .
twenty four?
cannons and tanks side by side .
and more motorised units are coming .
the attack may start at anytime and you're not even practising !
unbelievable .
i just wanted to warn you .
not exactly good news , curt .
but thanks .
a lot .
ketonen , dammit !
even the swedes know the russians are launching a major offensive .
looks like it .
they've concentrated more troops than we anticipated .
i wrote in the report that a major offensive may start any day .
we'll see if the big boys like it .
you can't do that .
you know general airo's orders .
mannerheim is not to be unnerved .
it doesn't change the facts .
sounds horrible .
it's the real deal in karelia now .
believe me , boys .
we won't get old here .
61 is heading west soon .
you almost hope for it .
what the hell are we doing here if helsinki is under threat?
vyborg fell suddenly on june 20th which caused a threat .
if russkies had crossed the strait they would've gotten to helsinki .
instead they stopped at vyborg to celebrate their victory .
ir 61 was ordered to assume command of tienhaara .
marttinen understood what was at stake .
he told his men over and over again that tienhaara was finland's lock .
and he was determined to keep it locked .
we're getting close .
we'll arrive in about thirty minutes .
the company will march to tienhaara .
expect artillery and aerial attacks .
the boys shouldn't march in too tight a formation .
look at this map .
salsta castle .
june 10th , 1944
you're very kind , baroness .
you've deserved your coffee .
go ahead .
cream and sugar?
no , thanks .
here is the news .
the soviet union has launched a major offensive in karelia .
the finnish posts were heavily bombarded yesterday .
and the bombardment intensified this morning .
soviet forces have broken through finnish defences and forced the finns to withdraw .
in normandy , the allied forces have strengthened ...
it's time for me to go back .
are you going to the front with that leg?
it hasn't even healed properly .
perhaps .
and it's driving me crazy !
my place is at the front .
excuse me ...
don't think i'm not grateful to you and sweden .
of course not .
karelian peninsula , june 22nd , 1944

major eino penttil , lieutenant colonel .
alpo marttinen , commander of ir 61 .
i've defended kivisillansalmi with two short handed battalions .
the russkies tried to come across an hour ago .
about a company , but they were beaten .
you came at the last minute .
we've fought for two weeks against their point of offensive .
this group is near the end .

to your right side are the estonian volunteers , ir 200 .
captain renvall's 2nd battalion will be reserves at the rear .
position the machine guns at the waterside .
the artillery fire will be murderous .
every man has to dig himself a foxhole .
sweat spares blood .
tell that to your men .
i know that they're tired and hungry after the march but the situation is as it is .
questions?
the first companies arrive shortly .
go !
wessberg .
tell the artillery commander to come here .
co operation with the artillery communications and maintenance must be improved .
understood , sir .
what the hell?
they're going the wrong way .
shut up , boys !
don't mind us .
who knows what hell they've been through .
let's get to it .
like marttinen said , sweat spares blood .
you must be able to shoot to those bridges .
lieutenant colonel .
major heikki huttunen , commander of 1st artillery battalion of far 8 .
rauramo assigned me to be your artillery commander .
marttinen .
lieutenant sipilinen .

sounds good .

the times are hard but marttinen has it under control .
we'll be ok .
what is it , harry?
can't you get any sleep?
no .
are you thinking of our comrades?
it's horrible to lie here , i should be there with them .
we'll come to get you .
are there any more wounded?
are you nuts?
get down !
oh , hell !
who's going to take care of them now?
unis .
nystrm is out of the game .
you'll take command of the platoon .
i'll take command of the company after captain joffs .
major holmberg says that all 1st company commanders are wounded .
pikulinsky , holmstrm and hjort .
the 11th company was under concentrated artillery fire .
joffs and nystrm are both out .
lfman assumed command and unis took over nystrm's platoon .
they've lost 27 men , only six are left .
wessberg !
contact the estonian volunteers .
if the situation cools , we leave .
we're not staying here to die .
here they come !
defense sorvali !
fire !
defense linna !
fire !
dammit !
all the lines are broken !
one to two battalions?
i can't make it out .
one to two battalions are attacking over the sorvali and linnasaari strait .
right?
contact the division hq !
give it to me .
the cannons are aimed?
yes .
captain renvall , il/ ir 61 , connect to the artillery office !
captain hnninen .
captain renvall .
russkies attack from linnasaari and sorvali with two battalions .
two battalions !
i'll take full responsibility and order you to fire !
they've had enough for now .
but they'll be back !
headquarters , mikkeli
can tienhaara hold if it sounds like this 120 kilometres away?
the 3rd battalion commander says that the russkies have broken through at kivisilta .
thank you .
you can go back .
wessberg !
the russkies must be beaten !
here's an order for major holmberg .
how many assault guns will support us?
two , sir .
you two go to major holmberg with this order .
but on separate routes .
understood?
yes , sir .
medics !
sir , an order from the commander .
thank you .
listen , boys !
one or two platoons have broken through at kivisilta .
they must be stopped .
use assault guns in counterattack .
an energetic officer must lead it to make it work .
it must be done swiftly .
reserves must be used without compunction .
marttinen .
lfman , you'll strike back with the 11th company .
our artillery and two assault guns will lay down cover fire .
it's ok .
good luck .
thank you , sir .
11th company , follow me !
platoon commanders and group leaders here !
to the bridge !
at any cost !
we could use jrv now .
no kidding .
they're here !
medic !
they're not here anymore .
my weapon ...
and lfman?
he's dead .
a call from headquarters to the commander of ir 61 .
this is the commander in chief .
lieutenant colonel marttinen , sir field marshal !
do you have the situation under control , lieutenant colonel?
tienhaara will hold , sir .
tienhaara will hold ...
i thank you ...
colonel .
relay my thanks to the regiment .
our country is saved ... for now .
thank you , sir field marshal .
over .
hello .
congratulations , colonel .
the russkies have had enough for now .
but the price was too high .
i lost hundreds of men .
five company commanders died today .
there are only 38 men left in the 11th company .
war is hard .
colonel , i heard you were promoted .
congratulations .
thank you , lieutenant .
but in all honesty i have to say that this battle was won mainly because of the artillery .
tell that to your regiment .
shouldn't you rest , colonel?
it's quieter now .
no .
i must go to the front line to thank the men .
marshal's orders .
soldiers !
it's been a tough day .
we will never see many of our comrades again .
and even more were wounded .
but i'm very proud of you .
our commander in chief field marshal mannerheim personally asked me to thank you , men of ir 61 .
because of you he promoted me to colonel .
no russkies who came here remained alive .
you also , lieutenant lillandt , have been promoted .
congratulations , captain .
remember what i said , boys !
tienhaara is finland's lock .
i rely on you .
the marshal relies on us !
do you think that the troops will hold?
yes , colonel .
the foxholes are the best place to be .
we'll be ok if the artillery is as good as today .
if there's enough munitions and bread and other food too .
thanks , captain .
i'll make sure you'll get all you need .
we cannot retreat unless there's peace .
if we want to save our lives and our nation .
what did he want?
nothing special .
he gave a speech to the boys .
during the days and weeks in tienhaara
ir 61 lost 820 men .
but the finnish lock and the road to helsinki remained closed .
a few weeks after that
finland's independence was at stake every day .
after tienhaara , the red army tried to win the war at tali lhantala .
the largest battle of the nordic countries was fought there .
