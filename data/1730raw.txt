mrs. wilson?
mrs. wilson .
mrs. wilson , your husband , ben wilson senior , was one ofthe men killed last year in the explosion ... out at the reinhold cable plant .
yes , that's right .
andyou were ieft with threesmaii children to raise onyourown .
yes , sir .
how do you provide foryou and your sons?
i get a little bit of money from social security ... as a result of my husband's death .
and , uh ,
i also give readings .
psychic readings .
yes , sir .
what doesbeingpsychic enableyou to do?
i see things ... and i , you know i sense ... things ... that well , they hadn't happened yet ... orthey were happening someplace else .
my granny told me that i i had a gift that runs in my family .
and she told me that i shouldn't be afraid of it .
i should just always use my instinct and i'd i'd be all right .
so , you'reswearing before this court ... that you didn't get your information about this tragedy ... from any other means than your special ability?
your gift .
yes , sir .
i'm swearing that .
yes .
thankyou , mrs. wilson .
yes , sir .
i have no further questions .
mr. weems .
mrs. wilson .
how many fiingers am i holding up behind my back?
objection , your honor .
yourhonor , my client is sitting in this courtroom on trial for his life ... partlybecause ofpowers that this woman claims to have .
now , in all fairness , i believe i should be given the opportunity ... to test the alleged powers ... instead of having to stand here and take her word for it .
you have a good point .
objection overruled .
can everyone in thejury box see how many fiingers i'm showing?
how many fiingers , mrs. wilson?
i don't know .
you don't know?
seven .
seven fingers .
that that doesn't prove anything .
your honor , i can't do this , you know , at the drop ofa hat .
well , then , ma'am , how about doing it at the drop ofa dollar bill?
what are you trying to say?
i'm trying to say maybe this special gift ofyours doesn't work ... unless you're being paid for it .
like they say in the army , " no money , no honey .
no , that's not true .
are you aware that in hatcher county it's against the law ... for a psychic to set up shop and charge people money?
well , i don't charge money .
you just testifiied that you do charge money .
no .
i accept donations .
people give me gifts .
oh .
a distinction worthy ofa lawyer .
mrs. wilson , you a rich woman?
no .
why not?
if i had psychic powers and could read the future , i'd be fiilthy rich .
i'dbeplaying thestockmarket .
i'dbe overin mobile betting on the dogs .
i'd certainly warn my husband not to go to work ... on the day i know the reinhold plant's gonna blow up ...
leaving three little ol 'children to be raised in a carnival sideshow .
well , it doesn't work that way , sir .
i can't use my gift for personal gain .
except for those , uh , what you call 'em , donations?
you've had some personal trouble with donnie barksdale , haven't you?
yes , i have .
just a few weeks ago , you told him i believe the exact words was ... you was gonna have his ass thrown in jail .
but he was threatening my kids .
ain't it also true ... that a few weeks ago in one of those famous readings ofyours , when you were doing your so called e. s. p. , you told valerie barksdale , donnie's wife , that donnie wasjust an insecure redneck ... and that he wasn't really crazy enough to kill anybody?
yes , i did say that .
then why today are you saying he did kill somebody?
wait a second .
i've never said that .
you might as well have , ma'am .
you wanted his ass in jail .
he's on trial for his life .
i just told the sheriffwhat i saw .
and how could any of us ever forget that?
jessica kingjust floatin 'up in that tree , naked , with a chain ... wrappedaroundher .
it must be so much fun foryou .
you must be having the time ofyour life ... entertaining yourself with your dreams and your visions .
you think it's fun seeing decomposed bodies in my tree , do you , sir?
you think that's fun?
do you think it's fun i have people trying to strangle me in my sleep?
nowl'm sittinghere andl'm blaming myself ...
'cause some poor crazy man tried to burn his daddy halfto death .
and you think i'm sitting here having fun?
i'm sorry , sir .
you're crazy ifyou think that .
no more questions , your honor .
you're dismissed .
like theysay in hoilywood , iet'sjust cut to the chase .
did you or did you not kill jessica king?
i did not .
did you or did you not seejessica king on the night she was killed?
yeah , i seen her .
would you describe the circumstances , please?
well , i'd been seeing her for quite a while .
wouldyou clarify what you mean by " seeing "?
i mean , her and me had been having sex .
okay , go ahead .
weil , she cailedme about 1 1 . : 00 .
so i told her i'd meet her out at ayjay's .
and i told my wife i was going out for a beer .
what happened after that?
well , we got in an argument .
she told me she didn't want to see me no more .
did she tell you why?
she said she was getting married ... in a couple of months and she wanted to stop playing around .
at ieast tiilafterthe wedding .
andduring the course ofthisargument with miss king , did you at any moment strike her?
yes , sir .
what happened afteryou struck her?
weil , she bangedherhead prettyhard when she went down , so i idecided to take herto the hospital .
did you reach the hospital?
no , sir .
are you feeling okay?
i'm fiine .
i wanna go back .
i don't wanna go to the hospital .
someone
someone might see me .
shesaidshe wasfeelingbetter , so itookherback toayjay's .
idroppedheroff , then i went on backhome .
andthat was the verylast time thatyousawjessica kingalive?
yes , sir .
the very last .
donnie , are you guilty ofthe charge against you?
i'm guilty ofcheating on my wife , ofbeinga badhusband , a badchristian .
but i ain't guilty of killingjesse .
i swear to god .
no more questions , your honor .
mr. duncan .
mr. barksdale , you're a wife beater , aren't you?
i've swore to tell the truth here today .
yeah , i've hit valerie before .
i guess it ain't no secret .
so , you admit to havinga history ofviolence against women?
you also admit to having beaten up the victim ... on the night that she was murdered .
i wouldn't exactly say that i beat her up .
you're the expert .
you teilme .
just howbadly doyou ... have to beat a woman before it fiits your defiinition of " beating up "?
now , yourstoryis thatyou've been havingan affair ... with the victim .
but tell us why a beautiful young woman likejessica king ... from one ofthe fiinest families in brixton , just about to be married to a good , decent professional man ... and with a bright , shining future in front ofher
why would a woman like that get involved with something like you?
i asked her that myselfone time .
she said i was the only man in town who knew how to fuck .
you're really disgusting .
you know that?
objection , your honor .
objection sustained .
mr. duncan , you will refrain from making those personal comments .
i apologize , your honor .
it won't happen again .
so , let's get this straight .
let's clarify this .
you're saying it was just a coincidence ... that on the very same night that you physically assaulted jessica king , someone else put her body in your pond?
i'm not saying it was a coincidence .
what are you saying?
i'm saying i got framed !
oh , well , what an original defense .
did you think ofjessica king as a stray cat?
no .
did you tell sheriffjohnson that a stray cat had clawed your arm?
yeah .
didn't you just tell the court ...
jessica had scratched your arm?
yeah , but
didn't you tell sheriffjohnson you got scratched by the stray cat ... because she didn't like it when you killed her?
yeah , but i was lying .
my wife was standing right there !
how do i know you're not lying now?
because i'm not , goddamn it !
it's her , goddamn it !
be seated , mr. barksdale !
she's the reason i'm up here !
she'sagoddamn witch !
she'sputting speils on every goddamn body in town !
witch !
witch !
yeah , you run !
i'llhave orderin the courtroom .
in brixton today , a sensationai murdertriai was concluded .
donaldj .
barksdale wasfoundguilty ... in thesexandstrangulation kiiling ofjessica king , daughteroftheprominent brixton businessman , kenneth king .
is everything gonna be all right now , mama?
yeah , hon .
we can get on with our lives now .
i guess i'm the last person you wanna see .
how you been?
terrible .
annie , ifyou tell me to get going , i will .
i wouldn't blame you .
but i need you to read for me .
give me a hand .
i feel like i can't hold on any longer .
i know donnie's mean and everything , but i feel real lost without him .
you know , i ain't never been on my own before .
and i'm i'm scared , annie .
you don't need to be scared , hon .
you'll be fiine .
you see that in the cards?
mm hmm .
right through here .
but can you see what what i'm thinking?
can you see that in the cards?
what do you mean?
well ,
i've been thinking some real bad , bad thoughts .
unchristian thoughts .
like what?
like
i'm glad that girl's dead .
jessica .
she was messin 'around with my husband and deserved what she got .
no one deserves that .
like i said , i know it's unchristian .
what?
what , areyou seeingsomethingbad?
i don't know .
it's not clear .
fuckyou !
wayne?
wayne?
it's not normally like this .
you need to lie down .
i'm really not sleepy .
i think ifyou sleep , you'll feel better .
thankyou , annie .
oh .
it's okay .
wayne .
i don't think this is a good idea .
no .
it's not .
i just thought we could forget all this for a while .
you want to , don'tyou?
i know there's something between us .
i can't .
i guess i still feel married .
you're not , though .
he's gone .
i know .
you gotta learn to deal with that .
the same way i gotta learn to deal with the fact thatjessica's gone .
she's dead .
oh , wayne , i'm so sorry .
it's okay .
no , it's not okay .
i i don't think donnie barksdale killed her .
no , no , annie .
i'm really sorry .
i can't i can't do this .
it's fiinished .
i know .
i wanna let that bastard rot in jail .
but he's guilty .
no , wayne .
i see it .
i see he didn't do it .
do you see who did?
uh , i'm trying , but i i
i don't know yet .
what are we gonna do?
well , if i had a piece ofclothing ... or maybe i could go out to the pond or see if i
it's not over .
jesus .
come on in .
well , what brings you out here?
well , i'll just come straight out and say it .
i don't think donnie barksdale killed jessica king .
well , sure he did .
it was an open and shut case .
i'm telling you he didn't .
the person that killed jessica is still out there someplace .
what's the deal?
the barksdales been threatening you?
no .
i'll talk to pearl johnson .
this has nothing to do with the barksdales .
listen .
i know that donnie didn't kill jessica ... the same way that i knew that her body was in his pond .
and do you know who did kill her?
no .
so , what do you care?
the son ofa bitch is in jail .
i got a warning today .
i think somebody is gonna try and kill me .
what do you want me to do?
reopen the case and fiind out who really did it .
i can't .
he's been convicted .
well , you can talk to somebody .
i've got no basis to open this case .
i'd look like a fool .
i don't give a damn how you look .
now , you listen to me .
i know you had an affair withjessica .
so how do you thinkyou're gonna look if people fiind out ... you had sex with the victim the night before she was killed?
do you want money?
no .
i want you to reopen the case .
there's a saying about letting sleeping dogs lie .
you thinkyou're in danger now?
look at it logically .
the real danger begins ifthis case gets reopened and someone starts ... worrying that you're gonna have another one ofyour damn dreams .
all i know is , the wrong man's in jail .
i don't care how awful he is .
and i helped put him there .
i can't live with something like that .
so you fiind a way to reopen this case , sir .
or i will .
buddy !

i don't know what i'm gonna do .
ever since you told me what you told me , i feel like i'm going crazy .
annie , i can't stand another night ofthis .
i need you to read for me .
it's no good .
try it again .
i can't make it happen .
