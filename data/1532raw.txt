sunrise a song of two humans
this song of the man and his wife is of no place and every place : you might hear it anywhere at any time .
for wherever the sun rises and sets in the city's turmoil or under the open sky on the farm
life is much the same : sometimes bitter , sometimes sweet
summertime ... vacation time
among the vacationists was a woman of the city .
several weeks had passed since her coming and still she lingered .

now he ruins himself for the woman from the city money lenders strip the farm and his wife sits alone .
tell me !
you are all mine?
sell your farm ... come with me to the city .
... and my wife?
couldn't she get
couldn't she get drowned?
... then overturn the boat ... it will look like an accident .
leave this behind ... come to the city !
come to the clty !
... after the boat has capsized , save yourself with these bulrushes .
the rushes will hold you up .
scatter them before you reach the shore and tell everyone she drowned by accident .
we're going for a trip across the water .
i may not be back for quite a while .
don't be afraid of me !
don't be afraid of me !
god is giving you , in the holy blonds of matrimony , a trust .
she is young ... and inexperienced .
guide her and love her ...
... keep and protect her from all harm .

forgive me !

you'd look grand with a high polish !
come again !
thank you !
and you must come and see us some time .
congratulations !
she is the sweetest bride i've seen this year .
farmers !
if you want to sell your home and move to the city we pay cash !
hit the hole ... make the little piggy roll !
we'll sail home by moonlight ... another honeymoon .
... i couldn't give up hope .
i know the tides ...
i went around the point ... " >> napisy pobrane z http : // napisy . org << >>>>>>>> nowa wizja napisw <<<<<<<<
