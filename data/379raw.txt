we're going to the black cove , andre .
best fishing in the basin .
the black cove's in the wildlife refuge , grandpa .
no fishing allowed up there .
our family's fished the black cove since the louisiana purchase , boy .
we ain't gonna stop now , just because some damn pencil pusher ... ... slapped a keep out sign on it .
what in the hell?
oil well?
fire in the hole .
that wasn't here last month .
what are they doing?
scaring away the fish .

shark !
get out of the water !
come on , swim !
no !
through all the parishes , including morgan city and the whole basin .
the temperature's 88 degrees .
tonight , winds from the southeast bringing in isolated thunderstorms ... ... clearing by morning .
tomorrow's sunrise is at 6 : 05 , setting at 8 : 08 .
in between time hot and sticky with a daytime high of 87 .
it'll feel lik e 97 with humidity crawling up to 88 percent .
and now back to louisiana's fav ourite music .
mr. sanders , i've reviewed your file .
over the past three years , you've been late on 14 payments .
yes , ma'am .
it's ... ... a charter fishing boat .
a seasonal business .
on other occasions , i've paid a month in advance .
regrettably , there's no provision in your loan for carrying that credit .
what's that mean?
it means just because you paid ... ... june in advance , we don't waive late charges ... ... if you're delinquent in october .
where's morial?
he's the guy i deal with .
mr. morial has retired .
i've taken over his accounts .
mr. sanders , you have to make your payments on time .
yes , ma'am .
miss one more , we'll call your note .
take my boat?
we will call your note .
how you respond to that is entirely up to you .
you know i can't pay off the entire loan ... ... so i'm gonna have to find a buyer , not easy ... ... or you're gonna repossess , right?
it's standard bank policy .
miss savoy ... ... i make my living with that boat , and i live on it .
i appreciate that .
you don't .
i beg your pardon?
lf you did ... ... you'd look at me as a human being , not just a signature on a bottom line .
make your payments , mr. sanders .
on time .
roger that .
how about that?
what's for dessert?
what's happening , rude boy?
all fruits ripe , rick .
it looks like you're in phat city .
long way from the ten toe turbo?
it looks deceiving , man .
i'm in a cross .
that's why i called you .
i got to have what only bad brett can give me .
okay , lay it down .
yo , homey , what's up with the shark?
that's my cousin , ice .
go ahead , show him .
brett , him a crazy man .
he love to go swim with the sharks .
so one day off cape town , he got bit , so now ...
whenever i get the chance , i bite back .
look , can we ...?
most def , man .
most def .
you remember jerry cullen?
little jerry?
no .
he was my bayou boy , man .
ran ganja for me till babylon scoop him up .
so?
so when he went away ... ... he had something belong to me , and he no give it back .
sounds like a job for ice t over here .

ice don't scuba .

ten percent finder's fee .
what am i finding?
three .
million?
strong money .
it's interesting .

five years ago , jerry was making a run for me out to atchafalaya .
you ever been?
no , it's south louisiana , right?
yeah , man .

basin police show up .
little jerry , he run , and he run , and he run .
when he got caught , guess what's not on the boat .

his woman rent a boat in morgan city yesterday .
i better get on the plane .

i don't think so .
temptation a bitch , brett .
and she already burned me once .
stay out of my way , and we won't have any problems .

bark , bark , dog .
ease up , now .
ease up .
later , rick .
mash it up , brett .
you can count on that .
when you get my money , bust a tack up jerry's ass .
double crossing blood clot .
done .
what about aquaman?
you even dream about it ... ... you'll probably wind up like them guppies .
not even a nibble .
strange .
this river's usually full of catfish .
what was that?
i don't know .
driftwood , probably .
or a gator .
or the biggest catfish in the river !
are you okay?
yeah .
don't you tell nobody about this , see .
i won't .
some catfish , huh , grandpa?
give me your hand , grandpa .
grandpa !
how'd it go , cap?
start looking for another job , emery .
what's wrong with him?
don't know .
you okay , son?
hey , buddy , what happened?
can you hear me?
let's get him up .
come on .
let's get him some water over here .
yeah .
are you okay , boy?
he doesn't seem to have any injuries .
howdy , john .
dale .
what do we got here?
came in on that bateau , seems to be in shock .
earl , get this boy some help .
yes , sir .
come on , boy , let's get you out of the sun .
where you all headed?
lake verret .
oh , boating accident?
now , you see , that's the funny thing .
we got us a report of a shark attack .
now , a shark swims only in the ocean , so that makes it a saltwater fish .
yeah , that's right .
it's mostly right .
mostly?
bull shark .
well , i'll be .
you learn something new every day .
keep it on top of the water , john .
okay , boys , let's shove off .
okay .
cast off that stern line .
i got it .
go .
bull shark , huh?
smart ass .
hello , john .
kelli .
this is gene bradley .
he works with me .
glad to meet you .
kelli's been singing your praises .
really?
can we talk?
it's important .
we shot seismic over black cove in sector 5 .
did avo , and the analysis showed dramatically increasing amplitude ... ... with significant horizontal displacement .
i don't know what the hell you're talking about , girl .
amplitude variation with offset .
it's an interpretation technique ... ... to indicate rock lithology and fluid content .
it means they found a whole bunch of natural gas .
sector 5 is in the wildlife refuge .
whose bright idea was that?
mine .
how'd you swing the lease?
our people tacked it on to ... ... an appropriations bill and slipped it through congress .
energy independence , developing domestic resources , you know .
how many cubic feet?
two to three billion .
we bring this in , discovery petroleum's playing with the big boys .
well , hats and horns .
what are you doing here , kelli?
we've been drilling and coming up with dusters .
we just got a bit stuck and had to break it loose .
so we're a little befuddled .
might have to put that champagne on ice .
john , you're the best dd in the business .
once upon a time .
who's your tool pusher now?
hank ellis .
hank trained me .
he doesn't have your magic .
oh , magic .
right .
could you excuse us , please?
john , i know how you feel about me .
do you?
all right , you want me to say it?
i'll say it .
i need you .
like three years ago?
let's not go through that .
what happened to you , huh , kelli?
and your mighty scientific principles?
i mean , drilling in a wildlife refuge?
i make sure it's done right .
the ecosystem isn't harmed .
pull this one , it plays jingle bells .
money didn't used to mean so much to you .
speaking of which , i know your situation .
i'm doing fine .
you're gonna lose this boat .
that's my business .
you're just hardheaded and stubborn .
you used to like that about me .
look , i am done drilling .
period .
amen .
john , it wasn't your fault .
yes , it was .
i have to live with that every day .
lf you fall off a horse ...
get off my boat .
john .
go on , get the hell off .
maybe we can ...
shut up , gene .
what up , dog?
yo , what's up?
yo , chill , jerry , man .
it's me , ice lce , baby .
yeah , i know .
you need permission to board a man's boat .
no disrespect , man .
rick sent me down here to get his money , homey .
give me a break .
i just popped a nickel for rick .
did i beef on him?
he appreciates that , all right?
all he wants is the bank .
if i had it , i'd give it up , but i don't .
why don't you go tell everybody about your old jerry ...
this knife has gutted fish bigger than you .
lose the biscuit .
read my lips , ice .
i don't got the ...
we know that , you little squirrelly ass bitch .
but you on your way to get it , right?
right?
right .
good .
we in four deep with your punk ass .
gas face me again , i'm gonna ride you all the way down .
you know what i'm saying?
i hear you , ice .
what's this?
half your wages .
half?
that don't feed the coon dog , man .
emery ... ... you know my situation?
i know you got more pride than sense .
hey , don't bust my chops .
i've had enough of that for one day .
why give your wife the high hat?
ex .
that's none of your business .
yeah?
this is my business right here , captain john .
so you quit your crying and tell me a tale before i pass a slap .
we met on an oil rig in texas .
i was the hotshot extracting big traps nobody else could .
she was gonna make the petroleum business environmentally friendly .
one , two , six , we fall in love ... ... get married .
there was a ...
there was a blowout .
two roughnecks got killed .
the company said it wasn't my fault ... ... but it was .
people died on my watch .
so i took the jacket .
i walked away .
came back home to be a fisherman like my daddy .
kelli didn't .
why?
she said i was punishing myself needlessly .
she didn't want to be a part of that .
you know ... ... our lives don't belong to us , man .
we belong to god .
and sometimes god allows accidents to happen .
there are no accidents .
okay , then a gift from god .
you know , like a second chance .
don't be stupid , john .
take it .
everyone worries about the great white ... ... but in fact , the bull shark ... ... is responsible for more attacks on people than any other species .
it's big , up to 1 2 feet ... ... territorial , extremely aggressive .
who is it?
it's me .
it prefers to feed in shallow water , which , not incidentally ... ... is where most human aquatic recreational activity ...
when do you want to leave?
as soon as possible .
tomorrow at dawn .
freshwater shark attacks are extremely rare .
be careful what you wish for .
this specimen's probably out to sea by now .
i expect the atchafalaya river is as safe as a swimming pool .
who's that one?
st. honorius ... ... patron saint of oil refiners .
oil refiners?
damn , emery , you got one for every occasion .
what's all this stuff y'all got anyway?
to help me prepare an environmental lmpact statement for the epa .
not to mention hold off save the river lawsuits .
what kind of clown wears yachting duds to go up the atchafalaya?
the kind whose father is on the board of directors .
so he's your boss?
no , but he will be .
well , i'll call you when i get there .
yeah , boy , i can see why you left her to come back here .
she's dumb , no sense of humour , and she's ugly too .
just cast off , mr. broussard .
yes , sir , captain , sir .
we're shoving off .
so how'd they find out?
this was all supposed to be on the q . t .
we'll get there soon .
i don't know who's responsible .
i'll get to the bottom of it .
i'll call you .
would you ...?
hey , hey , hey .
what's your problem , man?
i told you we were leaving .
i lost my cell phone .
i'm sure daddy will buy a new one .
when the captain says something , he means it , yeah?
yeah .
houston thinks global's on to the site .
already?
they might be sending a team in .
they can't work our lease .
if the field's as big as it looks , they can cut in from the edges .
yeah , but we've still got a jump on them .
look , how i got my slot is no secret ... ... but i have a genuine vision for this company .
what?
drilling in every wilderness area you can swing?
in case you haven't noticed , dr. raymond ... ... this country runs on petroleum .
as long as we depend on imports , we're vulnerable ... ... to embargo and the whims of foreign governments .
this isn't just a job to me ... ... it's a mission .
well , hats and horns .
what are you shooting at , boy?
what'd you do , dale , declare no limit day?
that girl who died yesterday was tricia leighton .
her daddy's ...
leighton chemical?
right .
he's put a bounty on the shark , $50, 000 .
i'm thinking about getting my own fishing pole .
well , i hope you bag him .
no , no , no .
where do you think you're going?
upriver .
no can do , john .
whole basin's closed north of here .
because of one shark attack?
two in 24 hours .
that boy you found , andre gautreaux , he finally talked .
his grandpappy got taken up near belle point yesterday morning .
poor kid .
but , dale , lake verret , belle point .
the shark's heading this way .
that's why everybody's here .
the shark's gotta pass this bend to make the gulf .
dale ... ... i need this gig .
go on , captain .
thanks , pal .
just do me a favour , john .
don't get eaten by that shark .
it'd reflect mighty poorly on me .
roger that .
emery , let's go .
y'all see anything?
nothing .
let's see if that thing works .
why are we stopping?
gotta fix that fuel leak .
and emery hadn't seen his family in a month .
i didn't agree to this .
now's your chance .
god , it's like a scene from deliverance .
relax , gene , nobody's gonna make you squeal like a pig .
why do you have to yank his chain?
he just makes it too damn easy .
you never took me to the bayou before .
you never wanted to come .
but there is a certain charm to the simple life , no?
dance?
i didn't come here to dance .
that's my girl , all business .
that's what this is about , john , business .
okay .
you know i'm gonna have to dive for samples in the cove .
any chance i'll wind up shark food?
i doubt it .
okay , let's ask .
well , what'd he say last night?
has that thing gone out to sea or not?
grand vieux says there's a legend called le gardien de l 'anse noire .
kind of a spirit that protects the black cove .
with all due respect , i was referring to a shark ... ... not some spirit in a folktale .
maybe the shark's the form that spirit takes .
or maybe grand vieux is just a crazy old cajun .
don't mind emery .
he's got one foot in the 21 st century , one in the 18th .
hey , at least i got laid last night .
take care , my brother .
les mchoires du mort .
translation?
the jaws of death .
are you serious?
no , he's just hung over .
keep a sharp lookout .
if we're lucky , we'll encounter ursus americanus luteolus ... ... the rare and endangered louisiana black bear .
damn !
they can see a quarter from the moon ... ... but they can't make a cell phone work in the bayou .
what?
nothing but a bunch of ... ... muck and crawfish .
so , jerry , you wouldn't be honking our geese , would you?
come on , guys .
it's been five years .
every spring , the rains come , change the course of the river .
i'm doing the best i can , all right?
i'm gonna say this one time .
your best better get better .
what are you waiting for?
you're going to kill me anyway .
send me home to mama , bitch .
come on !
come on .
cool it !
back off .
nobody's gonna kill you , jeremiah , okay?
now , you're a standup kind of guy , right?
get with the program ... ... and maybe you'll come out of this with a little compensation .
look .
we've got company .
here come the bigwigs .
i should've shined my boots .
how'd the global team beat us here?
we shouldn't have stopped .
ahoy .
ahoy , hank .
what happened to your hair?
wife , kids , two dogs and a mother in law .
here you go .
hi , hank .
dr. raymond .
welcome back , john .
thanks .
who are those guys?
not a clue , mr. bradley .
they must have slipped in last night .
they were here when we woke up .
this is discovery's lease .
why don't you tell them to vacate the area .
it's not in my job description , sir .
heavenly , isn't it?
nature exists in perfect harmony ... ... free from war and corruption .
then man comes along and spoils everything .
can i get a shot of you on the bridge?
sure .
so far , we've been able to protect this refuge ... ... but now some big oil company has moved in .
we're suing , organizing protests .
we're going to stop the aggression !
we're going to save this sanctuary .
we're going to preserve the peaceful serenity ...
damn .
last dive today .
why?
too much bottom time .
you get bubbles in your blood .
how's the volume?
still below 3000 , but looks like the mud is rising .
you don't wanna be here if it gets into the red .
blowout?
don't say that word .
don't even think it .
just let me know if the level gets close .
according to the spectro ... ... i should be drilling into the heart of the trap .
but all the cuttings are still impermeable .
any signs of hydrocarbons?
only traces .
that global team's just waiting for us to drop the ball .
what do you want to do?
how far down?
five five .
let's change the bha .
what do you have in mind?
i think we might have missed the reservoir .
we'll change the drill string , put in some flex ... ... come back through here .
give me a couple hours?
thank you , hank .
all right , boys !
we're tripping out the drill !
where are they?
what do you need?
my specimen cups .
i can't find my specimen cups .
thank you .
so , what kind of samples you taking?
water , sediment ... ... crawfish are always a good indicator .
i'll live .
hey , kel .
what?
i checked the sonar .
nothing bigger than a largemouth bass .
i'll keep an eye on it .
if i see anything , i'll flash the floods .
kelli , while you're down there , do a little recon on those global boys .
okay .
you think they're looking for oil with metal detectors?
what else?
some lady , isn't she?
do me a favour , gene .
don't talk about my wife .
ex wife !
loser .
ahoy , atchafalaya queen !
hey , buddy !
there was a shark attack .
you might want to tell your divers .
suit yourself .
where the hell is brett?
how should i know?
what am i , his dive buddy?
maybe he found a mermaid .
help !
john , help !
i found him passed out .
are you okay?
yeah .
all right , let's get him in the boat .
okay .
okay , buddy .
nasty .
you have no idea .
what's your name?
vanrooyen .
brett vanrooyen .
easy .
who you with?
you're with global , right?
what is he talking about?
global .
only the world's third largest oil company .
you're their advance team , right?
wrong .
you're trespassing on our lease .
my apologies .
i want you out of here !
give it a rest !
he could have died .
it's none of my business .
this used to be a free country ... ... but what are you diving for?
sunken treasure , of course .
yo , brett !
you okay , dog?
permission to board?
granted .
thanks .
damn , homey !
was it a shark?
no .
no , it was a pontiac .
this is our lease .
it gives us exclusive rights to the entire cove .
we're not looking for oil .
just a little recreational diving .
we'll be gone tomorrow .
i'm ordering you to vacate this area immediately .
who you giving orders , fool?
what , you a cop?
you 5 0?
popo , what?
hey .
come on , gene .
just let them do their thing .
get your hand off me .
i'm calling the basin police .
yo , homey !
hey !

who you giving orders , fool?
god .
yeah .

they can't hear us .
ahoy , captain danders .
it's dale landry .

howdy , john .
you had me worried there , son .
where is everybody?
lunch?
okay .
whatever you do , stay out of the water .
there was another shark attack this morning by foulaneaux .
the reward's been doubled to $1 00 , 000 ... ... so if you land him , we're partners .
well done .
you really want to turn this into a blood fest?
look .
they've seen our faces , and they know your name .
not the one i was born with .
that's you , all right?
i can't take them kind of chances .
you make it any tighter , he'll lose that leg .
if i don't , he'll lose more than that .
femoral's been clipped .
don't let me die .
our lives don't belong to us , partner .
jerry .
we can't stop the bleeding .
he needs a doctor !
yeah .
he should have thought about that before he got chesty .
get up .
everybody on your knees .

especially holding his piece like he's in a rap video .
you could be first , hero .

watkin city harbour master calling bitter end .

your antenna's blown to hell .

how do i shut down this mess?
this is not a trick question .
answer me !
we gotta close it down from the riverbed .

be aware down there .
hey , after all we've been through today ... ... i sure as hell ain't worried about some fish .
good .
shark !
shark !
behind you !
john , shark !
stay still , partner !
hurry , come in !
god , john .
stay still?
stay still , he won't think you're prey .
stay still?
come on , you know that .
you're a fisherman .
okay , all right .

stay still , stay still .
stay still , stay still .
my ass !
john , swim !
come on , you can do it !
come on , man , swim !
stay still , huh?

yeah !
take that fool !
you're the fool , ice .
shut up before i throw you over the side .
we gotta get our asses out of here .
that's what we gotta do .
not without the money , honey .
who do you think is stupid enough to get back in the water with that thing?
so , what's in the box?
all i could salvage from the magazine .
hang on , gene .
don't give up .
who's that one?
st. vitus .
really?
and what's st. vitus gonna do for us?
provide protection from attack by wild beasts .
i thought that shark went back out to sea .
so did i.
no , he come home .
the guardian of the black cove .
he don't like us being here .
did you get it?
did you get it?
the shark?
i don't know .
you don't know?
what you mean , you don't know?
what we gonna do now?
i'll think of something .
they're going to kill us , aren't they?
only if we let them .
kelli?
i'm here , gene .
we had a blowout , didn't we?
yeah .
have we hit pay dirt?
yeah , bigtime .
so i was right?
yeah , you were right .
i was right .
why is this happening?
why doesn't matter .
it just is .
you know , people have been killing sharks for years .
most species are almost extinct .
maybe they're just tired of it .
maybe .
maybe something else .
maybe retribution , yeah?
everybody on this boat is greedy .
they want money , they want power , they want oil .
we was put on this earth to give , not to take .
the wrath of a vengeful god?
lf the gumboot fits , partner .
or maybe that shark's just hungry , yeah?
we scared away the fish he usually eats .
and now we on the menu .
stop it !
i love sharks , kelli .
i admire them .
they kill without remorse .
they kill or starve .
gene is dead .
you must love that .
i didn't kill him .
i've never killed any human being .
you're one of those good bad guys with a code of honour .
i'm not a bad guy at all .
spare me .
well , that's exactly what i intend to do .
i had a band once .
oh , yeah?
what'd you call it?
jerry and the idiots?
we were actually pretty good , dog .
it's a tough business to get into .
you need somebody on the inside , right?
someone on your team .
you're a whole lot dumber than you look .
which is why you don't have to suit up ... ... because you saved my life today .
am i supposed to be grateful?
is that what you want?
for me to show my gratitude?
why , kelli , whatever did you have in mind?
hands up !
drop the knife !
well , which is it , pal?
hands up or drop the knife?
hands up or drop the knife?
don't kill him .
why the hell not?
they're going for a little night dive .
all clear .
this is crazy .
like i wanna go diving with that guppy .
shut up .
just do it , all right?
dumb ass fish probably got blown up anyway .
farmer john goes down first .
what's wrong , emery?
i mean , other than the general terror of the situation?
come again?
i can't swim .
you can't swim?
you've been a fisherman all your life and you can't swim?
i'm sorry , john .
it's okay , partner .
hey , my man can't swim .
prove it .
kiss my ass .
i want three men in that water , and i want that money .
now , move it .
i'll go .
no , honey .
you're staying right here with me .
you say you never killed anyone .
you wanna start by drowning a man who can't swim?
smart .
smart , ballsy , devious .
you've got all the trimmings , don't you , baby?
you sure you wanna do this?
hell , no .
it just beats the alternatives .
listen to me .
if you find that money , you flash your light three times .
swim to the moon pool .
i'll meet you there .
do not come back to this boat .
what about him?
we'll trade the money for emery , and maybe we'll get out of this alive .
okay .
i may not get another chance to say this ...
divers in the water !
now !
got the money , honey .
yeah !
it got john !
give me the spear gun !
it's on the bottom .
a knife !
anything !
whoa , whoa !
back off !
you are not going back in that water .
money .
honey .
fetti .
cheese .
cash .
snaps .
quit playing and open the damn case , jerry .
i'm trying .
jerry , you didn't forget the combination , now , did you?
no , 1 7 5 3 .
i know these numbers better than my ex wife's cup size .
i've been living them every night for five years .
get your ass out of the way .
forget it , man .
damn !
you idiot .
put that thing away .
the whole thing's rusted solid , okay?
we'll open it when we get back to rick's .
i don't think so , homey .
because we ain't going back to rick's .
see , my cousin rick ... ... he pay me chump change and treat me like a scrub .
so i gotta ask jerry , jerry ...
i'm all like , some of 3 million or being trunk music?
tough call , huh , brett?
who got at who?
why don't you go for a night dive .
we transfer whatever gear we need over to the queen ... ... then scuttle this tub , like it sunk in the blowout .
what about them?
shoot them?
we don't want to leave any evidence .
we cut them , make them bleed , feed them to the shark .
damn , jerry .
you're a cold pimp .
thanks .
get up .
get up !
let's go .
that dog never caught on .
go figure .
slumming with rick , right?
greedy and stupid , both of them .
hey , rick still got that piranha thing?
y'all ...
look out !

i been working five long years for this score ... ... and i'm not gonna let some fisherman take it away !
kelli !
emery !
jump in the water and swim over here !
you crazy?
she'll tow you !
vengeance is mine , man !
payback time !
little man walk tall !
