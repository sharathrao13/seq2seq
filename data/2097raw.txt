it could have happened to anybody .
and it was three goddamn years ago !
the iittle fucker had thrown aii my papers aii over the floor .
aii i tried to do was puii him up .
a momentary ioss of muscular coordination .
i mean . . . . . . a few extra foot pounds of energy . . . . . . per second , per second !
thank god you're here .
there's someone else in the hotei with us .
there's a crazy woman in one of the rooms .
she tried to strangle danny .
are you out of your fucking mind?
it's the truth .
i swear it !
danny told me .
he went up into one of the bedrooms .
the door was open , and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub .
she tried to strangle him !
which room was it?
from channel 1 0 in miami ... ... this is newswatch with glen rinker ... ... ann bishop , and the award winning newswatch team .
good evening .
i'm glen rinker , newswatch ten .
as miami continues to swelter in a record winter heat wave ... ... bringing temperatures to the 90s ... ...
central and mountain states are buried in snow .
in colorado , 10 inches of snow fell in just a few hours tonight .
travel in the rockies is almost impossible .
airports are shut down , stranding thousands of passengers .
highways are blocked by snowdrifts .
railroad tracks are frozen .
officials in colorado tell newswatch . . . ... at least 3 have been killed by exposure to freezing winds .
the governor of colorado is expected ... ... to declare a weather emergency .
the national guard might be called out ... ... to clear roads .
forecasters predict more snow ... ... and heavy winds tonight and tomorrow ... ... with temperatures dropping well below zero .
back here in florida , we've got the opposite problem .
the heat and humidity are supposed to climb .
local beaches should be jammed .
our weather expert , walter cronice ... ... will have the local forecast later on newswatch .
we're sorry .
your call cannot be completed as dialed .
if you need assistance , please call the operator .
yes , it's me .
thank god .
did you find anything?
no .
nothing at ail .
i didn't see one goddamn thing .
you went into the room danny said?
to 237?
yes , i did .
and you didn't see anything at ail?
absolutely nothing .
how is he?
he's stiii asleep .
good .
i'm sure he'ii be himself again in the morning .
are you sure it was the right room?
i mean , maybe danny made a mistake .
he must have gone in that room .
the door was open , the iights were on .
i just don't understand it .
what about those bruises on his neck?
somebody did that to him .
i think . . .
. . . he did it to himself .
no .
that's not possible .
once you rule out his version of what happened . . . . . . there is no other explanation .
is there?
whatever the explanation is ...
... i think we ... ... have to get danny out of here .
get him out of here?
you mean . . .
. . . just ieave the hotel?
it is so ... . . . typicai of you to create a problem iike this . . . . . . when i finaily have a chance to accomplish something !
when i'm reaily into my work !
i could reaily write my own ticket if i went back now , couldn't i?
shoveling out driveways , working in a car wash .

a very wiilfui boy .
a rather . . . . . . naughty boy . . . . . . if i may be so bold , sir .
it's his mother .
she . . . . . . interferes .
perhaps they need a good . . . . . . talking to .
if you don't mind my saying so . . .
. . . perhaps . . . . . . a bit more .
my girls , sir . . . . . . they didn't care for the overlook at first .
