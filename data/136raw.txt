come , come !
please !
aziz .
aziz .
aziz , light !
aziz ...
light .
good .
we start again .
when the three planets are in eclipse ... the black hole , like a door , is open .
evil comes ... spreading terror and chaos .
see the snake , billy?
the ultimate evil .
make sure you get the snake .
yes , i've got your snakes .
i got all the snakes .
when is the snake act supposed to occur?
if this is the five ... and this is the one ...
every 5, 000 years .
so , i've got some time then .
you bring them water .
good boy .
i'll take it to them .
go with god .
be safe from evil .
you see here these different peoples , or symbols of people ... gathering the four elements of life ... water , fire , earth , air ... around a fifth one .
a fifth ... element .
forgive me , lord .
they already know too much .
father .
how are you?
well .
you have some glasses?
of course .
i'm so glad to see you .
it's the most extraordinary thing .
it's the greatest find in history .
you must be parched .
oh , yes , yes .
i'm sorry .
it's like a battle plan .
here the good .
here the evil .
and here , a weapon ... against evil .
i'm going to be famous .
then let us toast to your fame .
to fame .
salute .
you can't toast with water .
billy , in my sack , the grappa .
this i don't understand .
this could be something ... prehistoric .
i don't know .
but , wait .
here .
look , look .
they're here .
this man ... this perfect being .
i know this is the key .
i know it .
this divine light they talk about .
what is divine light?
aziz , light !
much better .
thank you .
my lord .
father , this is the most unbelievable thing i've ever seen .
don't you think?
are you german?
lord ...
i know he was about to discover everything .
but , no worry .
i was there in time .
priest ... you and those before you ... have served us well .
but war is coming .
stones not safe on earth anymore .
this ... is really amazing .
the fifth element .
take the stones .
my lord ... if you take the weapon , we'll be defenseless ... when evil returns .
in 300 years ... when evil returns ... so shall we .
oh , professor .
professor .
don't move !
i have a gun !
please , understand .
they're our friends .
friends?
father , they've killed the professor !
they're monsters !
i'll explain everything .
you're with them?
look at me .
i am your friend .
no , father .
billy , look at me !
please , put ... the gun down .
billy , no !
hurry !
the wall is closing !
pass your knowledge to the next priest ... as it was passed to you .
i will do as you command , but ... hurry , you still have time .
time not important .
only life ... important .
i will fulfill my mission !
you can count on me !
i will pass the knowledge until your return .
anything yet?
not even a temperature?
the analyzers have jammed .
one shows a million degrees , the others minus 5, 000 .
let's see it .
it's taking shape .
send out a probe .
ladies and gentlemen ... the president of the federated territories .
on air with general staedert in 30 seconds .
i saved this seat for you , father .
president on the line .
we're in position .
i have to address the supreme council .
just the facts .
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis yet .
all the calibers are overshot .
we're initiating thermonucleatic imaging .
what you're saying is , you don't know what this is .
all we know is , it just keeps getting bigger .
recommendation?
my philosophy is shoot first and ask questions later .
i don't like uninvited guests .
all right , then .
mr. president?
priest vito cornelius , expert of astrophenomenon .
i ... have a different theory to offer you , sir .
you have 20 seconds .
imagine that this ... thing is not anything that can be identified ... because it prefers not to be .
wherever there is life ... it brings death ... because it's evil .
absolute evil .
one more reason to shoot first .
evil begets evil , mr. president .
shooting will only make it stronger .
probe will obtain objective in five seconds .
growth rate is at 27 % .
your theory is interesting , but we don't have time to go into it .
time is of no importance .
only life is important .
you're right .
that's exactly what we'll do .
we'll protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens .
you may fire when ready .
up front loading of a 120 zr missile .
marker lights on the objective .
its structure solidified on the surface .
i think it's anticipating the attack .
that denotes intelligence .
the most ... terrible intelligence imaginable .
120's loaded .
the ship is in combat formation .
missiles are loaded .
staedert .
yes , sir .
i have a doubt .
i don't , mr. president .
what happened?
can you hear me?
what happened?
did you destroy it?
i'm about to .
the planet has increased diameter by 200 % .
it's moving toward the ship .
what do we have that's bigger than 240?
nothing , sir .
staedert , do you hear me?
get out of there .
i don't want an incident .
do you hear me?
get out of there .
can you hear me , staedert?
do you understand?
listen .
that's an order .
do you understand me?
do you hear me?
get out of there !
good god !
four a day .
i'm tryin '.
to quit is my goal .
i'm up .
all right , i'm up .
god .
hey , dog brain , finger here .
hi , sweetie .
i love you too .
you haven't called me that since basic training .
i was talking to the cat .
i forgot ... you prefer your cat to the real thing .
at least the cat comes back .
still pining for that two timing slut?
there's millions out there .
i don't want a million .
i just want one .
the perfect one .
it don't exist , major .
yeah , i know .
what?
picture of you .
how do i look?
like shit .
must be an old picture .
bring me your hack for a six month overhaul .
negative .
a. s. a. p.
i don't need one .
who sat next to you for 1, 000 missions?
i know how you drive .
finger , i drive a cab now ... not a space fighter .
tell me .
how many points you got left on your license?
major , how many points?
at least 50 .
know what?
you gotta learn to lie better .
see you tonight .
welcome to paradise .
welcome to fhloston paradise .
it's ruby rhod , and i'll tell you live at five ... the winner of the super green gemini croquette contest !
the winner will go with me for two days to fhloston paradise .
tune in to radio cosmos .
don't watch all day .
it'll rot your brain .
for a perfect world .
give me the cash .
been here long?
long enough .
give me the cash .
is that a z 140?
alleviated titanium .
neurocharged assault model .
good thing for me it's not loaded .
it's not loaded?
you have to ... push that yellow button to load it .
take your time .
want me to
there you go .
give me the cash !
that's a very dangerous gun .
maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you .
you don't mind , do you?
you sure?
no .
take it .
i don't need it .
that's a nice hat .
you like it?
god !
please enter your license .
yes , just a minute .
welcome , mr. dallas .
good morning .
sleep well?
me too .
i had a horrible nightmare .
propulsion 2 x 4 .
you have five points left on your license .
yeah , thank you for reminding me .
have a nice day .
why not?
you have 48 hours .
that's the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions .
and then?
then it will be too late .
the goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power ... but to exterminate life .
all forms of life .
you're telling me there's nothing that can stop this .
there is only one thing .
the mondoshawan have in their possession the weapon to defeat evil .
four elements ... gathered around a fifth ... supreme being , the ultimate warrior ... created to protect life .
together they produce " the light of creation .
able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe .
but , if ... evil stands there ...
then what?
then light turns to dark .
life to death ... forever .
a mondoshawan spaceship requests permission to enter our territory .
give it permission to enter with our warmest regards .
thank you .
permission to enter granted .
show time .
we are lost .
aknot , we are connected to earth .
mr. zorg's office .
it's aknot .
i'm so glad to hear you , aknot .
the mission is accomplished .
you'll have what you asked for in a few hours .
good .
i'll meet you at my factory .
the attack was by two unregistered warships .
close all borders and declare a state of general alert .
try to contact the mondoshawans .
we owe them an explanation .
three hundred years of waiting for nothing .
go get some rest .
no .
the mondoshawan ...
i am their contact .
they will come for me .
this is government business .
i'll keep you informed .
the rescue team has reported from the crash site .
any survivors?
only one .
you call that a survivor?
a few cells still alive .
more than i need .
have you identified it?
the computer went off the charts .
normal human beings have 40 dna memo groups ... which is enough for any species to perpetuate .
this has 200, 000 memo groups .
sounds like a freak of nature .
yeah , can't wait to meet him .
you okay?
over here .
excuse me .
general , i want to show you something .
this is a normal human dna chain .
you , me , anybody , right?
watch this .
the compositional elements of his dna chain are like ours .
there's simply more of them , with infinite genetic knowledge .
almost like this being was engineered .
is there any danger?
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector .
the cell is , for lack of a better word ... perfect .
go ahead .
mr. perfect better be polite .
otherwise , i turn him into cat food .
activate it .
tissue processing .
ten seconds to ultraviolet protection .
this is the last phase .
the cells are bombarded by atoms which forces the body to react .
that means growing skin .
wonderful .
reconstruction complete .
remove the shield .
i told you .
perfect .
thermal bandages .
i'd ...
like to take a few pictures ... for the archives .
what's she saying?
i don't know .
activate the phonic detector .
is that thing solid?
unbreakable .
good .
if you want out ... you'll have to develop those communication skills .
general alert .
perfect .
ladder on 18 .
two men with me .
the rest in the main ventilation .
this way .
lady , stay calm .
this is the police .
there's nowhere else to go .
slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor .
do you understand?
she doesn't .
i think we need a flying unit .
this is the police .
this is the police .
we are processing your identification .
put your arms up and follow our instructions .
she has no file .
she dove off .
you just had an accident .
yes , i know i just had an accident , you daffy bastard !

sorry .

i only have one point left on my license .
i need it to get back to the garage and get the cab a six month overhaul .
you understand?

i repeat ... open the passenger door .
yeah , yeah , sure .
why not?
thank you for your cooperation .

finger's going to kill me .
emergency !
emergency !
one point has been removed .
yes , i know !
this is so stupid .
assist in pursuit of yellow cab .
unit 47 , we're on the way ... after we finish lunch .
two golden menus .
i'm too old , too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod .
thank you so much .
and i'm definitely too thirsty .
look out !
we got lucky .
if they don't chase you after a mile , they don't chase you .
maybe two miles .
hang on .
look , lady ...
i only speak english and bad english !
run an id .
i'm all for conversation , but maybe you can just shut up for a minute !
he's got a scan blocker .
means he's a car thief .
blast him .
i don't know what you did ... but they are pissed off !
hold on !
we're safe for a while .
you want to play soft?
i'll play soft .
you want to play hard?
let's play hard .
if we get to the fog , we'll be okay .
if we make the fog .
how do they expect us to find anything in this shit?
we're just going to wait here until things quiet down if you don't mind .
shit .
you okay?
priest .
you don't need a priest , just a doctor .
vito cornelius .
what?
priest .
yes?
i'm looking for a priest .
the weddings are downstairs , my son .
congratulations .
she's not my bride .
she's my fare .
she's looking for vito cornelius .
the phone book said he lived here .
yes , that's me , but i don't know who she is .
nobody does .
no file , no id , nothing .
she's got a tattoo on this arm .
tattoo?
fifth ... element .
finger's going to kill me .
hey !
wake up !
who are you?
i brought the girl , remember?
the redhead .
she just dropped in on me .
started speaking a bizarre language .
it's not bizarre .
it's the divine language .
it's the ancient language ... spoken throughout the universe before time was time .
he's a she .
you noticed that .
yes .
it's a miracle .
miracle she's not dead .
not a moment to lose .
wake her up .
but gently , because this woman is ... mankind's most precious possession .
she is perfect .
perfect .
more dignified .
hey , lady ... wake up .
i shouldn't have done that .
it was wrong to kiss you .
he said to wake you gently .
you're right .
just thought you might remember me from the cab .
remember?
bada boom?
big bada boom?
boom .
big bada boom .
in the cab .

korben dallas .
korben .

just kidding .
what is your name?

korben .
leeloo minai lekarariba laminai tchai ekbat de sebat .
good .
all that's your name?
do you have ... a shorter name?
short .
korben dallas .
leeloo .
leeloo .
korben , leeloo .
leeloo , korben .
you're sure she's a supreme being?
absolutely sure .
old friends .
yeah , you're right .
ask her for my gun back .
what's your name?
korben dallas .
thank you for your help .
you've been kind , but now the girl needs to rest .
she's been on a long trip .
i know .
i was there when she landed .
wait , wait , father .
she said something i didn't understand .
what does " ekto gamat " mean?
never without my permission .
that's what i thought .
i shouldn't have kissed her .
oh , no .
i'm so sorry .
i forgot your food .
how about some nice thai food?
yeah , yeah , hold on .
buddy , i'm waiting all day here .
finger .
where's the cab?
car's running fine .
fine .
what " fine "?
i know you .
fine " ain't in your vocabulary .
you can tell your old buddy finger what happened .
what?
you save the planet?
you dinged the fender again .
that's it , right?
i was on my way to see you , and a fare fell in my lap .
one of these big fares you can't resist .
how big?
five nine ... blue eyes ...
long legs , great skin .
you know?
perfect .
i see .
and this perfect fare , she got a name?
leeloo .
what's she doing?
learning our history , the last 5, 000 years that she missed .
she's been asleep for a while .
i know she's been through a lot , but we don't have much time .
you're right .
chicken .
good .
chicken .
i'm really sorry to interrupt you , but ... the case ... with the stones ... where is it?
stolen?
who in god's name would do such a thing?
excuse me , sir .
the council is worried about the economy heating up .
is it possible to fire 500, 000?
i thought from a smaller company , like one of the cab companies .
fire one million .
but 500, 000
one million .
fine , sir .
sorry to have disturbed you .
it's for the supreme ...
sorry .
i didn't know your size , and i found you this makeup box .
you just put it like that .
yes , there was a man with a limp ... came here a month ago asking about the stones .
said he was an art dealer .
what was his name?
i'm bad with names .
they really make her  perfect , i know .
what'd she say?
she says she knows exactly where they are .
my dear aknot , how about those two planes you borrowed?
aknot , is that you?
what an ugly face .
it doesn't suit you .
take it off .
that's better .
never be ashamed of who you are .
you're warriors .
be proud .
so what if the federal government scattered you to the wind .
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger .
your time for revenge is at hand .
the zf 1 .
it's light .
the handle's adjustable for easy carrying .
breaks down into four parts , undetectable by x ray .
discreet .
titanium recharger , 3, 000 round clip , with bursts of 3 to 300 .
with the replay button , a zorg invention , it's even easier .
one shot ... and replay sends every following shot to the same location .
and to finish the job , all the zorg oldies but goldies .
rocket launcher .
arrow launcher ... with exploding or poisonous heads .
very practical .
net launcher .
the flamethrower .
my favorite .
and for the grand finale ... the new ice cube system .
four full crates ... delivered right on time .
and what about you , dear aknot?
did you bring what i asked?
yes .
magnificent .
this
this case is empty .
empty?
empty ... the opposite of full .
this case is supposed to be full !
anyone care to explain?
the guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust .
who took another route .
she's supposed to contact this person ... in a hotel .
and she's looking for the address .
easy .
dot .
it's planet fhloston , in the angel constellation .
we're saved .
i'm screwed .
you asked for a case .
we brought one .
a case with four stones in it !
not one or two or three , but four !
four stones !
but what the hell am i supposed to do with an empty case?
we are warriors , not merchants .
but you can still count !
look at my fingers .
four stones , four crates .
zero stones , zero crates !
pack everything up !
we're out of here !
we risked our lives .
i believe a little compensation is in order .
so you are merchants after all .
leave him one crate for the cause .
i don't like warriors .
narrow minded , no subtlety ... and they fight for hopeless causes , honor .
honor's killed millions of people .
hasn't saved a single one .
i'll tell you what i do like : a killer .
a dyed in the wool killer , cold blooded , clean and methodical .
a real killer picking up the zf 1 ... would've asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun .
bring me the priest .
i got everything we need to know about fhloston paradise ... and a blueprint of the hotel .
good work , my son .
now to find a way there .
it won't be easy .
there's a charity ball tomorrow .
flights are full , and the hotel will be guarded .
there must be a way .
i'll get it .
weddings?
not really .
mr. zorg would like to talk to you .
who?
mr. zorg .
jean baptiste ...
emmanuel ...
zorg .
it's nice to see you again , father .
i remember you now .
the so called art dealer .
i'm glad you got your memory back .
because you'll need it .
where are the stones?
i don't know .
if i did , i wouldn't tell someone like you .
why?
what's wrong with me?
i try to serve life .
but you only ... want to destroy it .
father ... you're so wrong .
let me explain .
life , which you so nobly serve , comes from destruction and chaos .
take this empty glass .
here it is , peaceful ... boring .
but if it is ... destroyed .
look at all these little things .
so busy now .
notice how each is useful .
what a lovely ballet ensues ... so full of form and color .
now think of all those people that created them .
technicians , engineers .
people who can feed their children tonight ... so those children can grow up and have children ... and so on .
thus adding to the great chain ... of life .
water .
fruit .
you see , father , by creating a little destruction ...
i'm encouraging life .
in reality , you and i are in the same business .
cheers .
where's the robot to pat you on the back?
or the engineer?
or their children , maybe?
there , you see how all your so called power counts for nothing?
how your entire empire of destruction comes ... crashing down ... all because of one , little ... cherry .
you saved my life ... and in return , i'll spare yours ... for now .
you're a monster , zorg .
i know .
torture who you have to , the president , i don't care .
just bring me the stones .
you have one hour .
it's gobbling up all the satellites in the galaxy .
why is it eating up all the satellites?
we're working on it .
the mondoshawan deplore the incident but accept our apologies .
and the stones?
did you find them?
they weren't on board .
what?
the mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race .
they gave them to someone they do trust .
her name is plavalaguna .
she's a diva .
she's singing at a charity ball in fhloston paradise .
she has the stones .
the mondoshawans will help .
we must send someone ... to get the stones .
excellent .
i want this operation to be as discreet as possible .
no troops .
no big operation .
i want your best man to go undercover .
i have the perfect one .
you've got a message .
not opening it?
could be important .
like the last two were important .
first one was from my wife telling me she's leaving .
the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife .
that is bad luck .
grandfather say ...
it never rain everyday .
this is good news , guaranteed .
i bet you lunch .
okay .
come on .
you are fired .
oh , i'm sorry .
at least i won lunch .
good philosophy .
see good in bad .
i like .
hello .
korben , sweetheart .
you got broken fingers?
you can't punch my number?
hi , mom .
seventeen messages .
don't say your machine is broken again .
they last 1, 000 years .
mr. kim , you should go .
this'll take a minute .
you don't feed your cat a croquette , who you love more than me .
she didn't breast feed you .
i did .
good fortune for you .
you don't have a girl .
i'll never be a grandmother .
it bring you good luck !
my body's failing .
take me on this trip .
what are you talking about?
you want to make me beg?
no , all i want is an explanation .
i just got in .
i just smashed my cab .
i lost my job .
i got mugged .
besides that , everything's peachy .
thanks for asking .
now settle down and explain this to me .
you don't know you won a trip ... to fhloston paradise for two for ten days?
i suppose you'll just leave me on the lunar surface?
if i'd won a trip , i'd know .
i would've been notified .
they've been blaring your name out on the radio for an hour .
i'll call you back .
general , how nice to see you in the 5000 block .
nice apartment .
you've settled into a wonderful life .
heard you lost your job .
you heard that?
don't worry .
i'll get another job .
don't bother .
we have one for you .
major dallas ... you've been selected for a mission .
what mission?
to save the world .
you leave for fhloston paradise .
get four stones from the diva plavalaguna and bring them back .
any questions?
why me?
i retired six months ago .
remember?
three reasons .
as a member of the elite special forces unit ... you are an expert in the use of all necessary weapons and spacecraft .
you're the most highly decorated member of your unit .
the third?
of all the members of your unit , you're the only one left alive .
check your messages?
i've had enough good news .
might be important .
you're a winner !
you've won the gemini contest and a trip to fhloston paradise for two .
here are your tickets .
you rigged the contest?
congratulations .
you couldn't be more discreet?
old tricks are the best tricks .
major iceborg will accompany you as your wife .
i am not going .
why not?
excuse me , general .
who is it?
who is it?
my wife .
you remarried?
yes ... no .
i just met this girl , but i'm going to marry her .
i love her , but she hates the military .
she knows the military ruined my last marriage .
she can't have anything to do with it .
if she sees you , she'll kill me .
major  you gotta hide somewhere .
you've gotta help me .
we'd love to , but where can we hide?
we don't have time for this .
it's just for one minute .
you have no idea how much you're helping me .
no idea you have no idea .
i'm going to be happily married .
major !
major !
the three of us won't fit .
sure you will .
major !
you're on my foot .
major !
major !
i'm really sorry to resort to this , mr. wallace
dallas .
we heard about your good luck and need your tickets for fhloston .
is this the way priests vacation?
we're on a mission .
what kind?
we have to save the world , my son .
you're gonna save the world?
yes !
down there .
down there .
this is a police control .
this is not an exercise .
come on , get in .
for one minute , all right?
just stay here for one minute .
this is a police control .
don't touch anything .
this is not an exercise .
can you please spread your legs ... and place your hands in the yellow circles .
what are you doing?
saving you so you can save the world .
yeah , but i
i think this is the door .
no name , no number .
let's see it .
are you classified as human?
negative .
i am a meat popsicle .
i found him .
mr. korben dallas?
sir , can you put your hands in the yellow circles , please?
smoke you !
wrong answer .
the police control is now terminated .
thank you for your cooperation .
have a nice day .
we got the guy .
wasn't easy but we bagged him .
thanks for the tip .

you know how to stop this , right?

end of transmission .
that's the best show i ever did .
major dallas has the five elements on board ... and the priest is guiding them to the temple .
we're saved .
the diva said i should take care of you .
humans act so strange .
what do you mean?
everything you created ... is used to destroy .
we call it human nature .
you learn that on your screen?
i'm not finished yet .
i'm up to " v.
v " is good .
some good words in " v.
like what?
valiant .
vulnerable .
very beautiful .
oh , of course , munro !
mr. president?
now what?
we have a problem .
it's advancing?
it's not only advancing , it's moving at incredible speed .
and do you have any idea where it's heading?
korben , there's a general on the phone .
i'll give you the president .
major dallas , i first would like to salute a warrior .
you're a shining example of this army .
in the name of the federation
any idea when you'll get to the point?
a ball of fire 1, 200 miles in diameter heading straight for earth ... and we have no idea how to stop it .
that's the problem .
how much time do we have?
if its speed remains constant , in an hour and 57 minutes .
i'll call you back in two hours .
hello?
they just landed in the desert .
good job , david .
put her in the center .
where?
here?
you got it figured out , father?
this one should be fire .
you know how this works?
theoretically .
the four stones should go around .
the fifth element should be in the middle ... and then the weapon against evil should work .
you've never seen this work?
give me that .
every weapon has a manual .
i'm sure this has one too .
that's it .
that's it .
match up the symbols .
go !
go !
wind .
my man , what you doing?
what?
what you doing?
trying to keep you in the d. j. business .
fire .
done .
what happens?
so , now , we have to open them .
and you know how to do that .
right?
theoretically ...
no .
leeloo , honey , wake up .
you have to help us .
how do you open the stones?
wind blows .
fire burns .
yes , i know all that .
but how do you open these stones?
rain ...
falls .
what does it mean?
i think that
maybe it's a charade .
a game or something .
if we don't get these stones open in five minutes , we're dead .
dead?
yes , dead .
too late .
we've lost contact with them .
three minutes .
i think mine is broken .
why i gotta get the broke one?
we're never gonna make it .
it moved .
show me what you did .
nothing .
shut up , shut up !
show me what you did , step by step .
i was standing here .
quickly .
i put my hands on the top like this , and i said ...
we're not going to make it .
and that's it?
korben , my man .
wind .
she said , " wind blows .
everyone take a stone .
water for water .
fire for fire .
earth for earth .
go !
earth .
open the other one .
korben , my man , i have no fire .
i have no matches .
do you have any?
i stopped smoking .
father , you smoke?
got some matches?
we need some fire .
we're going to die .
don't breathe .
fire .
one minute .
let's go , leeloo .
wake up .
wake up .
it's time for you to work now .
protect life ... until death .
listen to me !
listen to me .
listen , i know you're very tired .
i'll take you on vacation .
a real vacation , just you and me .
but if you don't do something right now ... we'll all die .
what's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?
it'll enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds .
you're right .
you're right .
there are some things ... very nice things worth saving ; beautiful things .
beautiful things .
like love?
yes , love .
that's good .
that's good .
that's a good example .
love is worth saving .
i don't know love .
i don't know love .
i was built to protect , not love .
so there's no use for me other than this .
you're wrong .
you're wrong .
you're wrong .
i need you .
i need you , very much .
why?
because ... because ...
tell her , korben .
tell me .
please .
why you need me?
because ...
tell me .
tell me .
because i
because i love you .
i love you .
10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 , 5 ... 4 , 3 ... 2 ... 1 .
scanner imaging has confirmed the dark planet dead .
the planet seems to have stopped at 62 miles from impact .
what's wrong?
what you screaming for?
every five minutes it's a bomb or something .
i'm leaving .
mr. president .
let me introduce professor mactilburgh who runs the center .
it's an honor , mr. president .

they're ... not ready .
they need ... five more minutes .
you have 20 seconds .
no , ma'am , i tried .
no , ma'am .
who's that?
some woman .
claims to be korben's mother .
give it here .
mrs. dallas , this is the president .
on behalf of the federation
that doesn't even sound like him .
the president's an idiot .
you don't sound like an idiot .
if you don't want to talk to your mother ... just avoid me as usual .
i'll throw myself in traffic .
i'll saran wrap myself to the bed .
